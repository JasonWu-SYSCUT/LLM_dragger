	"user_message1":"Firstly I will give you one positive example and one negetive example for your few-shot learning. Example1: Abstract: 'LMNA gene mutation can cause muscular dystrophy, and post-translational modification plays a critical role in regulating its function. Here, we identify that lamin A is palmitoylated at cysteine 522, 588, and 591 residues, which are reversely catalyzed by palmitoyltransferase zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5) and depalmitoylase a/b hydrolase domain 7 (ABHD7). Furthermore, the metabolite lactate promotes palmitoylation of lamin A by inhibiting the interaction between it and ABHD7. Interestingly, low-level palmitoylation of lamin A promotes, whereas high-level palmitoylation of lamin A inhibits, murine myoblast differentiation. Together, these observations suggest that ABHD7-mediated depalmitoylation of lamin A controls myoblast differentiation.'; PTM discovered: Yes; Vital source text: 'Here, we identify that lamin A is palmitoylated at cysteine 522, 588, and 591 residues'. Example2: Abstract: 'Sepsis is a dysregulated inflammatory consequence of systemic infection. As a result, excessive platelet activation leads to thrombosis and coagulopathy, but we currently lack sufficient understanding of these processes. Here, using the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis, we observed septic thrombosis and neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis) within the mouse vasculature by intravital microscopy. STING activation in platelets was a critical driver of sepsis-induced pathology. Platelet-specific STING deficiency suppressed platelet activation and granule secretion, which alleviated sepsis-induced intravascular thrombosis and NETosis in mice. Mechanistically, sepsis-derived cGAMP promoted the binding of STING to STXBP2, the assembly of SNARE complex, granule secretion, and subsequent septic thrombosis, which probably depended on the palmitoylation of STING. We generated a peptide, C-ST5, to block STING binding to STXBP2. Septic mice treated with C-ST5 showed reduced thrombosis. Overall, platelet activation via STING reveals a potential strategy for limiting life-threatening sepsis-mediated coagulopathy.';PTM discoverd: No.",
