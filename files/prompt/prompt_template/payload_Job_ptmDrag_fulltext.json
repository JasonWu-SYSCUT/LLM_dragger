	"user_message1":"Palmitoylation is a post-translational modification that occurs on cysteine in proteins. In some cases, cysteine is shortened to 'Cys' or 'C'. If the text contains information that the palmitoylation site on a protein is at the Xth amino acid, if the 999th amino acid is the modification site, the text form of 'Cys 999', 'Cysteine 999' or 'C999' will be used as a description of the site. There are three possible situation: If a given literature content mentions palmitoylation of a protein and has a site description similar to the above, the literature content is judged to 'have sites'; If a given literature content describes palmitoylation of a protein without site description, it is judged to be 'possibly have sites'. For example,'Moreover, the protein acyltransferase, DHHC3, palmitoylates TLR9 in the Golgi, and regulates TLR9 trafficking to endosomes.', this sentence described that TLR9 occurs palmitoylation; If the literature content does not mention any palmitoylation, the literature content is judged to have 'no site'. Next, I will provide you with the text of the literature content, then you should determine which of the three types it belongs to according to the above criteria",
