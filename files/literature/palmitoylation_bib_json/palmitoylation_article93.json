    "abstract": "Blockade of programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoints with monoclonal antibodies has shown great promise for cancer treatment, but these antibodies can cause immune-related adverse events in normal organs. Here we report a dual-cell targeted chemo-immunotherapeutic nanoscale coordination polymer (NCP), OxPt/BP, comprising oxaliplatin (OxPt) and 2-bromopalmitic acid (BP), for effective downregulation of PD-L1 expression in both cancer cells and dendritic cells (DCs) by inhibiting palmitoyl acyltransferase DHHC3. OxPt/BP efficiently promotes DC maturation by increasing intracellular oxidative stress and enhancing OxPt-induced immunostimulatory immunogenic cancer cell death. Systemic administration of OxPt/BP reduces the growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic colorectal carcinoma by facilitating the infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes together with reducing the population of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. As a result, OxPt/BP significantly extends mouse survival without causing side effects. This work highlights the potential of NCPs in simultaneously reprogramming cancer cells and DCs for potent cancer treatment.\n"
