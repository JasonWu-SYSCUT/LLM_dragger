    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evolving evidence suggests that besides signaling pathways, platelet activation involves a complex interplay between metabolic pathways to support thrombus growth. Selective targeting of metabolic checkpoints may inhibit platelet activation and provide a novel antiplatelet strategy. We, therefore, examined global metabolic changes that occur during the transition of human platelets from resting to an activated state to identify metabolites and associated pathways that contribute to platelet activation. METHODS: We performed metabolic profiling of resting and convulxin-stimulated human platelet samples. The differential levels, pathway analysis, and PCA (principal component analysis) were performed using Metaboanalyst. Metascape was used for metabolite network construction. RESULTS: Of the 401 metabolites identified, 202 metabolites were significantly upregulated, and 2 metabolites were downregulated in activated platelets. Of all the metabolites, lipids scored highly and constituted approximately 50% of the identification. During activation, aerobic glycolysis supports energy demand and provides glycolytic intermediates required by metabolic pathways. Consistent with this, an important category of metabolites was carbohydrates, particularly the glycolysis intermediates that were significantly upregulated compared with resting platelets. We found that lysophospholipids such as 1-palmitoyl-GPA (glycero-3-phosphatidic acid), 1-stearoyl-GPS (glycero-3-phosphoserine), 1-palmitoyl-GPI (glycerophosphoinositol), 1-stearoyl-GPI, and 1-oleoyl-GPI were upregulated in activated platelets. We speculated that platelet activation could be linked to 1-carbon metabolism, a set of biochemical pathways that involve the transfer and use of 1-carbon units from amino acids, for cellular processes, including nucleotide and lysophospholipid synthesis. In alignment, based on pathway enrichment and network-based prioritization, the metabolites from amino acid metabolism, including serine, glutamate, and branched-chain amino acid pathway were upregulated in activated platelets, which might be supplemented by the high levels of glycolytic intermediates. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic analysis of resting and activated platelets revealed that glycolysis and 1-carbon metabolism are necessary to support platelet activation.\n"
