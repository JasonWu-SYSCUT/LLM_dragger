    "abstract": "Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) serves as a key regulator of the Warburg Effect by catalyzing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the final step of glycolysis. Both the expression level and enzyme activity of LDHA are upregulated in cancers, however, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that LDHA is post-translationally palmitoylated by ZDHHC9 at cysteine 163, which promotes its enzyme activity, lactate production, and reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Replacement of endogenous LDHA with a palmitoylation-deficient mutant leads to reduced pancreatic cancer cell proliferation, increased T-cell infiltration, and limited tumor growth; it also affects pancreatic cancer cell response to chemotherapy. Moreover, LDHA palmitoylation is upregulated in gemcitabine resistant pancreatic cancer cells. Clinically, ZDHHC9 is upregulated in pancreatic cancer and correlated with poor prognoses for patients. Overall, our findings identify ZDHHC9-mediated palmitoylation as a positive regulator of LDHA, with potentially significant implications for cancer etiology and targeted therapy for pancreatic cancer.\n"
