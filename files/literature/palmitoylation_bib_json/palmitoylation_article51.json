    "abstract": "The complex crystal structure of coca butter (CB) is responsible for the unique melting behavior, surface gloss, and mechanical properties of chocolate. While most studies concentrated on the crystalline state of CB, few studied the isotropic liquid state, which has a major impact on the crystallization process and the characteristics of the resulting crystals. In this study, the molecular organizations of the main CB triacylglycerols (TAGs; 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol, palmitoyl-oleoyl-stearoylglycerol, POS, and 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoylglycerol) were studied. The findings revealed the tunning-fork (Tf) conformation, commonly found in the crystalline state, is the least abundant in the isotropic liquid state of CB and pure TAGs. Notably, POS was found to interact with itself in CB, while its molecules with Tf conformation, although in small amounts in the mixture, tend to pair with each other at lower temperatures. These results highlight the significance of POS in CB crystallization and provide insights for developing CB alternatives.\n"
