STING may function as a scaffold to activate TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), but direct cellular evidence remains lacking. Here we show, using single-molecule imaging of STING with enhanced time resolutions down to 5 ms, that STING becomes clustered at the trans-Golgi network (about 20 STING molecules per cluster). The clustering requires STING palmitoylation and the Golgi lipid order defined by cholesterol. Single-molecule imaging of TBK1 reveals that STING clustering enhances the association with TBK1. We thus provide quantitative proof-of-principle for the signaling STING scaffold, reveal the mechanistic role of STING palmitoylation in the STING activation, and resolve the long-standing question of the requirement of STING translocation for triggering the innate immune signaling.\n",

In the present study, we examined whether STING formed the signalingcompetent homocluster at the TGN by photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM).\n\n**Results**\n**Cluster formation of STING at the TGN**\nTo quantitatively analyze the STING cluster, we performed live-cell PALM observation of mEos4b-STING. First, we performed data acquisition using purified mEos4b embedded in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on glass at 33 ms/frame and quantified the blinking and photoactivation based on the kinetic model 27 (Fig. 1a,b). This is the calibration for the actual experiment that is described later. The distribution of fluorescence intensity of mEos4b could be fitted with a single lognormal function based on both Akaike and Bayesian information criteria 28 (Fig. 1c), indicating that only the mEos4b monomer was observed. The measured probability distribution of the number of blinking times before photobleaching (N blink ) and the probability density function of T on were fitted with predicted geometric distribution (Fig. 1d) or single exponential function (Fig. 1e), respectively, which allowed us to estimate <N blink > (=k d /k b ) to be 1.7.\nThe photo-switching behavior of mEos4b in PVA was similar to that in bacterial cells 29 . Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that PVA matrix restricts oxygen accessibility and exerts redox effects, and the imperative necessity arises to validate the methodology. Therefore, to test if we could accurately estimate the number of molecules in clusters using <N blink > , we performed positive control observations. PC3 cells express caveolin but remain devoid of cavin1, thereby resulting in the absence of caveolae. A previous report 30 showed that the transfection of PC3 cells with cavin1 cDNA induced the formation of caveolae. Accordingly, we performed PALM observations of mEos4b-cavin1 in PC3 cells (Fig. 1f, left and middle), taking advantage of the 100% labeling efficiency of cavin1 with mEos4b. The images were binarized (Fig. 1f, right) using a traditional method of kernel density estimation (KDE) 31 , which is applicable to a wide range of objects of observation 32 . By dividing the numbers of emission bursts of mEos4b in clusters with 1 + <N blink > for the unbiased multi-blinking correction 27 , the number of cavin1 molecules in each caveolae (hereafter, denoted as [#cavin1/caveolae]) was determined. The average of [#cavin1/caveolae] was estimated to be 52 \u00b1 2 (Fig. 1g, left), which is close to the previously reported one (50 \u00b1 5) measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) 33 . Another segmentation method of the PALM images, SR-Tesseler 34 , which has been frequently used 32 , gave essentially the similar results (Fig. 1g, right). These results unequivocally affirm the successful quantification of molecular counts in clusters using <N blink > of mEos4b in PVA.\nmEos4b-STING was stably expressed with virus transduction in STING-knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In these cells, the expression level of STING was comparable to that of endogenous STING in MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 1a). mEos4b-STING activated TBK1 and IRF3 with less potency than wild-type (WT) STING. We stimulated the cells with DMXAA (a membrane-permeable STING agonist) for the indicated time and obtained live-cell PALM images (Fig. 1h-k). The number of STING molecules in each cluster (hereafter, denoted as [#STING/cluster]) was determined and we found that the average of [#STING/cluster] increased up to 360 min after stimulation (Fig. 1i,j). The clusters consisting of >800 STING molecules formed around 30-60 min after stimulation (Fig. 1k). SR-Tesseler also gave essentially the similar results (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Importantly, STING clusters were also observed after stimulation with HT-DNA transfection (Supplementary Fig. 3).\nThe average of [#STING/cluster] estimated by performing the PALM data acquisitions at 5 ms/frame, was not significantly different from those at 33 ms/frame (Supplementary Fig. 4). We also corrected multi-blinking of mEos4b by the recently reported model-based correction (MBC) workflow, calibration-free estimation of blinking dynamics 35 , and found no significant difference between two methods of multiple-blinking correction (Supplementary Fig. 5).\nPhosphorylated TBK1 (p-TBK1) and phosphorylated STING (p-STING) emerged 30-60 min after stimulation in cells expressing mEos4b-STING (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Given that STING activates TBK1 at the TGN 26 , not the other domains of the Golgi, these results suggested that mEos4b-STING reached the TGN by that time. To corroborate this, we performed simultaneous dual-color observation of PALM of mEos4b-STING and dSTORM of a cis-Golgi network (CGN) protein, GM130-HaloTag7, or a TGN protein, TGN38-HaloTag7 labeled with SaraFluor650B (SF650B) in living cells. As indicated by arrowheads (Fig. 2a), the mEos4b-STING clusters colocalized with GM130 10 min, not 30 min after stimulation. The quantitative coordinatebased colocalization (CBC) analysis 36 showed that the localization coordinates of mEos4b-STING and GM130-HaloTag7-SF650B were distributed in higher CBC scores (0.7-1.0) more frequently than control 10 min after stimulation, but were reduced to the control level 30 min after stimulation (Fig. 2b,c). In contrast, the mEos4b-STING clusters became extensively colocalized with TGN38 30-60 min after stimulation (Fig. 2d-f). The colocalization of mEos4b-STING with TGN38 then decreased during 60-120 min after stimulation. It is of note that Spearman's correlation coefficients pertaining to the amounts of mEos4b-STING or TGN38-HaloTag7 and the CBC scores 60 min after stimulation consistently fell within the range of -0.3-0.3 across all instances (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results indicated that the colocalization of mEos4b-STING with TGN38-HaloTag7 was less affected by the expression level of mEos4b-STING or TGN38-HaloTag7.\nAfter the exit of STING from the Golgi/TGN, STING translocates to recycling endosomes 26,37 . In line with this, colocalizations of mEos4b-STING with recycling endosomal proteins (transferrin receptor (TfnR) and Rab11) increased only 120-360 min after DMXAA stimulation (Fig. 3a-f).\nIn sum, the PALM analysis (Fig. 1i,j) showed that STING became clustered at the TGN, with some clusters containing >800 STING molecules (Fig. 1k).\n**Palmitoylation of STING is required for the cluster formation at the TGN**\nWe previously demonstrated that STING palmitoylation, the posttranslational modification essential for the STING signaling 26 , facilitated the STING clustering to trigger the activation of TBK1 and IRF3. To prove this, we performed live-cell PALM observation of mEos4b-STING in the presence of palmitoylation inhibitors, 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) and a STING-specific palmitoylation inhibitor H-151 38 (Fig. 4a,b). The treatment with both inhibitors decreased the average of [#STING/ cluster] and suppressed the formation of clusters consisting of >800 STING molecules after stimulation with DMXAA or HT-DNA (Fig. 4c-f, Supplementary Figs. 2b, and3). To further corroborate the role of STING palmitoylation in the STING clustering, we generated STING-KO MEFs stably expressing mEos4b-STING (C88/91S) (Fig. 4g), the palmitoylation deficient variant of STING 26 . Live-cell PALM observation of mEos4b-STING (C88/91S) showed that the average of [#STING/ cluster] of this variant was significantly decreased, compared to that of wild-type (WT) STING (Fig. 4h-j and Supplementary Fig. 2c). mEos4b-STING (C88/91S) was less active in forming the cluster containing >800 STING molecules (Fig. 4k).\n**Cluster formation in the presence of the disease-causative COPA variants**\nCOPA syndrome is a monogenic disorder of immune dysregulation characterized by the increased expression of type I interferonstimulated genes. The disease is caused by heterozygous mutations of the COPA gene 13  complex, which is essential for the retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER and may regulate the anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi. We and others have recently shown that STING was constitutively activated in the disease-causative COPAexpressing cells because of the inefficient retrograde transport of STING to the ER, and that the constitutive activation of STING contributed to the upregulated inflammatory responses in COPA syndrome [14][15][16][17][18] .\nWe stably expressed the disease-causative COPA variants in cells expressing mEos4b-STING and performed live-cell PALM observation. The average of [#STING/cluster] was significantly increased in the COPA variants-expressing cells, compared to control cells (Fig. 5 and  Supplementary Fig. 2d), showing that STING formed the clusters in the COPA variant-expressing cells. Next we examined whether cGAMP, the natural STING ligand, was required for the clustering of STING. To address this question, we exploited cGAS-KO MEFs 16 , in which the production of cGAMP was inhibited. As shown (Supplementary Fig. 7), the average of [#STING/cluster] in cGAS-KO MEF cells expressing COPA(D243G) was significantly larger than that in control cells. These results showed that cGAMP binding to STING was not intrinsically essential for the STING clustering.\n**The role of cholesterol in the STING signaling and clustering**\nWe previously showed that the Golgi lipid order, besides STING palmitoylation, was essential for the STING signaling 26 . Treatment of cells with D-ceramide-C6, which caused a reduced membrane order in the Golgi membrane through the generation of short-chain sphingomyelin 39 , suppressed the STING signaling (Fig. 6a) and decreased the average of [#STING/cluster] (Fig. 6b-d and Supplementary Fig. 2e). In contrast, L-ceramide-C6, a non-metabolizable enantiomer of D-ceramide-C6, had a minimal effect on the average of [#STING/cluster]. Di-4-ANEPPDHQ is a fluorescent probe that exhibits distinct changes in its emission spectrum in response to variations in lipid environment 40 . Notably, it is highly sensitive to the state of lipid packing within cellular membranes 41 . An increase in the concentration of cholesterol in biomembranes enhances lipid packing, thus affecting the emission spectrum of Di-4-ANEPPDHQ. With this probe, we confirmed that D-ceramide-C6, not L-ceramide-C6, caused a reduced membrane order in the Golgi membrane (Supplementary Fig. 8).\nWe sought to examine a role of cholesterol, a lipid essential for the generation of the lipid order 42,43 , in the STING signaling and clustering by interfering with the function of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP). OSBP transports cholesterol from the ER to the TGN 44 , and its function is inhibited by 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) 45 or a plant-derived steroidal saponin OSW-1 46 . Treatment of cells with these compounds (30 \u03bcM of 25-HC for 16 h or 0.125 nM of OSW-1 for 6 h) suppressed the stimulation-dependent emergence of p-TBK1, p-STING, and phosphorylated IRF3 (p-IRF3) (Fig. 7a,b), without affecting the translocation of STING from the ER to the Golgi (Supplementary Fig. 9a-c). Treatment of cells with 25-HC or OSW-1 decreased the average of [#STING/cluster] (Fig. 7c-e and Supplementary Fig. 2f) and suppressed the formation of clusters consisting of >800 STING molecules (Fig. 7f).\nWe have recently developed a cell-free assay 47 using recombinant TBK1 and microsomes harboring STING, so that we can examine whether STING is primed for the phosphorylation by TBK1. When microsomes were prepared from cells stimulated with DMXAA and used for the reaction, STING was phosphorylated 47 (Fig. 7g,h). In contrast, STING was insufficiently phosphorylated when microsomes from cells pretreated with 25-HC or OSW-1 were used. Importantly, the treatment of the microsomes with cholesterol/methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) complex, not M\u03b2CD alone, restored the phosphorylation of STING. Lastly, we performed cholesterol add-back experiments in live cells. STING-KO MEFs stably expressing mEos4b-STING were pretreated with 25-HC or OSW-1, incubated with medium containing cholesterol-methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin complex for 3 h, and then stimulated with DMXAA for 60 min. As shown (Supplementary Fig. 9d,e), the cholesterol add-back to cells restored the formation of p-TBK1, p-STING, and p-IRF3.\nIn sum, these results (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 9) suggested the role of cholesterol in the STING signaling and clustering.\n**The STING cluster colocalizes with cholesterol-enriched domains**\nThe role of cholesterol in the STING signaling and clustering led us to examine the subcellular localization of cholesterol. To visualize cholesterol, we exploited a recently established cholesterol biosensor iD4H (derived from the Clostridium Perfringens theta-toxin) 48 . Recombinant mNeonGreen-tagged iD4H bound to liposomes at which cholesterol exceeded 20% molar content (Supplementary Fig. 10a,b). In the resting state, mRuby3-STING localized at the ER and did not colocalize with puncta positive with mNeonGreen-iD4H (Fig. 7i,j). In contrast, after STING stimulation with DMXAA, mRuby3-STING, especially the one forming puncta at the Rab6 (a TGN protein)-positive area, partly colocalized with mNeonGreen-iD4H. We also noted the stimulation-dependent increase of the signal of mNeonGreen-iD4H at the Rab6-positive area (Fig. 7k).\nThe increased signal of mNeonGreen-iD4H did not colocalize with lipid droplets visualized by Lipi-Blue (Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting that lipid droplet was not involved in the enhanced accumulation of mNeonGreen-iD4H at the TGN.\nThe treatment with OSW-1 suppressed the increase of mNeonGreen-iD4H at the Rab6-positive area (Supplementary Fig. 10c,d). The area of the Rab6-positive region was not affected with OSW-1 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 10e). Intriguingly, palmitoylation inhibitors (2-BP and H-151) abolished the increase of the signal of mNeonGreen-iD4H at the Rab6-positive area (Fig. 7i-k). These results indicated the STING palmitoylation drove the local accumulation of cholesterol in the cytosolic leaflet of the TGN membranes.\nWe also examined the subcellular distribution of cholesterol by filipin, a polyene macrolide antibiotic. As shown (Supplementary Fig. 12), DMXAA stimulation did not increase the signal of filipin at the Rab6-positive area. Thus, the level of the cholesterol in the TGN membranes was not grossly affected by STING stimulation.\nAfter STING stimulation, mNeonGreen-iD4H colocalized also well with TBK1-mScarletI (Supplementary Fig. 10f). The treatment with OSW-1 partially suppressed the TBK1-positive puncta formation, which was also indicated by the remaining cytoplasmic signal of TBK1. The  colocalization of the TBK1-positive puncta with iD4H motivated us to examine the lipid order of the Golgi membranes. We observed that the TBK1-positive puncta showed a high value of the generalized polarization (GP) of di-4-ANEPPDHQ (movie S1). These results suggested that the membrane domains positive with TBK1 had high membrane rigidity or were highly ordered.\n**The clustering of STING facilitates TBK1 recruitment**\nSTING has long been assumed to act as a protein scaffold to recruit and activate TBK1 49 . To directly examine if the clustering of STING facilitates TBK1 recruitment from the cytosol, simultaneous dual-color livecell PALM and single-molecule imaging were performed. We observed that single molecules of TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T molecules were transiently recruited to mEos4b-STING clusters after STING stimulation (Fig. 8a-c, Supplementary Fig. 1c, and movie S2). The lifetime of the colocalization durations of single-molecules of TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T with STING clusters was determined as around 150 ms in DMXAA-stimulated cells (Fig. 8d,e). The result indicated that the large TBK1 clusters shown in Supplementary Fig. 10f were formed by transient recruitment of TBK1 to STING clusters. Treatment of cells with H-151, which reduced the size of STING cluster (Fig. 4c-f), significantly reduced it to 74 ms (Fig. 8d,e). Treatment of cells with MRT67307 (TBK1 inhibitor) 50 reduced it to 92 ms (Fig. 8d,e), but did not affect the size of STING cluster (Supplementary Fig. 13a,b). STING (L373A) lacks the ability to bind TBK1 51,52 . STING (L373A) clustered as wild-type STING (Supplementary Fig. 13b,c), however, the lifetime of colocalization durations of TBK1 with clusters of STING (L373A) was very short and comparable to that of control (Fig. 8d,e).\nWe analyzed the numbers of STING molecules within 100 nm radius around TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T spots and those around randomized TBK1 spots in silico. The histograms of the difference showed that the frequency of TBK1 recruitment (Fig. 8f) and the density of STING around the TBK1 spots (Fig. 8g) were significantly reduced after treatment of cells with H-151 or MRT67307, or in cells expressing STING (L373A).\nThese results suggested that the recruitment of TBK1 to STING was facilitated by a palmitoylation-dependent STING cluster growth, and that the phosphorylation of STING by TBK1, in turn, stabilizes the binding of TBK1 to STING clusters.\n\n**Discussion**\nBy in vitro and in silico analyses, STING is suggested to oligomerize in the presence of cGAMP [51][52][53] , which may facilitate the activation of the STING signaling. However, these results do not explain the reason why TBK1/IRF3 activation occurs at the Golgi/TGN 26,[54][55][56] , not at the ER where STING binds cGAMP. On the basis of the present cellular data by single-molecule localization microscopy, we propose a model underlying STING activation at the TGN (Fig. 8h and Supplementary Fig. 13d): Binding of cGAMP to STING dimer induces conformational change and/or oligomerization of STING 57 , which allows STING to translocate from the ER to cis-Golgi network. STING further translocates to the TGN along the exocytic membrane flow, during which STING undergoes palmitoylation 26 . At the TGN, STING clusters with the aid of the palmitoyl groups on Cys88 and Cys91 on STING (Fig. 4), cholesterol (a lipid directly transported from the ER to the TGN by lipid-transfer proteins 58 (Fig. 7), and sphingomyelin (a lipid synthesized at the TGN) 39 (Fig. 6). Palmitoylation of STING drove the local accumulation of cholesterol in the cytosolic leaflet of the TGN membranes (Fig. 7), which may further facilitate STING clustering given the affinity of palmitoylated proteins and raft lipids 59 .\nBy the analysis of the durations and frequencies of colocalization of TBK1 with STING (Fig. 8), we suggested that STING clustering facilitated TBK1 recruitment. The advantage of STING clustering in TBK1 recruitment may be explained as follows: Once TBK1 is detached from STING, there are other TBK1-free STING molecules around, in addition to the STING molecule that TBK1 originally binds to. Thus, STING clustering increases the encounter probability of TBK1 and STING. Clustering of STING may also be beneficial for TBK1 activation because two TBK1 dimers need to be placed close each other for autophosphorylation/autoactivation.\nWe noted that p-TBK1 was less affected in the conditions where the Golgi cholesterol was reduced (Fig. 7a,b). In contrast, p-TBK1 was severely reduced in the conditions where palmitoylation of STING was inhibited (Fig. 4a,b). We assume that orientation of individual STING molecules in the small STING cluster may differ in the two conditions. In cholesterol-depleted conditions, even a small STING cluster may accommodate two TBK1 dimers simultaneously, thus still facilitating autophosphorylation of TBK1. In contrast, a small cluster that palmitoylation-deficient STING forms may not accommodate two TBK1 dimers.\nThe TGN functions as the central hub for secretory cargo protein sorting and trafficking to the plasma membrane 60 . A number of studies have established a cholesterol-and/or sphingolipid-based system for cargo sorting and membrane-carrier biogenesis at the TGN 61 . In the present study, we showed that a cholesterol-based system at the TGN operated also in triggering the innate immunity signaling. By exploiting a cholesterol biosensor and an environmentally sensitive probe for lipid membranes, we further demonstrated that cholesterol generated a specific membrane domain, or a liquid-ordered domain, in which palmitoylated STING formed clusters to activate TBK1 at the TGN. Our results provided direct evidence of the generation of liquid-ordered lipid microdomain in the TGN, which was originally postulated as \"lipid raft\" by Simons' group 26 years ago 62 . Our results also endorsed in vitro observations that palmitoylation of proteins increased the affinity to liquid-ordered phase 39 .\nSTING activates a wide array of innate immune and proinflammatory genes in addition to the type I interferons. However, the significance of the activation of these genes remains mostly elusive. One example is cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) 63 , which metabolizes cholesterol to 25-HC 64 . Given the inhibitory effect of 25-HC on the STING signaling, the induction of CH25H in response to STING activation may contribute to the homeostasis of the STING signaling. Of note, knockdown of CH25H in B16 melanoma cells enhanced the STING signaling (Supplementary Fig. 14), suggesting the causal link between the STING signaling and CH25H/25-HC.\nH-151, a small-molecule inhibitor that suppresses STING palmitoylation on Cys91, has been developed 38 . Given the success of The P-values (Welch's t-test, both-sided) were less than the significance levels corrected by the Holm-Sidak method. g Scheme of TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of STING in vitro. h TBK1-knockout MEFs were pretreated with (top) 25-HC (30 \u00b5M) for 16 h or (bottom) OSW-1 (0.125 nM) for 6 h, followed by stimulation with DMXAA for 60 min. The membrane fraction of the cells was collected by ultracentrifugation. The resuspended membrane fraction was incubated with cholesterol-methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin complex (chol/M\u03b2CD) or only methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD), followed by incubation with recombinant TBK1 and ATP. Phosphorylation of STING at Ser365 was then analyzed by western blot. i, j Sting -/-MEFs stably expressing mRuby3-STING (magenta), mNeonGreen-iD4H (yellow), and HaloTag7-Rab6 (cyan) were pretreated with (i) 2-BP (200 \u00b5M) for 4 h or (j) H-151 (10 \u00b5M) for 2 h, and then stimulated with DMXAA for 60 min. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with HaloTag SaraFluor 650 T Ligand and with DAPI (blue). k The fluorescence intensity of mNeonGreen-iD4H within the Rab6-positive region in cells observed in (i and j) was quantified.

For HaloTag7 staining before live-cell imaging, cells were cultured in medium containing HaloTag7 ligand at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min in a 5% CO 2 incubator.\n**In vitro assay of recombinant TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of STING**\nCells were collected in an ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 200 mM sucrose) containing protease inhibitors (25955-11, nacalai tesque), and phosphatase inhibitors (8 mM NaF, 12 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1.2 mM Na 2 MoO 4 , 5 \u03bcM cantharidin, and 2 mM imidazole), homogenized with 2 passages through a 27-gauge needle after 6 passages through a 23gauge needle and centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The postnuclear supernatant was overlaid on 10 \u03bcL of 2 M sucrose and centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The membrane fractions were resuspended in a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 200 mM sucrose, 20 mM MgCl 2 , protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors), and incubated with ATP (1 mM) and recombinant TBK1 (100 ng) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and phosphorylation of STING was detected by western blot.\n**Liposome co-sedimentation assay**\nRecombinant mNeonGreen-iD4H protein was expressed in E. coli and purified with Ni-NTA (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol 67 . Lipid mixtures (Dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol) were dried under nitrogen gas and hydrated in buffer A (20 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 mM sucrose, 100 mM KCl, and 1 mM EDTA) for 15 min at room temperature, and vortexed briefly. mNeonGreen-iD4H recombinant protein was diluted with HEPES Buffered Saline, incubated with the liposomes in buffer A for 30 min at 30 \u00b0C. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 25 \u00b0C. The resultant supernatant was collected, and the pellet was washed twice with buffer A. The pellet was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) Staining.\n**Measurement of lipid order using di-4-ANEPPDHQ**\nCells were incubated with di-4-ANEPPDHQ (1 \u00b5g mL -1 ) in DMEM at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min followed by image acquisition. All images for di-4-ANEPPDHQ were acquired on LSM880 (Zeiss) with a 488 nm Ar laser and a 633 nm He-Ne laser line using a 63 \u00d7 1.4 Plan-Apochromat oil immersion lens. di-4-ANEPPDHQ was excited at 488 nm, and the emissions were captured at the following manual bandwidth settings of the spectral detection channel: Ch-L, 505-530 nm; and Ch-H, 675-700 nm. The SaraFluor TM 650 T was excited at 633 nm and detected with the spectral detector at 670-750 nm. di-4-ANEPPDHQ intensity images were converted into generalized polarization (GP) images 41 , with each pixel calculated in Fiji from the two di-4-ANEPPDHQ intensity images according to the equation: GP = (I Ch-L -I Ch-H ) / (I Ch-L + I Ch-H ). GP values in the Golgi area or TBK1 foci were obtained by using binarized images of HaloTag7-Rab6 or TBK1-HaloTag7 generated by Trainable Weka Segmentation, a machine learning tool for microscopy pixel classification in Fiji plugin. GP values in the cytoplasm without plasma membrane were obtained by measuring the mean of GP values in a region 2 \u00b5m inside the cell edge.\n**qRT-PCR**\nTotal RNA was reverse-transcribed by using ReverTraAce qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA Remover (TOYOBO). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using KOD SYBR qPCR (TOYOBO) and LightCycler 96 (Roche). The sequences of the primers were as follows. 5'-AGTGCTGCCGTCATTTTCTGCCTC-3' (mouse Cxcl10; sense primer) and 5'-GCAGGATAGGCTCGCAGGGATGATT-3' (mouse Cxcl10; antisense primer); 5'-AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-3' (mouse Gapdh; sense primer) and 5'-TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-3' (mouse Gapdh; antisense primer). Target gene expression was normalized based on Gapdh content.\n**Lipid analysis**\nCells were collected in an ice-cold buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 200 mM sucrose) containing protease inhibitors (25955-11, nacalai tesque), and phosphatase inhibitors (8 mM NaF, 12 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1.2 mM Na 2 MoO 4 , 5 \u00b5M cantharidin, and 2 mM imidazole), homogenized with 2 passages through a 27-gauge needle after 6 passages through a 23gauge needle, and centrifuged at 3000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The postnuclear supernatant was overlaid on 10 \u00b5L of 2 M sucrose and centrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Total lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method 68 . To detect cholesterol, lipid extracts were subjected to high-performance TLC (Merck) separation with hexane/ diethyl ether/ acetic acid (80:20:1, vol:vol:vol). Cholesterols were stained with a mixture of ferric chloride/sulfuric acid/acetic acid by heating 69 .\n**RNA interference**\nsiRNA specific to Ch25h (Ch25h Stealth Select RNAi) purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Negative control siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. A total of 5 nM siRNA was introduced to cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were further incubated for 72 h for subsequent experiments.\n**Cholesterol add-back experiments**\nCells were incubated with medium containing cholesterol-methyl-\u03b2cyclodextrin complex (Chol/M\u03b2CD) (3.9 mM) for 3 h.\n**Statistical analysis**\nError bars displayed in bar plots throughout this study represent s.e.m. unless otherwise indicated and were calculated from triplicate or quadruplicate samples. In box-and-whisker plots, the box bounds the interquartile range (IQR) divided by the median, and whiskers extend to a maximum of 1.5 \u00d7 IQR beyond the box. The corresponding data points are overlayed on the plots. The data were statistically analyzed by performing one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer post hoc test with KNIME (4.6.3) and R (4.0.2).\nThe number of STING molecules per cluster and the number of STING molecules within 100 nm radius around TBK1 spots were statistically analyzed by performing Welch's t-test (both-sided). In cases requiring multiple statistical tests, the significance level was corrected by the Holm-Sidak method.\nWhen the histogram of colocalization durations was fitted with a single exponential decay function, the 68.3% confidence limit was given as the fitting error for the decay time. The statistical analysis for these distributions was performed using log-rank test (statistical survival analysis). The significance level was corrected by the Holm-Sidak method.\n**Data acquisition of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING or mEos4b-cavin1**\nFor live-cell PALM observation of mEos4b-STING, MEFs were sparsely seeded in a glass-base dish (4 \u00d7 10 3 cells on the glass window of 12 mm in diameter, 0.15-mm-thick glass; Iwaki), and grown in DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 days before each experiment. The data acquisitions of PALM of mEos4b-STING were performed at 37 \u00b0C and at a video rate (33 ms/frame) or 5 ms/frame for 5400 frames with an image size of 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels or 512 \u00d7 512 pixels, respectively, using an Olympus IX-83 inverted microscope (100 \u00d7 1.50 NA oil objective) equipped with a high-speed gate image intensifier (C9016-02MLG; Hamamatsu Photonics) coupled to an sCMOS camera (OCRA-Flash4.0 V2; Hamamatsu Photonics). mEos4b-STING molecules in cells were illuminated with the oblique-angle illumination mode using an activation laser (405 nm, approximately 4 nW/\u00b5m 2 and 20 nW/\u00b5m 2 for observation at 33 ms/frame and 5 ms/frame, respectively) and an excitation laser (561 nm, approximately 7 \u00b5W/\u00b5m 2 and 14 \u00b5W/\u00b5m 2 for observation at 33 ms/frame and 5 ms/frame, respectively). The single-molecule localization precision of mEos4b was 20 \u00b1 1 nm. The final magnifications were 133\u00d7, resulting in pixel sizes of 47.1 nm (square pixels).\nFor live-cell PALM observation of mEos4b-cavin1, PC3 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding mEos4b-cavin1 by 4D-nucleofector (LONZA) and the cells were sparsely seeded in a glass-base dish, and grown in HAM/F12 with 10% FBS for 2 days before observation. The data acquisitions of PALM of mEos4b-cavin1 were performed at 37 \u00b0C and at a video rate (33 ms/frame) with an image size of 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels. Single mEos4b-cavin1 molecules in cells were observed by total internal reflection microscopy.\n**In vitro blinking observation of immobilized mEos4b and analysis**\nFor correction of multiple blinking of mEos4b, we observed in vitro blinking and photoactivation behaviors of purified mEos4b. mEos4b gene was cloned in the pET15b plasmid, transformed in E coli, BL21 (DE3) to overexpress proteins, and mEos4b was purified using a His60 Ni Superflow Cartridge Purification Kit (Clontech), followed by a gelfiltration step using a PD-10 column (Cytiva). The purified mEos4b was diluted to 5 nM in a solution of 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, nacalai tesque) in HBSS (pH = 7.4). Then, 150 \u00b5l of the mEos4b solution was placed in a glass window of the glass base dish and was incubated for 1 h at room temperature to form a uniform thin layer. After washing with HBSS, 1 ml HBSS was added to the dish.\nThe blinking and photoactivation behaviors of mEos4b molecules were observed under the same laser illumination condition as that in cells. As shown in Fig. 1b, we observed single mEos4b molecule emission trace, and measured the number of times mEos4b blinks <N blink > before a photobleaching event, the fluorescence-on time (T on ) before the molecule goes into the dark state or it photobleaches, the fluorescence-off time (T off ) or the time the molecule spends in the dark state as previously reported 27 . The estimation of these parameters from the obtained images of mEos4b immobilized in PVA was performed by using the GDSC SMLM plugin of ImageJ (Time threshold was set to 2.5 s). The histogram of relationship between <N blink > and the probability was fitted by the predicted geometric distribution;\nwhere h = k d /(k d +k b ) is the probability of transition to the dark state and k d and k b are the rates of transition to the dark and the photobleach states, respectively (Fig. 1d). The histogram of relationship between T on and probability density function (PDF) was fitted with single exponential decay function, providing k b + k d (Fig. 1e). N blink (= k d /k b ) was estimated from these values.\n**Analysis of images obtained by super-resolution microscopy**\nThe detection of the fluorescent spots in the images was performed by using the ThunderSTORM plugin of ImageJ with \"Wavelet filtering\" (B-Spline order = 6 and B-Spline scale = 6.0) and the \"Local maximum method\" (Peak intensity threshold = 30-50 and Connectivity = 8neighborhood). After spot detection, the post-processing steps of \"Remove duplications\" (Distance threshold = uncertainty) and \"Drift correction\" (cross-correlation with 5 bins) were further performed. Several methods for PALM image segmentation have been proposed, but which method is the most appropriate is under debate and depends on characteristics of the objects of observation such as molecular density, cluster size, and the ratio of molecules in clusters to those in bulk phase, etc 32 . For example, a pair-correlation method identifies molecular interactions inside clusters by analyzing distance correlation between localizations, but this method does not give us the number and position of clusters, and can be applied only to small clusters of relatively homogenous sizes. Density based spatial clustering analysis with noise (DBSCAN), which allows the classification of molecules in clusters, is known to be sensitive to background noise and difficult to parameterize experimentally. In the present study, we employed two kinds of ways for the image segmentation to detect mEos4b-STING clusters, kernel density estimation (KDE) and SR-Tesseler. In these methods, image segmentation is performed directly from the localization coordinates, which is applicable for the analysis of clusters of heterogenous size, and insensitive to background noise. Furthermore, these methods can be applicable to a wide range of the objects of observation 32 . SR-Tessler 34 is one of the most frequently used methods for PALM image segmentation. Meanwhile, KDE 31,70 is a traditional image segmentation method and can rapidly determine the criterion for segmenting PLAM images as reported previously 71 and described below. KDE provides a way to interpolate object boundaries without bias by the random fluctuations of activated boundary fluorophores. In this study, the binarized PALM images of STING clusters were used for estimation of the residency time of single-molecules of TBK1-HaloTag7 inside the STING clusters upon stimulation (Fig. 8d,e).\nThe datasets obtained by Thunderstorm were imported to the KDE software (MATLAB) for the cluster analysis and the image reconstruction. We used not only localization coordinates, but also uncertainty outputted by Thunderstorm, which represents the degree of spatial precision of the spot. Let x i ,y i , and u i ,i = 1,2, \u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1 ,N be the horizontal and vertical localization coordinates and uncertainty of spot i, respectively. N represents the total number of spots. Considering the uncertainty of the location measurement of spot i, it is considered that the existence probability p i x,y \u00f0 \u00de of the spot i spreads to the Gaussian distribution with the center coordinate x i ,y i and the standard deviation (S.D.) that is proportional to the uncertainty u i as follows:\nin which, A is the proportional coefficient of S.D. to the uncertainty u i ; that is estimated as A\u22486 by some preliminary experiments. Gaussian distribution constructing each existence probability p i x,y \u00f0 \u00de is called Gaussian kernel. The existence probability distribution for all spots, i.e., the PALM image is obtained by the average of the existence probability distribution p i x,y \u00f0 \u00de as\nexcluding spots having extremely small or large uncertainty u i because such spots are likely to be noise. It can be considered that clusters exist where the PALM image, which represents the cluster existence probability distribution, takes above a certain threshold value \u03b8 because the spots appear uniformly inside the clusters with a certain probability. It is necessary to appropriately determine the optimal threshold value \u03b8 for each obtained PALM image because the optimal value differs depending on the target molecule and the experimental environments. In general, the histogram of p\u00f0x,y\u00de values for all x,y forms a bimodal shape consisting of both larger values created by dense spots appeared in clusters and smaller values created by sporadic noise. Therefore, the threshold value \u03b8 should be determined so as to separate these two clusters. Otsu's method is well known as a method for determining such a threshold value 72 . Let S in and S out be sets of coordinates \u00f0x,y\u00de where p\u00f0x,y\u00de \u2265 \u03b8 and p x,y \u00f0 \u00de<\u03b8, respectively. The sets S in and S out mean the inside and outside of clusters, respectively. The number of elements of the sets S in and S out are respectively represented by N in and N out . The intra-class variances of the sets S in and S out are calculated by\nThe average of these intra-class variances is\nThe Otsu's method determines the optimal threshold value \u03b8 so as to minimize the average of the intra-class variances \u03c3 2 S in ,S out \u00c2 \u00c3 as follows:\nIn this study, the clusters are determined using the above Otsu's method.\nAlternatively, the dataset obtained by Thunderstorm was also imported to the SR-Tesseler software for the cluster analysis and image reconstruction 34 . Cluster contour detection was performed by using a Voronoi polygon density factor of 2 without correction of blinking and multi-ON frame detections by the\"Detection cleaner\" function (within the whole ROI).\nMultiple blinking effects were corrected by two methods. One of them is the most commonly used method to merge events that appear close in space and time which is referred to as dark-time thresholding (DTT) 27 . To estimate the numbers of mEos4b-STING in clusters, the numbers of localizations in clusters obtained by the KDE or SR-Tesseler method were divided by 1 + <N blink > , which is the number of localizations per one mEos4b molecule (2.7 for observation at 33 ms/ frame and 2.9 for observation at 5 ms/frame observation). The previous study demonstrated 27 that this method accomplishes unbiased counting of molecules in clusters.\nDTT has been most commonly used for the correction of multiple-blinking, but we need to assume that the blinking behaviors of isolated mEos4b are maintained also in cells. Therefore, to validate the STING numbers per cluster, we also corrected multiple-blinking artifacts by another method, using the PALM dataset and the parameters of a realistic model of fluorescent protein photophysics, which was recently reported and referred to as model-based correction (MBC) 35 . MBC requires neither user input nor additional calibration data.\nUsing two methods of PALM image segmentation (KDE and SR-Tesseler) and two methods of multiple-blinking correction (division by 1 + <N blink > and MBC), we estimated averaged numbers of mEos4b-STING in clusters by three ways. Namely, we performed PALM image segmentation and multiple-blinking correction in the following three ways; (1) The number of localizations segmented by KDE was divided by 1 + <N blink > , (2) The number of localizations segmented by SR-Tesseller was divided by 1 + <N blink > , (3) mEos4b-STING spots corrected by MBC was segmented by SR-Tessler.\nSimultaneous dual-color observation of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING and dSTORM of GM130-HaloTag7, TGN38-Halo-Tag7, TfnR-HaloTag7 or HaloTag7-Rab11 and coordinate-based colocalization analysis of PALM and dSTORM data Simultaneous data acquisitions of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING and dSTORM of GM130-HaloTag7 (a CGN protein), TGN38-HaloTag7 (a TGN protein), TfnR-HaloTag7 (an endosome protein) or HaloTag7-Rab11 (an endosome protein) were performed at 5 ms resolution and at 37 \u00b0C. The data acquisition of PALM of mEos4b-STING was performed as described in the method section of \"Data acquisition of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING\". For live-cell dSTORM of GM130-HaloTag7, TGN38-HaloTag7, TfnR-HaloTag7 or HaloTag7-Rab11, these molecules expressed in cells and labeled with SaraFluor650B (SF650B) were illuminated with the oblique-angle illumination mode using an excitation laser (647 nm, approximately 16 \u00b5W/\u00b5m 2 ). In the excitation arm, a multiple-band mirror (ZT405/488/561/647rpc, Chroma) was employed. The two-color fluorescence images of mEos4b and SF650B were separated into the two detection arms of the microscope by a dichroic mirror (Chroma: ZT561rdc-xr-UF2 or ZT647rdc-UF2). The detection arms were equipped with band-pass filters of FF01-600/37-25 (Semrock) or ET700/75 (Chroma), and the data acquisitions of PALM/dSTROM were performed at 5 ms/frame with an image size of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels, using two high-speed gate image intensifiers (C9016-02MLG; Hamamatsu Photonics) coupled to two sCMOS cameras (OCRA-Flash4.0 V2; Hamamatsu Photonics). The superimposition of images in different colors obtained by two separate cameras was performed as reported previously 73 .\nTo quantitatively analyze the degree of colocalization between mEos4b-STING and GM130-HaloTag7-SF650B, TGN38-HaloTag7-SF650B, TfnR-HaloTag7-SF650B, or SF650B-HaloTag7-Rab11, we performed coordinate-based colocalization (CBC) analysis of PLAM and dSTORM data according to ref. 36. with modification. Briefly, to estimate CBC values, for each molecule of protein A, the number of localizations of protein A (mEos4b-STING) and protein B (GM130-HaloTag7-SF650B, TGN38-HaloTag7-SF650B, TfnR-HaloTag7-SF650B, or SF650B-HaloTag7-Rab11) within circles of the increasing radius was calculated, respectively, providing the density gradients of localizations of protein A and protein B around this molecule.\nHere, N Ai,A (r) is the number of localization of protein A within the distance r around protein Ai, and N Ai,B (r) is the number of localization of protein B within the distance r around Ai. Then, these density gradients were corrected for the area (\u03c0r 2 ), normalized by the number of localizations within the largest observed distance R max and divided by the largest area for protein A (\n) and protein B (\nNamely, the density gradients were corrected by the density at the maximum radius respectively for protein A and protein B. R max and dR (the bin of radius for analysis) were set at 500 nm and 50 nm, respectively, and if both the number of localizations of protein A and that of protein B were less than 50 (= R max dR \u00d7 5) in a circle with R max , CBC values were not calculated because the density gradients cannot be accurately calculated. A uniform distribution gives an expected value of D(r) = 1 for all r.\nThe two distributions were compared by calculating a rank correlation coefficient (Spearman), in which the colocalization coefficient was weighted by a value proportional to the distance to the nearest neighbor to avoid long-distance effects 36 . (anti-colocalized or segregated), through 0 (no colocalization), to +1 (totally colocalized). Furthermore, C Bi was also calculated as well. The summation of C Ai and C Bi in the bins between 0.7 and 1 was used as an index for the colocalization. For control analysis, dSTORM images of GM130-HaloTag7-SF650B, TGN38-HaloTag7-SF650B, TfnR-HaloTag7-SF650B, or SF650B-HaloTag7-Rab11 were rotated by 180\u00b0and overlapped with PALM images of mEos4b-STING and the CBC scores were estimated.\nSimultaneous live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING, to visualize STING clusters and single-molecule imaging of TBK1-HaloTag7, to track their recruitment to STING clusters, and estimation of the residency lifetimes of TBK1-HaloTag7 inside the STING cluster\nSimultaneous data acquisitions of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING and single-molecule tracking of TBK1-HaloTag7 labeled with Sara-Fluor650T (SF650T) were performed at 37 \u00b0C. The data acquisition of PALM of mEos4b-STING was performed as described in the method section of \"Data acquisition of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING\". Single-molecules of SF650T bound to TBK1-HaloTag7 were illuminated with the oblique-angle illumination mode using a 647 nm laser at 2.0 \u00b5W/\u00b5m 2 . The two-color fluorescence images of mEos4b and SF650T were recorded at 33 ms/frame. Under the conditions, the photobleaching lifetimes for SF650T was 7.3 \u00b1 0.1 s.\nEach individual fluorescent spot in the image was identified and tracked as described previously 74,75 . The superimposition of images in different colors obtained by two separate cameras was performed as reported previously 73 . The PALM image segmentation of mEos4b-STING was performed by KDE and the boundaries of STING clusters were determined by binarizing the STING cluster image as described in the section of \"Analysis of images obtained by super-resolution microscopy\". After binarization, the coordinates of the pixels located at the edges of the STING clusters were defined as the boundary. We measured the periods of trajectories of TBK1-HaloTag7 labeled with SF650T inside the boundary of STING clusters, and estimated the residency lifetimes by fitting the histograms with a single-exponential decay function. For control analysis to measure the lifetimes of nonspecific colocalization, PALM images of mEos4b-STING after DMXAA stimulation were superimposed with images of single-molecules of TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T before the stimulation.\nTo quantitatively evaluate STING densities in the cluster at which TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T molecules were recruited, we estimated the numbers of mEos4b-STING molecules within 100 nm radius around all the recruited TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T spots for all the frames. For control analysis, we generated the pseudo-trajectories by shifting the trajectories of TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T in random directions by random distances. In PALM image, let x(t) and y(t) be the x and y coordinates in the PALM image is defined as x = 1, 2, \u2022\u2022\u2022, N x and y = 1, 2, \u2022\u2022\u2022, N y , respectively. We generated two random natural numbers x 0 and y 0 , both less than or equal to N x and N y , respectively, then use x(t)x(0) + x 0 and y(t) -y(0) + y 0 as the trajectories of the control. In case that any part of the trajectories exceeds the range of x and y coordinates in the PALM image, we regenerate the random numbers and start over the process. Then, we estimated the numbers of mEos4b-STING molecules within 100 nm around the same numbers of randomized TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T spots in silico. Subsequently, we created the histograms of the difference between the numbers of STING molecules around the observed TBK1 spots and the randomized spots in silico, which was normalized by periods and areas of the observations (Fig. 8f, bottom). The reason for choosing 100 nm as the distance around the recruited TBK1 molecules to quantify the number of STING molecules is that shorter distances make analysis more difficult. For example, if we employ 50 nm as the distance, the area the number of STING molecules become one forth and the bars in the histogram of Fig. 8f fluctuate very much and the negative values often appear. It becomes hard to perform the same analysis shown in Fig. 8f.\n**Reporting summary**\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n\nStimulator of interferon genes (STING) is critical for the type I interferon response to pathogen-or self-derived DNA in the cytosol. STING may function as a scaffold to activate TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), but direct cellular evidence remains lacking. Here we show, using single-molecule imaging of STING with enhanced time resolutions down to 5 ms, that STING becomes clustered at the trans-Golgi network (about 20 STING molecules per cluster). The clustering requires STING palmitoylation and the Golgi lipid order defined by cholesterol. Single-molecule imaging of TBK1 reveals that STING clustering enhances the association with TBK1. We thus provide quantitative proof-of-principle for the signaling STING scaffold, reveal the mechanistic role of STING palmitoylation in the STING activation, and resolve the long-standing question of the requirement of STING translocation for triggering the innate immune signaling. The innate immune system is an evolutionary ancient system to fight against invading pathogens 1,2 . It acts as the first line of defense, detecting the virus and bacteria through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and activating intracellular signaling cascades that promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, type I interferons, and other antiviral proteins that all coordinate the elimination of pathogens and infected cells. PRRs include Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors, and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) [3][4][5] . Furthermore, STING (also known as MITA, ERIS, MPYS or TMEM173) [6][7][8][9] has been shown to control a sensing pathway that is essential for the innate immune response against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses. While the STINGmediated dsDNA-sensing signaling pathway is critical for successful protection against infections, dysregulated STING activity leads to the excessive production of inflammatory mediators with detrimental effects on surrounding cells and tissues 10 . Recent studies have revealed the critical role of STING in the pathogenesis of a number of autoinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, such as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) 11,12 , COPA syndrome 13-18 , Parkinson's disease 19 , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 20,21 .\n\n",
