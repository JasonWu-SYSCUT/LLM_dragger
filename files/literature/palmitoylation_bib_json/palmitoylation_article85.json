    "abstract": "As emerging pollutants, antibiotics were widely detected in water bodies and dietary sources. Recently, their obesogenic effects raised serious concerns. So far, it remained unclear whether their obesogenic effects would be influenced by water- and diet-borne exposure routes. In present study, Caenorhabditis elegans, nematodes free-living in air-water interface and feeding on bacteria, were exposed to water- and diet-borne erythromycin antibiotic (ERY). The statuses of the bacterial food, inactivated or alive, were also considered to explore their influences on the effects. Results showed that both water- and diet-borne ERY significantly stimulated body width and triglyceride contents. Moreover, diet-borne ERY's stimulation on the triglyceride levels was greater with alive bacteria than with inactivated bacteria. Biochemical analysis showed that water-borne ERY inhibited the activities of enzymes like adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) in fatty acid beta-oxidation. Meanwhile, diet-borne ERY inhibited the activities of acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) in lipolysis, while it stimulated the activities of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in lipogenesis. Gene expression analysis demonstrated that water-borne ERY with alive bacteria significantly upregulated the expressions of daf-2, daf-16 and nhr-49, without significant influences in other settings. Further investigation demonstrated that ERY interfered with bacterial colonization in the intestine and the permeability of the intestinal barrier. Moreover, ERY decreased total long-chained fatty acids (LCFAs) in bacteria and nematodes, while it decreased total short-chained fatty acids (SCFAs) in bacteria but increased them in nematodes. Collectively, the present study demonstrated the differences between water- and diet-borne ERY's obesogenic effects, and highlighted the involvement of insulin and nhr-49 signaling pathways, SCFAs metabolism and also the interaction between intestinal bacteria and the host.\n"
