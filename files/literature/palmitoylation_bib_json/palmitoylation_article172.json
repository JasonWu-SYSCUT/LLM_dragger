    "abstract": "To investigate the role of S-palmitoylation in pyroptosis following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Myocardial ischemic injury is mainly related to the death of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes. Pyroptosis is a new form of programmed cell death and recently is identified a potential mechanism of cardiomyocyte loss. However, the role of S-palmitoylation in pyroptosis following MI remains elusive. AMI was mimicked by permanent left anterior descending artery ligation. The palmitoylated proteins labeled by Click-iT palmitic acid were precipitated using streptavidin magnetic bead conjugate. The short-term palmitic acid dietary intake by modified western diet with palm oil for 7 days is compared with modified western diet with olive oil. Palmitoylation is increased in myocardial infarction and anoxic cardiomyocytes. Pyroptosis, but not apoptosis and necrosis, is more relevant with palmitoylation in the process of myocardial ischemia injury. The gasdermin D (GSDMD) Cys192 palmitoylation promotes its cytomembrane localization by ZDHHC14. GSDMD Cys192 palmitoylation aggravates in vitro cardiomyocyte pyroptosis. The short-term palmitic acid dietary intake or ML348 deteriorates myocardial pyroptosis, infarct size and cardiac function in AMI mice by GSDMD palmitoylation. Disulfiram antagonizes Cys192 palmitoylation of GSDMD-N-terminal and reduces myocardial pyroptosis and injury in AMI mice. We identifies ZHDDC14 induced palmitoylation as a crucial node for modulating GSDMD-N-terminal cytomembrane localization and establishes Disulfiram targeting GSDMD Cys192 palmitoylation as a potential clinical intervention for myocardial pyroptosis.\n"
