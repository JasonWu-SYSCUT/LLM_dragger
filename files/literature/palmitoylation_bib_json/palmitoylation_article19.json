    "abstract": "Structural characterization of assemblies in solutions is essential for understanding the relationship between the structure and material properties. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to investigate amphiphilic self-assemblies in solutions using the phospholipid molecule 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Lyso PC) as a (31)P NMR probe. The high natural abundance and gyromagnetic ratio of (31)P make it one of the most sensitive nuclei in the low-frequency region, enabling efficient detection even in dilute solutions. Lyso PC can readily co-assemble with amphiphilic molecules and ions in aqueous solutions, forming various structures, such as hexagonal, lamellar, and micellar assemblies. The characteristic line shapes of these assemblies reflect the chemical environment around the probe and provide insights into the different phase states of the assemblies. This strategy offers a simple, cost-effective, and static method for obtaining structural information about various assemblies. Our work not only introduces a sensitive probe for characterizing assemblies in a solvent environment but also inspires new ideas for the development of similar spectroscopic probes.\n"
