    "abstract": "Proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), which modulates inflammatory responses, is elevated in the central nervous system in multiple sclerosis (MS) and in its murine model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In PAR2-null mice, disease severity of EAE is markedly diminished. We therefore tested whether inhibiting PAR2 activation in vivo might be a viable strategy for the treatment of MS. Using the EAE model, we show that a PAR2 antagonist, the pepducin palmitoyl-RSSAMDENSEKKRKSAIK-amide (P2pal-18S), attenuates EAE progression by affecting immune cell function. P2pal-18S treatment markedly diminishes disease severity and reduces demyelination, as well as the infiltration of T-cells and macrophages into the central nervous system. Moreover, P2pal-18S decreases granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) production and T-cell activation in cultured splenocytes and prevents macrophage polarization in vitro. We conclude that PAR2 plays a key role in regulating neuroinflammation in EAE and that PAR2 antagonists represent promising therapeutic agents for treating MS and other neuroinflammatory diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Proteinase-activated receptor-2 modulates inflammatory responses and is increased in multiple sclerosis lesions. We show that the proteinase-activated receptor-2 antagonist palmitoyl-RSSAMDENSEKKRKSAIK-amide reduces disease in the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis by inhibiting T-cell and macrophage activation and infiltration into the central nervous system, making it a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis.\n"
