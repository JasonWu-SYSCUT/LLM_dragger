    "abstract": "AIM: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3) Rs) are intracellular Ca(2+) -release channels with crucial roles in cell function. Current IP(3) R inhibitors suffer from off-target effects and poor selectivity towards the three distinct IP(3) R subtypes. We developed a novel peptide inhibitor of IP(3) Rs and determined its effect on connexin-43 (Cx43) hemichannels, which are co-activated by IP(3) R stimulation. METHODS: IP3RPEP6 was developed by in silico molecular docking studies and characterized by on-nucleus patch-clamp experiments of IP(3) R2 channels and carbachol-induced IP(3) -mediated Ca(2+) responses in IP(3) R1, 2 or 3 expressing cells, triple IP(3) R KO cells and astrocytes. Cx43 hemichannels were studied by patch-clamp and ATP-release approaches, and by inhibition with Gap19 peptide. IP3RPEP6 interactions with IP(3) Rs were verified by co-immunoprecipitation and affinity pull-down assays. RESULTS: IP3RPEP6 concentration-dependently reduced the open probability of IP(3) R2 channels and competitively inhibited IP(3) Rs in an IC(50) order of IP(3) R2 (~3.9 muM) < IP(3) R3 (~4.3 muM) < IP(3) R1 (~9.0 muM), without affecting Cx43 hemichannels or ryanodine receptors. IP3RPEP6 co-immunoprecipitated with IP(3) R2 but not with IP(3) R1; interaction with IP(3) R3 varied between cell types. The IC(50) of IP3RPEP6 inhibition of carbachol-induced Ca(2+) responses decreased with increasing cellular Cx43 expression. Moreover, Gap19-inhibition of Cx43 hemichannels significantly reduced the amplitude of the IP(3) -Ca(2+) responses and strongly increased the EC(50) of these responses. Finally, we identified palmitoyl-8G-IP3RPEP6 as a membrane-permeable IP3RPEP6 version allowing extracellular application of the IP(3) R-inhibiting peptide. CONCLUSION: IP3RPEP6 inhibits IP(3) R2/R3 at concentrations that have limited effects on IP(3) R1. IP(3) R activation triggers hemichannel opening, which strongly affects the amplitude and concentration-dependence of IP(3) -triggered Ca(2+) responses.\n",

IP 3 R activation triggers hemichannel opening, which strongly affects the amplitude and concentration-dependence of IP 3 -triggered Ca 2+ responses.\n**| INTRODUCTION**\nInositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP 3 Rs) are tetrameric Ca 2+ permeable channels primarily located at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). [1][2][3] Numerous physiological processes are controlled by Ca 2+ mediated signaling through IP 3 Rs. 4,5 Mammalian cells express three distinct IP 3 R subtypes, namely IP 3 R1, IP 3 R2 and IP 3 R3, which possess ~70% homology. IP 3 Rs operate at the heart of molecular signaling networks and affect metabolic cellular homeostasis. [6][7][8] However, current understanding of IP 3 R-related diseases remains limited and is hampered by a lack of selective pharmacological tools targeting these receptors.\nEach IP 3 R monomer contains a suppressor region, an IP 3 binding core, a regulatory region, a transmembrane region and a C-terminal region, [9][10][11] organized in a \"mushroom-like\" structure. There are currently no IP 3 R antagonists without side effects. 12,13 Heparin, 14 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), 15 caffeine, 16 and Xestospongins 17 are widely used to inhibit IP 3 -evoked Ca 2+ release, but each of those compounds has shortcomings in terms of selectivity and side effects. 18,19 Starting the search for novel candidate inhibitors based on endogenous protein sequences seems promising, as exemplified by work showing Bcl-2 BH4 domain interaction with the IP 3 R1 ligand-binding site thereby inhibiting channel function. 20 Here, we started from a regulatory mechanism in IP 3 R3 whereby a loop extending from a so-called \"ARM2\" structure between the \u03b1 ARM2 -1 and \u03b1 ARM2 -2 domain binds to the IP 3 -binding site and competitively inhibits IP 3 binding, 21 providing crucial insights into the mechanistic function of IP 3 Rs and subtype-specific regulation of these important Ca 2+ -release channels.\nThe IP 3 -Ca 2+ signaling axis has many cross-points with connexins, for example, intercellular Ca 2+ waves are mediated by IP 3 diffusion through gap junctions (reviewed in Ref. [22]). IP 3 -Ca 2+ signaling furthermore underlies oscillations of the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ) in response to a myriad of trigger conditions (reviewed in Ref. [3]), in which the bell-shaped [Ca 2+ ] i -dependence of IP 3 R channel opening is a crucial factor. [23][24][25] Cx43 hemichannels also have a bell-shaped [Ca 2+ ] i -dependence for their opening, 26 allowing them to contribute to Ca 2+ oscillations by Ca 2+ entry. [26][27][28][29][30] Stimulation of IP 3 R signaling furthermore enhances gap junction coupling 12 but also affects hemichannels, that is, the precursor channels of gap junctions, which are more strongly activated to open in response to IP 3triggered [Ca 2+ ] i elevation than by Ca 2+ entry. 31 Open hemichannels permeate substances below ~1.5 kDa, allowing Ca 2+ and Na +32-36 entry but also the loss of, for example, intracellular ATP 37,38 and IP 3 . 39 Because IP 3 -Ca 2+ signaling strongly activates hemichannel opening, a second aim of the present paper was to determine to what extent Cx43 hemichannel opening contributed to IP 3 -triggered Ca 2+ responses.\nHere, we investigated IP3RPEP6 derived from the ARM2 structure of IP 3 R2 that interacts with the IP 3binding site and competitively inhibits IP 3 binding and subsequent Ca 2+ -channel activation. Our results demonstrate that IP3RPEP6 inhibits activation of IP 3 R2 and IP 3 R3 with more limited effects on IP 3 R1. Activation of IP 3 -Ca 2+ signaling also triggers Cx43 hemichannel \n**| RESULTS**\n**| In silico approaches leading to**\n**IP3RPEP6 as a potential IP 3 R2 antagonist**\nA cryo-EM structure of human IP 3 R3 revealed the presence of a self-binding peptide (SBP) competing with IP 3 for binding to the IP 3 receptor site. 21 This SBP sequence is located at the end of two \u03b1helical arms projecting from the N-terminal domain known as \"ARM2\" of IP 3 R3 (Figure 1A); it occupies the IP 3 -binding site and reduces the sensitivity of IP 3 R3 to IP 3 . 21 Sequence alignment showed that the SBP sequence for IP 3 R2 contained an additional stretch of amino acids absent in IP 3 R1 and partly lacking in IP 3 R3 (Figure 1B). Within the putative SBP sequence of IP 3 R2, we identified a cluster of closely apposed glutamate (Glu, E) residues and delineated several candidate peptides that were tested with PEP-SiteFinder 40,41 for their interaction with a homology model of the human IP 3 R2 protein constructed with Modeller software. 42 Hereby, two peptides emerged with high interaction scores with the IP 3 -binding site of IP 3 R2: IP3RPEP5 (human) and IP3RPEP6 (mouse/rat version) (Figure 1C). Both peptides contained 4 Glu residues on a total of 12 amino acids, organized as two doublets separated by two other residues (double EE motif); IP3RPEP6 was chosen for further characterization.\n**| IP3RPEP6 inhibits IP 3 R2**\n**single-channel opening activity**\nWe tested the effect of IP3RPEP6 on IP 3 R2 single-channel activity using the on-nucleus patch-clamp approach on nuclei isolated from DT40-TKO cells stably expressing mouse IP 3 R2. 43,44 Channel opening was triggered by 1 \u03bcM IP 3 in the presence of 200 nM [Ca 2+ ] i and 5 mM ATP to attain maximal achievable open probability (P o ), and we tested concentration-dependent IP3RPEP6 effects on single IP 3 R2 channel opening activity (Figure 1D). IP3RPEP6 significantly decreased P o and reciprocally extended interburst intervals in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting the mean burst length (Figure 1E,F). IP3RPEP6 inhibited IP 3 R2 single channel activity by stabilizing a long-lived closed state with no influence on the mean open and closed times within bursts (Figure S1). In contrast, a control peptide in which the N-terminal Glu of each Glu doublet in IP3RPEP6 were changed into Ala (further called IP3RPEP6-E2A; Figure 1C) did not inhibit IP 3 R2 single-channel activity (Figure 1D-F).\n**| IP3RPEP6 inhibits carbachol-triggered [Ca 2+ ] i elevation most potently for IP 3 R2 and IP 3 R3**\nTo test IP3RPEP6 for its potential to inhibit IP 3 -induced Ca 2+ signals, we first characterized Ca 2+ responses of HEK-293 cells selectively expressing human IP 3 R1, IP 3 R2 or IP 3 R3. 45,46 We determined concentration-dependent responses of the three cell types to carbachol concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1000 \u03bcM by [Ca 2+ ] i recording in Fluo-4 loaded cells (Figure 2A-F). The [Ca 2+ ] i response amplitude decreased in the order IP 3 R2 > IP 3 R3 > IP 3 R1 (Figure 2A-C). The EC 50 for [Ca 2+ ] i elevation was below 1 \u03bcM for IP 3 R2, ~10 \u03bcM for IP 3 R3 and almost 50 \u03bcM for IP 3 R1 (Figure 2D-F). Ca 2+ responses were absent in HEK-TKO cells in which all three IP 3 receptors were knocked out (Figure S2A). Subsequently, we explored a range of IP3RPEP6 concentrations to inhibit carbachol-induced Ca 2+ responses. Due to the net negative charge, the peptide is poorly membrane-permeable, so we applied in situ electroporation for loading the peptide into the cells [47][48][49] and added dextran-tetramethyl-rhodamine reporter dye (100 \u03bcM) to identify peptide-loaded cells during [Ca 2+ ] i imaging. Intracellular loading efficiency of IP3RPEP6 was ~16% of the concentration applied outside on the electroporation electrode (Figure S3). Figure 2G-I illustrates concentration-dependent IP3RPEP6 inhibition of carbachol-induced Ca 2+ responses in the different HEK-IP 3 R cells, using submaximal carbachol stimulation. The strongest effects were observed for IP 3 R2 and IP 3 R3, with less complete inhibition for IP 3 R1 delivering only ~\u2154 inhibition at high (~100 \u03bcM) concentration (Figure 2G). The IC 50 increased in the order IP 3 R2 (~3.9 \u03bcM) < IP 3 R3 (~4.3 \u03bcM) < IP 3 R1 (~9.0 \u03bcM). Negative Hill slopes were ~3 for IP 3 R2 and R3 and lower for IP 3 R1 (~1.6). The control peptide IP3RPEP6-E2A did not inhibit IP 3 R2-mediated [Ca 2+ ] i responses across a broad range of IP3RPEP6 concentrations (Figures S2B and S4 illustrates IP 3 -evoked Ca 2+ release in permeabilized HEK-IP 3 R2 cells using MagFluo4 ER Ca 2+ recording). Likewise, a peptide in which all 4 Glu residues were replaced by Lys (IP3RPEP6-E4K; Figure 1C) neither inhibited the responses (green datapoint in Figure S2B). The higher IC 50 and smooth Hill slope for IP3RPEP6 inhibition of IP 3 R1 is likely the result of the absence of the double EE motif in the SBP sequence of this receptor (see Figure 1B); in contrast, IP 3 R3 contains the double EE motif but with a larger spatial separation compared to IP 3 R2 (Figure 1B). We further tested IP3RPEP5 (human sequence containing a 'PI' instead of 'AN', see Figure 1B), which inhibited HEK-IP 3 R2 responses with an IC 50 of ~11 \u00b5M and a negative Hill slope of ~1, i.e. less favorable properties compared to IP3RPEP6.\n**| IP3RPEP6 competitively inhibits IP 3 R2**\nTo characterize competition between IP3RPEP6 and IP 3 , we stimulated HEK-IP 3 R2 cells with carbachol (0.1-1000 \u03bcM), measured the associated intracellular elevation of IP 3 and probed the effect of IP3RPEP6 (5 different concentrations in the 10-1000 \u03bcM range) on the induced [Ca 2+ ] i responses. Figure 3A illustrates that increasing concentrations of IP3RPEP6 necessitated larger IP 3 elevation to obtain the same degree of [Ca 2+ ] i increase as observed without the peptide, indicating IP 3 competes with the peptide for access to the IP 3 R ligandbinding domain.\nNext, we performed control experiments on RyRs to test possible IP3RPEP6 effects on this other major ER Ca 2+ -release channel, making use of an inducible RyR2 overexpression HEK cell model 50 (Figure 3B). Application of a high intracellular IP3RPEP6 concentration (~64 \u03bcM, electroporation loaded) had no significant effect on the amplitude and duration of caffeine-induced [Ca 2+ ] i transients in HEK-RyR2 cells (Figure 3C-E).\n**| Carbachol-induced [Ca 2+ ] i responses in HEK cells involve a Cx43 hemichannel contribution**\nCx43 hemichannel opening allows substantial Ca 2+ entry due to the high (220-240 pS) single-channel conductance, providing ~1-1.5 pA Ca 2+ current per hemichannel at -70 mV membrane potential. 32,51 As many cell types show background Cx43 expression, we verified whether carbachol-induced [Ca 2+ ] i changes were affected by (G-I) IP3RPEP6 inhibition was close to complete for IP 3 R2, complete for IP 3 R3 and less so for IP 3 R1 where the curve leveled off at ~1/3 of the control response. IC 50 was lowest for IP 3 R2, slightly higher for IP 3 R3 and much higher for IP 3 R1. Negative Hill slopes were ~3 for IP 3 R2/3 and much lower for IP 3 R1. Data are expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM (N = 3, n = 5). inhibiting Cx43 hemichannels using Gap19, which selectively targets Cx43-based hemichannels without inhibiting Cx43 gap junctions. 52 We first recorded [Ca 2+ ] i responses to carbachol in HEK-WT cells and HEK cells transduced with Cx43. 53 Immunoblot Cx43 staining revealed a clear Cx43 band in HEK-WT, indicating endogenous Cx43 expression; Cx43 protein levels were about fivefold higher in HEK-Cx43 cells (Figure S5A,B). HEK cells furthermore displayed low background expression of Cx45 and were negative for Cx37 and Cx40 (Figures S5C,D). Figure 4A,B illustrate typical [Ca 2+ ] i traces recorded in both cell types, demonstrating larger [Ca 2+ ] i peaks in HEK-Cx43 cells compared to HEK-WT (~37% larger-see Figure 4C,D). The EC 50 was also different, being lower (1.53 \u03bcM) in HEK-Cx43 compared to HEK-WT (2.58 \u03bcM). Strikingly, Gap19 inhibition reduced the [Ca 2+ ] i response amplitude in HEK-Cx43 cells and increased the EC 50 from 1.53 to 6.56 \u03bcM (~4 times increase) and the Hill slope from 0.87 to 1.94 (Figure 4D). A similar effect was observed in HEK-WT, most clearly for the EC 50 that increased from 2.58 to 6.37 \u03bcM (Figure 4C).\n**| IP3RPEP6 inhibition of carbachol-triggered [Ca 2+ ] i responses is modified by the presence of Cx43**\nFigure 4E,F demonstrate that concentration-dependent inhibition by IP3RPEP6 was very different between WT and Cx43 overexpressing cells (submaximal carbachol stimulation, as in Figure 2G-I). In HEK-WT, the IP3RPEP6 inhibition curve had a high IC 50 (7.4 \u03bcM) and a low negative Hill slope (1.3) (Figure 4E), while HEK-Cx43 cells had a lower IC 50 (5.2 \u03bcM) and a very steep negative Hill slope (3.1) (Figure 4F). Because the HEK-WT curve (Figure 4E) appeared similar to the HEK-IP 3 R1 curve (Figure 2G) while the HEK-Cx43 curve (Figure 4F) more closely resembled inhibition as observed for IP 3 R2 and IP 3 R3 (Figure 2H,I), we checked IP 3 R-protein levels in HEK-WT and HEK-Cx43 cells using isoform-selective antibodies. This demonstrated 2.4-fold larger IP 3 R3 protein levels in HEK-Cx43 compared to WT (Figure S6), while there were no significant differences in the protein levels of IP 3 R1 and IP 3 R2. This larger expression of IP 3 R3, \n**| IP3RPEP6 dose-dependently inhibits carbachol-triggered [Ca 2+ ] i elevations in astrocytes isolated from mouse brain**\nAstrocytes highly express Cx43, necessary to sustain spatial K + buffering. 54 We used primary cultures of mouse brain astrocytes to determine the effect of IP3RPEP6 on carbachol-induced [Ca 2+ ] i transients in these endogenously Cx43-expressing cells. Figure S5 illustrates astrocytic Cx43 expression relative to the expression in the other cells used in this study. Carbachol-evoked [Ca 2+ ] i responses were characterized by an EC 50 of 6.09 \u03bcM (Figure 4G). As observed for HEK-Cx43 cells, Gap19 strongly reduced the amplitude of the carbachol-induced [Ca 2+ ] i changes and quadrupled the EC 50 for Ca 2+ response activation from 6.09 to 25.78 \u03bcM, while leaving the Hill slope unaffected (Figure 4G). Figure 4H illustrates the effect of IP3RPEP6 on the astrocytic Ca 2+ responses, which were characterized by an IC 50 of 3.84 \u03bcM and a negative Hill slope of ~3, very similar to the observations in HEK-IP 3 R2 cells (Figure 2H). Astrocytic Ca 2+ responses were completely inhibited by 10 \u03bcM IP3RPEP6 and above (Figure 4H), which differs from the responses in HEK-Cx43 (Figure 4F). Immunoblotting revealed high IP 3 R1 and IP 3 R2 protein levels in astrocytes (Figure S6), in line with previous reports. 55 Thus, in astrocytes expressing both IP 3 R1 and IP 3 R2, inhibition by IP3RPEP6 was complete while IP3RPEP6 inhibition in HEK-IP 3 R1 was incomplete (Figure 2G) and complete in HEK-IP 3 R2 (Figure 2H). Full inhibition by IP3RPEP6 in astrocytes may result from the fact that IP 3 R2 dominates the Ca 2+ responses in these cells. IP 3 R2 is expressed in the astrocytic soma and major branches while IP 3 R1 mainly locates in peri-synaptic extensions therefore having a minor contribution to the global signal. [55][56][57] A further scrutiny of CCh-triggered Ca 2+ responses in astrocytes, HEK-WT and HEK-Cx43 cells is given in Figure S7.\n**| IP3RPEP6 binds to IP 3 R2 in HEK IP 3 R2, HEK Cx43 and brain astrocytes**\nWe determined whether IP3RPEP6 could directly interact with IP 3 Rs, using biotin-conjugated IP3RPEP6 and pulldown assays with Neutravidin-coated beads and lysates prepared from HEK-IP 3 R2, HEK-Cx43 and brain astrocytes. Affinity-purified samples were analyzed via immunoblotting and stained for the three IP 3 R isoforms to assess isoform-specific IP3RPEP6 binding (Figure 5). IP3RPEP6 was able to pull down IP 3 R2 in cell lysates from HEK-IP 3 R2, from HEK-Cx43 and from primary astrocytes (Figure 5B). The observed biotin-IP3RPEP6/IP 3 R2 interaction was specific as non-active biotin-conjugated IP3RPEP6-E4K was unable to pull down IP 3 R2 from lysates. IP3RPEP6 also interacted with IP 3 R3 from HEK-Cx43 cell lysates but with lower efficiency compared to IP 3 R2 (Figure 5C). In astrocyte lysates, no IP 3 R3 could be detected in biotin-IP3RPEP6-pulldown samples, most likely because of the low IP 3 R3-protein levels in these samples. Biotin-IP3RPEP6 failed to pull down IP 3 R1 in lysates from HEK-Cx43 cells and astrocytes (Figure 5A). These IP3RPEP6/IP 3 R-isoform interactions underpin the functional results of isoform-specific IP 3 R inhibition by IP3RPEP6, indicating IP3RPEP6 displays higher affinity for IP 3 R2/3 than for IP 3 R1.\n**| IP3RPEP6 inhibits IP 3 -induced Cx43 hemichannel opening in HeLa cells**\nAs the IP 3 /Ca 2+ -signaling axis is a strong activator of Cx43 hemichannel opening, 31,58,59 we further investigated whether IP3RPEP6 could inhibit IP 3 -triggered hemichannel opening. We used UV-photoactivation of caged-IP 3 and recorded Cx43 hemichannel activity in whole-cell patchclamp experiments on HeLa-Cx43 cells. Hemichannel currents were activated by voltage steps from -30 to +70 mV, which triggered single-channel current activity with a unitary conductance of ~240 pS typical for Cx43 hemichannels (Figure 6A,B). Uncaging IP 3 (caged-IP 3 , 10 \u03bcM in pipette) significantly increased unitary event activity quantified by membrane charge transfer (Q m ), as illustrated in Figure 6C. The increased Cx43 hemichannel activity was reduced to control level by IP3RPEP6 (50 \u03bcM in pipette) without affecting the unitary conductance (Figure 6C). We further characterized concentration-dependent effects of IP3RPEP6 on hemichannel ATP-release from HeLa-Cx43 cells triggered by IP 3 -uncaging/Ca 2+ signaling. IP 3 -triggered ATPrelease was dependent on the concentration of caged-IP 3 loaded by electroporation 47 (Figure 6D) and was inhibited by 5 \u03bcM Xestospongin C (Figure 6E). Moreover, IP3RPEP6 concentration-dependently inhibited ATP-release with an IC 50 of ~8.6 \u03bcM and a negative Hill slope of 2.8 (Figure 6F), while the control peptide IP3RPEP6-E2A had no effect (Figure S2C). \n**| IP3RPEP6 does not affect Cx43 hemichannel opening**\nWe verified whether IP3RPEP6 had intrinsic effects on Cx43 hemichannels using HEK-TKO cells, in which the IP 3 -Ca 2+ signaling axis was silenced (Figure S2A); these cells displayed Cx43 expression slightly (but nonsignificantly) above the level of HEK-IP 3 R1, 2 and 3 (Figure S5). We activated hemichannel opening by challenging the cells with a low Ca 2+ bath solution by addition of 4 mM EGTA to the standard bath solution. [60][61][62] Challenging HEK-TKO cells with low extracellular Ca 2+ triggered extracellular ATP-release that was completely inhibited by 200 \u03bcM extracellular Gap19, demonstrating that ATP-release proceeded via Cx43 hemichannels (Figure 7A). We subsequently found that intracellular IP3RPEP6 (tested up to 300 \u03bcM, electroporation loaded) had no effect on ATP-release, demonstrating that the peptide did not affect hemichannels (Figure 7B).\nWe further used HEK-TKO cells to test 2-APB, known to affect several non-IP 3 receptor targets (Table S1). Figure 7B illustrates that 2-APB inhibited hemichannel ATP responses in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 of ~20.5 \u03bcM. Application of Xestospongin C at the commonly used concentration of 5 \u03bcM showed no significant effects (Figure 7C).\n**| Blocking Cx43 hemichannels with**\n**Gap19 does not affect Ca 2+ responses in HEK IP 3 R2 cells**\nHemichannel opening increases the amplitude of carbachol-induced [Ca 2+ ] i transients (see Gap19 effect in Figure 4D). Therefore, the concentration-dependent effect of IP3RPEP6 on carbachol-induced [Ca 2+ ] i transients (Figure 2G-I) may also be affected by background Cx43 expression and hemichannel opening. To verify this, we   S9A demonstrates a slight but non-significant increase in the IC 50 of IP3RPEP6 in the presence of Gap19 hemichannel block, indicating non-significant contribution of Cx43 hemichannel activity to the responses in these cells.\n**| Extracellularly applied palmitoyl-8G-IP3RPEP6 inhibits IP 3 R2 Ca 2+ responses**\nWe tested N-terminal addition of a palmitoyl group to IP3RPEP6 to facilitate membrane permeability and allow extracellular application. To increase flexibility of the active IP3RPEP6 moiety relative to the palmitate part, we included 8 Gly residues between the peptide and the palmitoyl group yielding palmitoyl-8G-IP3RPEP6. Extracellular application of palmitoyl-8G-IP3RPEP6 provided concentration-dependent inhibition of carbacholinduced [Ca 2+ ] i responses, characterized by an IC 50 of ~30 \u03bcM (1 h peptide incubation). The negative Hill slope was slightly steeper than for IP3RPEP6; maximal inhibition at high concentration was 72% (Figure 7D,E). In contrast, conjugation with the TAT cell-permeation sequence (YGRKKRRQRRR) did not confer any inhibition upon extracellular application (Figure S9B), possibly due to interaction between the positively charged TAT sequence and the negatively charged IP3RPEP6 moiety rendering the peptide inactive.\n**| DISCUSSION**\nCurrently, there are few effective and selective IP 3 R antagonists, 13 with none of them being free of pitfalls. 63 Commonly used IP 3 R antagonists, such as heparin, 2-APB, caffeine and Xestospongins, lack subtype-selectivity and affect other targets 18 (Table S1). For example, 2-APB also blocks gap junctions with IC 50 concentrations depending on the isotype (IC 50 of ~50 \u03bcM for Cx43 while ~3 \u03bcM for the neuronal Cx36). 64 Here, we found 2-APB to inhibit Cx43-based hemichannels with an IC 50 of ~20 \u03bcM (Figure 7B), that is, 2.5-fold lower than for gap junctions. Inspired by the recent identification of a selfbinding sequence in IP 3 R3 (Figure 1A), we conceived and characterized IP3RPEP6 consisting of an IP 3 R2-based sequence that competitively interacts with IP 3 binding to the receptor site. We found the peptide to interact with IP 3 R2 in HEK-IP 3 R2 cells, HEK-Cx43 cells and astrocytes (Figure 5) and with IP 3 R3 in HEK-Cx43 cells. Interaction with IP 3 R1 was absent in both astrocytes and HEK-Cx43 cells, suggesting an IP3RPEP6 interaction order of IP 3 R2 > IP 3 R3 > IP 3 R1. At the single-channel level, IP3RPEP6 concentration-dependently reduced the open probability of IP 3 R2 channels (Figure 1E). At the functional signaling level, IP3RPEP6 inhibition of carbachol-triggered [Ca 2+ ] i responses suggested a potency order of IP 3 R2 \u2248 IP 3 R3 < IP 3 R1. Inhibition of IP 3 R2 and IP 3 R3 was complete while incomplete for IP 3 R1 (Figure 2G-I). At a 5.5 \u03bcM concentration, IP3RPEP6 inhibited IP 3 R1 less than \u2153, IP 3 R2 for \u00be and IP 3 R3 for \u2154 while not affecting RyR2 (Figure 3C-E). With Gap19 hemichannel block, 5.5 \u03bcM IP3RPEP6 gave ~\u2154 inhibition of IP 3 R2 compared to \u00be inhibition without Gap19. This smaller degree of IP3RPEP6 inhibition in the presence of Gap19 is caused by the removal of the hemichannel contribution to the [Ca 2+ ] i response amplitude, making the control responses smaller to start with (and therefore relatively less inhibited). The Gap19 effect-size will depend on the cellular Cx43 expression level (compare Figure 4C with D,G). As IP3RPEP6 inhibition is competitive, the concentration values given above only apply to the carbachol stimulation used here and may vary with IP 3 levels associated with other stimulation protocols.\nOur work demonstrates that IP 3 -signaling enhances opening of hemichannels composed of Cx43, a ubiquitously expressed connexin isotype abundantly present in astrocytes and cardiomyocytes. Cx43 hemichannel opening results in Ca 2+ entry amounting to 1-1.5 pA Ca 2+ current per hemichannel at -70 mV membrane potential, 32 a typical resting potential for astrocytes and cardiomyocytes. In cardiomyocytes, this may increase [Ca 2+ ] i in subplasmalemmal microdomains to the 1-4 \u03bcM range per single open hemichannel. 32 Hemichannel opening also results in the release of ATP, which is known to activate purinergic receptors, inducing Ca 2+ entry and IP 3triggered Ca 2+ release. 27,65 In both cases, Gap19-mediated inhibition of Cx43 hemichannel opening will impact the [Ca 2+ ] i responses as shown here. Consequently, the IC 50 , Hill slope and maximal inhibition properties of IP 3 R inhibitors will be affected by hemichannel contributions to the Ca 2+ signal, which can be verified by recording these pharmacological properties under control conditions and in the presence of Cx43 hemichannel block by Gap19, as demonstrated in Figure 4C,D,G.\nAstrocytes are a major glial brain cell type predominantly expressing IP 3 R1 and IP 3 R2 (Figure S6), 55 with high endogenous Cx43 expression (Figure S5). 66,67 Interestingly, IP3RPEP6 inhibition of astrocytic [Ca 2+ ] i responses (Figure 4H) displayed similar IC 50 and Hill slope properties as for HEK-IP 3 R2 (Figure 2H). Remarkably, IP3RPEP6 inhibition in HEK-IP 3 R1 and HEK-Cx43 was incomplete at high peptide concentrations, while complete in astrocytes expressing IP 3 R1 and Cx43, which may be related to functional dominance of IP 3 R2 in astrocytes, [55][56][57] consistent with its highest affinity for IP 3 among the three distinct IP 3 R isoforms. IP 3 R2 is furthermore important in cellular Ca 2+ waves and oscillations, 68 while IP 3 R1 has not been observed to participate in such dynamic Ca 2+ responses in astrocytes. 69,70 In line with this, astrocytic ER stores seem to be more heterogeneous allowing independent subcompartment release of Ca 2+ . 71 In conclusion, IP3RPEP6 is a novel competitive peptide antagonist of IP 3 R2/3 with limited effects on IP 3 R1 at ~5.5 \u03bcM and submaximal effects on IP 3 R2/3 at 10 \u03bcM associated with half-maximal inhibition of IP 3 R1; its membrane permeable version palmitoyl-8G-IP3RPEP6 requires ~7.5 times higher concentrations for IP 3 R2 inhibition. Importantly, the peptide does not inhibit RyR2 or Cx43 hemichannels. Hemichannels open as a consequence of IP 3 / Ca 2+ signaling and increase the amplitude of the [Ca 2+ ] i responses. Consequently, IP 3 -dependent cellular [Ca 2+ ] i responses should be verified for hemichannel-linked Ca 2+ contributions that modify the amplitude and dynamics of the responses as recently demonstrated for cytokineinduced Ca 2+ oscillations, for example. 72 \n**| MATERIALS AND METHODS**\n**| Chemical reagents**\nCarbachol, caffeine, tetracycline and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Bornem, Belgium). Caged-IP 3 was from Sichem (Bremen, Germany). Fluo-4-AM, Mag-Fluo-4-AM and Pierce\u2122 NeutrAvidin\u2122 Agarose were from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium). IP3RPEP6, its inactive versions IP3RPEP6-E2A and IP3RPEP6-E4K and its membrane-permeable version palmitoyl-8G-IP3RPEP6 were from GenScript Biotech (Netherlands). All peptides were synthesized to a purity >95% by HPLC analysis and correct mass spectrometrycontrolled molecular weight.\n**| Cell culture**\nHEK cells, in which CRISPR/Cas9 was used to delete one or more IP 3 R subtypes (RRID:CVCL_UR28), were generated by Dr. David Yule's laboratory (University of Rochester, NY) 46 and supplied by Kerafast. The HEK (HEK-293) and HEK-Cx43 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium) supplemented with foetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%), 10 U mL -1 penicillin, 10 \u03bcg mL -1 streptomycin (Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium). For tetracyclin-inducible RyR2 expression, we used modified HEK-293 cells kindly provided by Dr. S.R. Wayne Chen. 50 These cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium) supplemented with foetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%), 10 U mL -1 penicillin, 10 \u03bcg mL -1 streptomycin, 0.1 mM minimum Eagle's medium nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium); 1 \u03bcg mL -1 tetracycline was applied 18-24 h before functional assays to induce RyR2 expression. HeLa cells stably transfected with Cx43 were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F-12 (Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium) supplemented with foetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%), 10 U mL -1 penicillin, 10 \u03bcg mL -1 streptomycin (Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium) with additional 1 \u03bcg mL -1 puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium) to ensure a stable Cx43 expression. All cells above were maintained at 37\u00b0C in humidified air with 5% CO 2 , and passaged every 3-4 days.\nDT40 cells lacking all three IP 3 R isoforms (DT40-TKO) (RCB Cat# RCB1467, RRID:CVCL_4634) heterologously expressing IP 3 R2 were used for the on-nucleus patchclamp experiments. 46,73,74 The cells were cultured at 39\u00b0C in humidified air with 5% CO 2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% chicken serum, 2.05 mM l-glutamine, 50 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mg mL -1 G418 sulfate, 100 U mL -1 penicillin and 100 \u03bcg mL -1 streptomycin. RPMI 1640 medium, penicillin/streptomycin, G418 sulfate, 2-mercaptoethanol and chicken serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Foetal bovine serum was from Gemini Bio-products.\n**| Astrocyte isolation**\nAstrocytes were isolated from early postnatal (P3-P4) mouse cortices (C57BL/6) as previously described. 75,76 Dissected cortices were triturated in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium) and then seeded into flasks coated with 0.01% solution poly-l-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) (four cortices per T75 flask). Culture media (DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 U mL -1 penicillin and 10 \u03bcg mL -1 streptomycin) was replaced 4 h after plating and every second day thereafter. After 7 to 8 days, oligodendrocytes formed different layers, and the separation of astrocytes from oligodendrocytes and microglia was achieved by shaking the tissue culture flask on an orbital shaker. Astrocytes were then harvested with trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, Gent, Belgium) and replated in a tissue culture flask.\n**| Peptide modeling and docking**\nA cryo-EM structure of the human type-3 inositol trisphosphate receptor reveals the presence of a self-binding peptide that acts as a competitive antagonist on the IP 3 binding site. 21 A loop extending from ARM2 between the \u03b1 ARM2 -1 and \u03b1 ARM2 -2 domain forms a peptide structure that occupies the IP 3 -binding site and reduces the sensitivity of IP 3 R3 to its physiological agonist IP 3 . Microscale thermophoresis results showed that IP 3 affinity for the N-terminal domain was over sevenfold lower than for the ligand binding domain alone, and confirmed that IP 3 R3 SBP competed against IP 3 binding.\nBased on these data, we predicted the interactions between the human IP 3 R2 and SBP by homology modeling and docking studies. A homology model of human IP 3 R2 was built with Modeller using the following templates: rat IP 3 R1 (PDB code 3JAV by Ref. [10]), rat IP 3 R1 with adenophostin A (6MU1 by Ref. [77]), mouse IP 3 R1 and mouse IP 3 R1 with IP 3 (PDB codes 5XA0 and 5GUG by Ref. [11]). Homology modeling scores (molpdf, DOPE, GA341) and Ramachandran plot analysis were used to assess the model reliability.\n**| On-nucleus patch clamp experiments**\nIsolated nuclei from DT40-TKO cells stably expressing IP 3 R2 were prepared by homogenization as previously described. 43 Single IP 3 R channel potassium currents were measured in the on-nucleus patch clamp configuration using pCLAMP 9 and an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, CA, USA) as previously described. 78 Pipette solution contained 140 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 100 \u03bcM BAPTA, 200 nM free Ca 2+ , 1 \u03bcM IP 3 , 5 mM ATP (pH 7.1). Free [Ca 2+ ] was calculated using Max Chelator software and verified fluorometrically. Traces were consecutive 3 s sweeps recorded at -100 mV, sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz.\n**| Electroporation loading of peptides**\nThe IP3RPEP6 and related peptides used in this study have a limited membrane permeability and were therefore loaded into the cell monolayers by electroporation. We used 50 kHz AC electroporation that causes minimal cell damage/cell death as described before. [47][48][49] Cultures were briefly rinsed by a low-conductive electroporation solution consisting of (in mM) 300 sorbitol, 4.2 KH 2 PO 4 , 10.8 K 2 HPO 4 , 1 MgCl 2 and 2 HEPES, pH 7.2; thereafter the solution was removed leaving a thin layer just covering the cells. A bipolar electrode was positioned above the cells containing a small volume (7-9 \u03bcL) to which the peptides and/or caged IP 3 was added. The intracellular concentration of the peptides was determined from confocal imaging measurements with FITC-labeled peptides. For IP3RPEP6-FITC, the intracellular fluorescence was 16% of the fluorescence measured outside (Figure S3B).\n**| Calcium imaging**\nIntracellular cytoplasmic Ca 2+ was monitored by epifluorescence microscopy and digital imaging using the Ca 2+ -sensitive dye Fluo-4-AM. Cells were loaded with Fluo-4-AM by incubation for 1 h shielded from light at room temperature in HBSS-HEPES containing 10 \u03bcM Fluo-4-AM and Pluronic F-127 (final concentration 0.02%). Cultures were then washed with HBSS-HEPES and left at room temperature for 30 min for de-esterification. Carbachol was applied using a culture dish superfusion system. Images were captured using a Nikon TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a 40\u00d7 oil immersion objective (CFI S Fluor 40\u00d7 oil, NA 1.30, Nikon) and an electron multiplying CCD camera (QuantEM 512SC EM CCD, Photometrics), recorded using Micro-Manager software (version 1.4.22) and analyzed using ImageJ software (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). Calcium changes were expressed as relative fluorescence changes \u0394F/F 0 = (F t -F 0 )/F 0 (F 0 is the fluorescence before stimulation and F t the time-dependent fluorescence signal after stimulation). The \u0394F/F 0 was calculated and analyzed with ImageJ software.\n**| Intracellular quantification of IP 3**\nIntracellular IP 3 was determined using a mouse IP 3 ELISA kit according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Antibodies-online GmbH, Aachen, Germany, Cat no. ABIN6974158).\n4.9 | Caged-IP 3 loading and UV illumination Caged-IP 3 (MW 635 Da) was loaded into the cells by electroporation; loading efficiency was determined by comparing the intracellular versus extracellular fluorescence signal (measured with a Leica TCS-SP8 confocal microscope) from several fluorescent probes including 6-carboxy fluorescein (6-CF, MW 376 Da), IP3RPEP6-FITC (MW 1651 Da) and 3 kDa dextran-FITC (MW 3389 Da), yielding an approximate 20% loading efficiency as concluded from interpolation (Figure S3C). UV illumination in the patchclamp experiments (Figure 6A-C) was done with a 349 nm UV DPSS laser (Explorer, Spectra-Physics) connected to a fibre that was positioned close to the cell. UV illumination for the ATP-release experiments (Figure 6D-F) was done with a 100 W Hg-arc lamp with quartz collector lens and bandpass-filtered at 330 nm (330WB80, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT, USA) and focused to the cell culture dish. In both cases, the energy was adjusted to deliver 5%-10% uncaging of the caged-IP 3 amount loaded into the cells. All experiments were performed on HeLa-Cx43 cells, as HEK-Cx43 cells were found to be more sensitive to UV exposure. Control experiments loaded with vehicle-only showed that UV illumination by itself did not trigger any ATP-release in HeLa-Cx43 cells.\n**| ATP measurements**\nHemichannel ATP-release was measured using a bioluminescent ATP assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Bornem, Belgium, Cat no. FLAAM) in the medium above the cells as previously described. 58 ATP-release was measured directly in the medium above the cells. Briefly, 75 \u03bcL ATP assay mix prepared in HBSS-HEPES (at fivefold dilution) was added to 150 \u03bcL medium above the cells and photon flux was counted (Victor-3, type 1420 multilabel counter, Perkin-Elmer, Brussels, Belgium).\n**| Whole-cell voltage clamp experiments**\nCells were studied under whole-cell voltage-clamp to record membrane currents. HeLa-Cx43 cells were bathed in a recording chamber filled with a modified Krebs-Ringer solution consisting of (in mM): 150 NaCl, 4 CsCl, 2 CaCl 2 , 2 MgCl 2 , 2 pyruvate, 5 glucose and 5 HEPES; pH adjusted to 7.4. The standard whole-cell recording pipette solution was composed of (in mM): 130 CsCl, 10 Na-aspartate, 0.26 CaCl 2 , 1 MgCl 2 , 2 EGTA, 5 tetraethylammonium (TEA)-Cl and 5 HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.2. For the experiments with caged IP 3 and IP3RPEP6, the pipette solution was composed of (in mM): 120 CsCl, 10 Na-aspartate, 1 MgCl 2 , 0.2 EGTA, 10 tetraethylammonium (TEA)-Cl and 5 HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.2. Caged IP 3 and IP3RPEP6 were applied by their inclusion in the whole-cell recording pipette solution.\nSingle channel recordings were performed with an EPC 7 PLUS patch-clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Data were acquired at 4 kHz using a NI USB-6221 data acquisition device from National Instruments (Austin, TX, USA) and WinWCP or WinFluor software (credited to Dr. J. Dempster, Strathclyde Institute). All currents in whole-cell configuration were filtered at 1 kHz (7-pole Bessel filter). Patch pipette resistance was 2-5 M\u03a9; membrane potentials were corrected for liquid junction potentials.\nFor single channel analysis, holding currents were subtracted from the recorded current traces, giving traces that only contained unitary current events. Unitary conductances were calculated from the elementary current transitions \u0394i as: \u03b3 = \u0394i/V m . From these data, we constructed all-point conductance histograms that were fitted by a Gaussian probability density function assuming independent channel opening. Channel activity was quantified from the charge transfer Q m associated with unitary currents; this was done by integrating the unitary current traces over the duration of the voltage step as: Q m = \u0283idt.\n**| Western blot analysis and antibodies**\nWhole cell lysates were prepared by treating confluent cell culture with RIPA buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5.5% \u03b2glycerophosphate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 \u03bcL mL -1 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), 30 \u03bcL mL -1 phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 \u03bcL mL -1 mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting as previously described. 79 Briefly, proteins (10-20 \u03bcg) were separated by NuPAGE 4%-12% Bis/Tris SDS-polyacrylamide gels using MES/SDS-running buffer (Invitrogen) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. After blocking with TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 5% non-fat dry milk powder, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody overnight. Next, membranes were incubated for 1 h with secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (dilution 1:2000 in 0.1% Tween/TBS). Protein detection was performed with Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific; p/a Perbio Science BVBA, Erembodegem, Belgium). Band quantification was done with ImageJ software.\nPrimary antibodies used in this study were: rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx43 (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# C6219, RRID:AB_476857); rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx37 (1:500; Invitrogen Cat# 40-4300, RRID:AB_2533465); rabbit anti-Cx45 (1:100; Abcam Cat# ab70365); rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx40 (1:1000; Bioss Antibodies Cat# BS-1050R, RRID:AB_10857532); rabbit anti-IP 3 R1 generated by Dr. Jan Parys's laboratory (1:1000; Rbt03) 80,81 ; rabbit polyclonal anti-IP 3 R2 (1:1000; Abiocode Cat# R2872-2, RRID:AB_2935642); mouse monoclonal anti-IP 3 R3 (1:1000; BD Biosciences Cat# 610313, RRID:AB_397705); mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH (1:10000; Abcam Cat# ab8245, RRID:AB_2107448); mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich Cat# V9131, RRID:AB_477629). \n**| Biotin-pull-down assays**\nTwo million cells of HEK-IP 3 R2, HEK-Cx43 or astrocytes were plated in 75 cm 2 bottles. Cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer after being confluent. Biotinylated peptides (further referred to as Biotin-IP3RPEP6 and the inactive version as Biotin-IP3RPEP6-E4K), used as bait, were immobilized on neutravidin agarose beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pierce, Erembodegem, Belgium) (30 \u03bcL) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Immobilized peptides and cell lysates were used to perform biotin-pull-down assays as previously described. 82 Briefly, equimolar amounts of Biotin-IP3RPEP6 and Biotin-IP3RPEP6-E4K were incubated at 4\u00b0C with 500 \u03bcg cell lysates in 400 \u03bcL interaction buffer 0.025% NP-40 overnight. The beads were then washed five times with interaction buffer. The peptide-protein complexes were eluted in 30 \u03bcL LDS (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Merelbeke, Belgium) supplemented with 1:200 \u03b2mercaptoethanol by boiling for 5 min at 95\u00b0C. Samples were analyzed via western blotting using rabbit anti-IP 3 R1 generated by Dr. Jan Parys's laboratory (1:1000; Rbt03) 80,81 ; rabbit polyclonal anti-IP 3 R2 (1:1000; Abiocode Cat# R2872-2, RRID:AB_2935642); mouse monoclonal anti-IP 3 R3 (1:1000; BD Biosciences Cat# 610313, RRID:AB_397705). Quantifications were performed using the ImageJ software.\n**| Quantification and statistical analysis**\nData are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM. The sample size \"N,\" that is, the number of experimental units, corresponds to the number of independent cell culture dishes used for the experiments. 83 The meaning of \"n\" depends on the type of experiment: for Ca 2+ imaging experiments, it corresponds to the number of different cells recorded from on the day of the experiment for each condition. For ATP-release experiments, it corresponds to the number of replicate wells used on the experimental day. For patch-clamp electrophysiology, it denotes the cells recorded from per experimental day for each condition. For every experimental day, we calculated the average over \"n\" experiments performed on that particular day. 83 Statistical analysis was performed based on the data from all experimental days reported by \"N.\"\nStatistical analysis was done with Prism software (GraphPad 5.0). Two groups were compared with an unpaired Student's t-test and two-tailed p-value depending on the experiment design. Multiple groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Dunnett's multiple comparison test. For analysis of concentration-effect relationships, non-linear curvefitting to a Hill equation was used to provide values for EC 50 (half-maximal effective concentration) or IC 50 (halfmaximal inhibitory concentration). Results were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 ( \u2020 ), p < 0.001 ( \u2021 ) and p < 0.0001 (****), or not significant at p > 0.05 (ns). \n\n\nAim: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP 3 Rs) are intracellular Ca 2+ -release channels with crucial roles in cell function. Current IP 3 R inhibitors suffer from off-target effects and poor selectivity towards the three distinct IP 3 R subtypes.We developed a novel peptide inhibitor of IP 3 Rs and determined its effect on connexin-43 (Cx43) hemichannels, which are co-activated by IP 3 R stimulation.\nK E Y W O R D Sastrocytes, Ca 2+ signaling, connexin-43, hemichannel, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, IP 3 , peptide inhibitoropen probability in a concentration-dependent manner. (A) Domain topology within the human IP 3 R3 monomer, illustrating the ligand-binding domain and the domain containing the self-binding peptide (SBP). Numbers reflect amino acid positions. TMDs, transmembrane domains. (B) Sequence alignment of part of the regulatory ARM2 domain of human type-1, -2 and -3 IP 3 Rs containing the SBP sequence. The \u03b1helical cylinders left and right represent the arms holding the interposed SBP stretch, which is brought in the vicinity of the IP 3 binding site. 21 (C) Peptides used in the present study. (D) Representative IP 3 R2 single-channel recordings from DT40-TKO cells stably expressing IP 3 R2. Channel activity was evoked by 1 \u03bcM IP 3 at 200 nM Ca 2+ and 5 mM ATP in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or in the presence of IP3RPEP6 or IP3RPEP6-E2A at the concentration indicated; C, closed state; O, open state. (E) Pooled data plotted as the P o \u00b1 SEM for the IP 3 R2 current recordings (PBS, N = 5; 1 \u03bcM IP3RPEP6, N = 6; 10 \u03bcM IP3RPEP6, N = 5; 50 \u03bcM IP3RPEP6, N = 3; 50 \u03bcM IP3RPEP6-E2A, N = 6). Statistically significant differences were determined using a one-way ANOVA, with Dunnett's post-test ( \u2020 p < 0.01, ****p < 0.0001 versus PBS control). IP3RPEP6-E2A lacking the two Glu residues had no significant effects. (F) Analysis of IP 3 R2 burst kinetics. Mean burst length constants (solid symbols) and interburst interval time constants (open symbols) are plotted for all conditions. The data indicate that IP3RPEP6 inhibits IP 3 R2 activity by increasing the interburst intervals without altering burst length; IP3RPEP6-E2A did not affect burst/interburst properties.\n\n",
