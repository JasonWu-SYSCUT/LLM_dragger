A large body of studies have revealed that the mechanism of platelet activation depends on the functional changes in integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . 1 The structural characteristics of both the extracellular domain that mediates biological function [5][6][7] and the intracellular domain that induce functional changes [8][9][10][11] were deeply investigated. Recently, Tong et al revealed the importance of an intermediate structure between active and nonactive conformation for platelet adhesion by the use of molecular dynamic (MD) calculations. 12 However, the stability of the structure of the integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 incorporated into the lipid membrane with the nonactive state of extracellular domain still needs to be elucidated.\nRecent progress in computer technology and the evolutions of the force field incorporating quantum mechanics coarse-grained into molecular mechanics such as the CHARMM (Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics) enabled the construction of the biological functions of various proteins from the accumulations of simple physical movements of the atoms. [13][14][15] Various biological functions such as transmembrane water transportation were constructed by structural fluctuations of specific proteins such as aquaporin. 16,17 Specific biological functions of platelets such as adhesion on VWF under high shear stress conditions 18,19 were also simulated from dynamic movements of atoms. 20,21 The MD simulation calculation has also been applied in parts of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 previously 22 and, recently, for whole molecules incorporated into lipid membrane by Tong et al. 12 Several previous studies revealed the important regions within the extracellular domain of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 to achieve its biological functions. 23,24 Moreover, the MD simulation was also applied to the intracellular domain of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . 22 The integrated model of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 constructed from intracellular, transmembrane, and extracellular domain was published recently. 12 Here, we have attempted to confirm the structural fluctuation of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 incorporated into the lipid membrane.\nWe are proposing the hypothesis here that the structure of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 is unstable as compared to other platelet glycoproteins such as GPIba even in the inactive conformation of extracellular domain.\n\n**Material and Methods**\n**Molecular Dynamic Simulation**\n**Initial Structure of GPIIb/IIIa**\nThe initial structure of the extracellular domain of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was obtained from the previously published crystal structure representing the nonactivated conformation. 7,25 While the platelet membrane is known to contain phosphatidyl serine, 26 the cell membrane model composed from lipid bilayer 2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (POPC) 27 was used in this study because the distributions of POPS were shown to be influenced substantially after platelet activation and the precise distributions of POPS before and after platelet activation have only been partly quantified. 28 The structure of the transmembrane and the intracellular domain was adopted from the previously published model predicted from NMR, electron cryo-microscopy, and single particle image reconstruction. 29,30 The POPC membrane model was settled at the transcellular domain of the integrated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 model. The integrated model of whole integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was constructed according to the previously published conceptional model. 30 \n**Molecular Dynamic Simulation Calculation**\nThe water molecules were modeled as CHARMM transferable intermolecular potential with three interaction sites and were arranged around the atoms constructing the integrated model of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 according to the previous publication. 31 Newton's second law of F (force) \u00bc M (mass) \u00c2 A (acceleration) was solved for all atoms constructing the integrated model of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 , lipid membrane, and water molecules. The calculation was conducted using NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics software 20,21 on a computer equipped with four NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs (HPC5000-XSLGPU4TS, HPC systems Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Since biological events occur in stable temperature and pressure, neither constant-temperature, constant-pressure ensemble (NPT) nor constant-temperature, constant-volume ensemble (NVP) ensembles were skipped. The position coordinates and velocity vectors of atoms and water molecules were calculated in each 2.0 femtosecond (10 \u00c015 s) using the CHARMM-36 force field. 32,33 The calculation started immediately from the initial structure. Visual molecular dynamics version 1.9.3 was used for the visualization of the results. 20,21 Root Mean Square Deviations\nIn each calculated structure, the average distances between various atoms excluding lipid bilayer and water molecules were calculated as the root mean square deviations (RMSDs) for all atoms constructing the integrated model of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . To identify the specifically unstable regions within this calculation, the RMSDs were also calculated separately for \u03b1 IIb , in \u03b2 3 , in the intracellular domain, in the transmembrane, and in the extracellular domains . The RMSDs were calculated every 10 picoseconds from the beginning to the end of the calculation.\nThe validity of calculation results was intuitively assessed by comparing the structure of extracellular domain of the integrated model of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 before and after MD calculation. The stability of RMSDs of atoms constructing the extracellular domain of the integrated model of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 within 20\u00d0 objectively confirms that the calculated structure is not extremely different from the crystal structure.\n\n**Results**\n**Initial Structure**\n\u25baFig. 1 shows that the initial structure of the integrated model of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 composed of the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domain arranged within the POPC lipid bilayer. The protein structures are also provided as a pdb file as attached (Supplemental pdb files 1, available in the online version). The transmembrane domain is shown through a lipid bilayer.    \u25baFig. 6 shows the RMSDs in \u03b2 3 within the integrated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 model. Overall, the RMSDs of \u03b2 3 in the integrated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 model apparently stabilized at 15 \u00d0 after 600 ns of calculations. As compared to the extracellular domain, both intracellular and transmembrane domains were more unstable even after 500 ns of calculation.\n**Structure after 700 ns of Molecular Dynamic Calculation**\n\u25baFig. 7 shows the RMSDs in \u03b1 IIb within the integrated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 model. The RMSDs of \u03b1 IIb in the integrated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 model did not stabilize even after 600 ns of calculation. The RMSD in \u03b1 II and extracellular domain were larger than that in their intracellular and transmembrane domains.\n\n**Discussion**\nIntegrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 is one of the most commonly expressed platelet membrane GP. Unlike other commonly expressed pairs of protein complexes such as GPIb/IX, the biological functions of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 change dramatically after platelet activation.\nThe functional changes in integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 upon platelet activation are mediated mostly by the conformational changes in its extracellular domain. 34 Various ions including cations such as calcium and magnesium play important roles in keeping both inactive and active conformation of the extracellular domain of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . [35][36][37] The activated form of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 can bind with ligand proteins such as fibrinogen and VWF although it could not bind them in its inactive form. The mechanisms of intracellular signaling pathways to achieve active conformation of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 have deeply been investigated so far. Recently, the logical link between the structural changes in intracellular domain of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 on the substantial conformational changes in its extra-cellular domain was suggested by combining all-atom simulations, principal component analysis, and mesoscale modeling by Tong et al. 12 Here, the MD simulation of the integrated model of the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domain of the integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 incorporated into the lipid bilayer membrane was conducted in all atoms constructing them. The structure of the integrated model continuously fluctuated even when the calculation was started from the inactive conformation of extracellular domain suggesting the structural instability of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 even at the resting state.\nAs compared to other platelet membrane GPs such as GPIb\u03b1, the integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 model was structurally unstable even with a similar extent of calculation length. Indeed, the RSMD became apparently stable after the initial 200 ns of calculation but continued to fluctuate until 650 ns. The timedependent fluctuation is clearer in the \u03b1 IIb domain than \u03b2 3 . Within \u03b1 IIb , time-dependent fluctuation was clearer in the extracellular domain. For the future, we aim to apply this   model to understand the logical link between the conformational changes in the intracellular domain in integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 induced by increased intracellular calcium ion concentration upon the activation of platelets on the conformational changes in its extracellular domain. 37 Molecular dynamic simulation is not a novel technic. 38 But, recent advances in high-performance computers enabled clarification of the specific biological functions by large-scale and long-time simulation calculation 39 such as water transportation by dynamic structural changes in specific proteins. 40,41 For the platelet membrane protein, the structural fluctuation and biological functions of platelet GPIb\u03b1 binding with the A1 domain of VWF were extensively investigated. 20,21,42 Unlike the integrated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 model, RMSD of GPIb\u03b1 binding with VWF converged to approximately 2 \u00c5 and stabilized after several hundred nanoseconds of calculation. As compared to GPIb\u03b1, the structure of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was apparently unstable as shown by the attached movies. Our MD calculation results are in agreement with the previous publication. 12 The substantial difference in the stability of the structure in commonly present platelet membrane GPIb\u03b1 and GPIIb/IIIa of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 is suggested.\nPlatelet activation initiated by various receptor stimulations rapidly increases the intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca 2\u00fe ] i ). The activation-dependent changes in the structure of the extracellular domain of the integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 occur subsequently to this. It is of note that active conformation of the extracellular domain of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 rapidly reversed to the inactive state without continuous stimulation of the P2Y 12 ADP receptor that is necessary for the cyclic increase in [Ca 2\u00fe ] I . 37,43 These experimental findings suggest that the changes in the structure of the extracellular domain of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 are reversible events. Yet, the precise mechanism is still to be elucidated. Our computer simulation calculation findings that the structure of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 in nature is not as stable as other membranous proteins such as GPIb\u03b1 do not contradict with these previous findings. Various intracellular proteins such as talin 8,44,45 and kindlin 11 play a role in achieving and maintaining the active conformation of the extracellular domain of \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . The dynamic structural regulation process should be controlled by a cyclic increase in [Ca 2\u00fe ] i . Most likely, these intracellular proteins cause structural change in intracellular domain of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . Our integrated model of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 started from the inactive conformation of extra-cellular domain. We have shown here the structural fluctuation of our model even within the inactive conformation of extracellular domain. These structural fluctuations may explain the redundant biological function of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 including its binding capacity to bind to fibrinogen with RGD (arginine-glycine-aspartate) and NGD (asparagine-glycine-arginine) peptides. 46 In the future, we are aiming to test the hypothesis whether the conformation of extra-cellular domain becomes an active form by modifying the structure of intracellular domain mimicking platelet activation.\nThere are several clear limitations in our study. We have adopted the previously published crystal structure of the inactive form of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 47 as the extracellular domain of our integrated model of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 . However, the crystal structure may not be identical to the functional structure of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 in the human body. Moreover, the structure of transmembrane and intracellular domain was adopted from the prediction from NMR, electron cryo-microscopy, and single particle image reconstruction. 29,30 The precise structure of the transmembrane domain, especially \u03b1 IIb integrin was hard to be determined in a biochemical manner. 48 MD simulation revealed positional fluctuations of amino acids in integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 as shown in the attached Supplemental movie 1 and movie 2 (available in the online version). The results shown in the figures in this paper only reflect the snapshot of the fluctuating structure. Accordingly, we are not aiming to provide a new structural model as compared to the previously established ones. 49,50 Our goal in this paper is to show the persisting structural fluctuation of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 even after convergence of MD calculation starting from inactive extracellular conformation. The use of the lipid membrane composed only from POPC without POPS may also influence the experimental results. Biological experiments revealed that the position of POPS changed from the inside to the outside of the platelet membrane. 51 However, the precise location of POPS in the membrane is still to be elucidated. While the initial structure did not contradict with previously published findings, 48,52,53 one may argue that our model was artificially developed even though we followed the previous publication to construct the integrated model. 29,30 To quantify the structural fluctuations of atoms constructing \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 , the RMSDs were calculated in our study. However, the RMSD values may be influenced by errors such as inappropriate selection of initial structures. 54 The highest value of RMSD shown in extracellular domain of \u03b1 IIb may reflect the largest structural difference between the initial and calculated structure in the extracellular domain of \u03b1 IIb. Despite these limitations, our major findings showing fluctuations even after the convergence of the integrated model is not influenced.\nThe Supplemental Movie 1\nTime-dependent change in the structure of the integrated model of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 in frontal view excluding the water and lipid molecules.

Molecular dynamic simulation calculation on our model suggests persisting structural fluctuation of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 with inactive extracellular conformation incorporated into lipid membrane even after the convergence of MDs calculations.\nWhat is Known on this Topic? What Does this Paper Add?\n\u2022 The integrated model of platelet integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 (platelet membrane glycoprotein: GPIIb-IIIa) constructed from intracellular, transmembrane, and extracellular domain suggested structural instability of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 even in the inactive conformation of extracellular domain. \u2022 Our calculation results are in agreement with previous publication but still provide hypothesis to be tested in the future.\n\n\nBackground The structure and functions of the extracellular domain of platelet integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 (platelet membrane glycoprotein: GPIIb-IIIa) change substantially upon platelet activation. However, the stability of the integrated model of extracellular/ transmembrane/intracellular domains of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 with the inactive state of the extracellular domain has not been clarified. Methods The integrated model of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 was developed by combining the extracellular domain adopted from the crystal structure and the transmembrane and intracellular domain obtained by Nuclear Magnetic Resonace (NMR). The transmembrane domain was settled into the phosphatidylcholine (2-oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (POPC)) lipid bilayer model. The position coordinates and velocity vectors of all atoms and water molecules around them were calculated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation with the use of Chemistry at Harvard Macromolecular Mechanics force field in every 2 \u00c2 10 \u00c015 seconds.\nResultsThe root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of atoms constructing the integrated \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 model apparently stabilized at approximately 23 \u00d0 after 200 ns of calculation. However, minor fluctuation persisted during the entire calculation period of 650 ns. The RMSDs of both \u03b1 IIb and \u03b2 3 showed similar trends before 200 ns. The RMSD of \u03b2 3 apparently stabilized approximately at 15 \u00d0 at 400 ns with persisting minor fluctuation afterward, while the structural fluctuation in \u03b1 IIb persisted throughout the 650 ns calculation period. Conclusion In conclusion, the integrated model of the intracellular, transmembrane, and extracellular domain of integrin \u03b1 IIb \u03b2 3 suggested persisting fluctuation even after convergence of MD calculation.\n\n",
