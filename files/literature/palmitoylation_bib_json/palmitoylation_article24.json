    "abstract": "Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) are the main component cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and play a crucial role in responding to viral infections to prevent the central nervous system (CNS) from viral invasion. Interferon-inducible transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) is a multifunctional membrane protein downstream of type-I interferon. In this study, we discovered that hIFITM1 expression was highly upregulated in hBMECs during Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. Depletion of hIFITM1 with CRISPR/Cas9 in hBMECs enhanced JEV replication, while overexpression of hIFITM1 restricted the viruses. Additionally, overexpression of hIFITM1 promoted the monolayer formation of hBMECs with a better integrity and a higher transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), and reduced the penetration of JEV across the BBB. However, the function of hIFITM1 is governed by palmitoylation. Mutations of palmitoylation residues in conserved CD225 domain of hIFITM1 impaired its antiviral capacity. Moreover, mutants retained hIFITM1 in the cytoplasm and lessened its interaction with tight junction protein Occludin. Taken together, palmitoylation of hIFITM1 is essential for its antiviral activity in hBMECs, and more notably, for the maintenance of BBB homeostasis.\n"
