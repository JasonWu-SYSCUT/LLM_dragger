    "abstract": "The impact of nanoplastics (NPs) on environmental pollution and aquatic organisms has gradually attracted attention, but there are relatively few reports of the effects of NPs on the lipid metabolism of crustaceans. In this study, we exposed Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) to different concentrations of polystyrene NPs (0, 0.1, 1, 5, and 10 mg/L) for 28 days. We then evaluated the effects of NP exposure on metabolite content, histology, lipid metabolism-related enzyme activity, and gene expression. Our results showed that with increasing NPs concentrations and exposure time, (1) the crude protein and crude fat content decreased and fatty acid composition changed; (2) the tissue structure was destroyed and the number of lipid droplets increased in the hepatopancreas; (3) the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, pyruvate kinase and low-density lipoprotein content tended to decrease and that of lipase and high-density lipoprotein content first increased and then decreased; the content of triglycerides and total carbohydrate first decreased and then increased; (4) the expression of fatty acid synthesis-related genes (Fas, SREBP, and FAD), fatty acid transport-related genes (FATP, FABP, and ACBP), and fatty acid decomposition-related genes (Ampk and lip1) first increased and then decreased. These results indicate that exposure to NPs can cause physiological disorders of fat metabolism in L.vannamei and that high concentrations of NPs have a negative impact on lipid metabolism. These results of this study provide valuable ecotoxicological data for better interpretation of the mechanism of action of NPs in crustaceans.\n"
