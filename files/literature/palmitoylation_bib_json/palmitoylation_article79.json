    "abstract": "Soluble alpha-amylases play an important role in the catabolism of polysaccharides. In this work, we show that the malt alpha -amylase can interact with the lipid membrane and further alter its mechanical properties. Vesicle fluctuation spectroscopy is used for quantitative measurement of the membrane bending rigidity of phosphatidylcholines lipid vesicles from the shape fluctuation based on the whole contour of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs). The bending rigidity of the 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid vesicles in water increases significantly with the presence of 0.14 micromolar alpha-amylase (AA) in the exterior solution. It appears that the enzyme present in the external solution interacts with the outer layer of the bilayer membrane, leading to an asymmetry of the solution on either side of the bilayer membrane and altering its elasticity. At AA concentration of 1.5 micromolars and above, changes in the morphology of the GUV membrane are observed. The interaction between AA in the external solution and the external leaflet causes the bilayer membrane to curve spontaneously, leading to the formation of outbuds, giving a positive spontaneous curvature of C(0) </= 0.05 mum(-1) at approximately 1 mg / ml of the AA concentration. We validate and characterize its concentration-dependent role in stabilizing the membrane curvature. Our findings indicate that the involvement of the enzyme, depending on the concentration, can have a considerable effect on the mechanical characteristics of the membrane.\n"
