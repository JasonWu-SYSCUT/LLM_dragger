    "fullText": "**| INTRODUCTION**\nS-palmitoylation (hereafter named palmitoylation) is the only reversible lipid-modification, circulating between protein palmitoylation, catalyzed by palmitoyltransferases, that is, ZDHHCs, and protein depalmitoylation, catalyzed by palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (e.g., PPT1/2, APT1/2, and ABHD17s). 1,2 In general, dynamic protein palmitoylation may be involved in regulating protein subcellular localization, protein-protein interaction, and signaling transduction and so forth. and therefore participates in modulating diversified cellular and physiological functions. [3][4][5] Previously, it was reported that Sept8-204, a transcript of Sept8 that is exclusively expressed in neuron, is modified by palmitoylation both in vitro and in vivo, 6,7 yet, many aspects of Sept8-204 palmitoylation at molecular and cellular levels remain largely unknown and invite further investigations.\nSeptin8 (Sept8) and Septin5 (Sept5) belong to Septin family, which are highly conserved GTP-binding proteins. 8,9 Both Sept8 and Sept5 are enriched in presynapses and participate in the regulation of synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking and neurotransmitter release via possibly forming a complex with syntaxin1A. 10,11 Moreover, it was reported that Sept5, vesicle-associated membrane protein2 (VAMP2) and syntaxin1A are binding partners of Sept8, [12][13][14] which then regulates the interaction between VAMP2 and synaptophysin (SYP), and inhibits SNARE complex formation. 12 Interestingly, Sept8 has two mainly transcriptional variants (Sept8-201 and Sept8-204) expressed in mouse brain, and the coexpression of Sept8 and Sept5 could induce the formation of vesicle-like structure ex vivo. 15 Considering that Sept8-204 is palmitoylated protein uniquely expressed in CNS, we thought to understand whether palmitoylation is required for the formation of vesiclelike structure and may relate to neuronal function and the firing of action potentials.\nHere, we showed that protein palmitoylation is required for Sept8-204/Sept5 to maintain small sized vesicle-like structure and colocalize with SYP, while Sept8-201/Sept5 produces large puncta, which barely colocalizes with SYP. Most importantly, reversible Sept8-204 palmitoylation controlled by ZDHHC17 and PPT1 dynamically modulates the size of vesicle-like structure, which may suggest their potential physiological functions in neural cells.\n\n**| METHODS**\n**| Regents, antibodies and plasmids**\nCell treated with the following regent for different does.

The cDNA sequences of Sept8-204 and Sept8-201 were cloned into pCMV3 vector with Flag or GFP tag on the N-terminal. The cDNA sequences of Sept5, ZDHHC17 and PPT1 were cloned into pCMV3 vector with Ha tag on the C-terminal. The cDNA sequences of SYP were cloned into pCMV3 vector with OFP at the N-terminal. The cDNA sequences of Rab5 and Lamp1 were cloned into pCMV3 vector with RFP at the N-terminal. The cDNA sequences of LC3 were cloned into pCMV3 vector with mCherry at the N-terminal.\n**| N2a cells cultures and transfection**\nN2a cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone, SH30024.01), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin (HyClone, SV30010). When the cell fusion reached 70%, DNA were transfected with lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, L3000-015) following the instructions. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 incubator for 24 h.\n**| Generation of zdhhc17-KO N2a cells**\nIn brief, Cas9 mRNA and gRNA (gRNA1: GTTGTA-CAACCATGGATAAA TGG and gRNA2: GCAGACCC CTCCTTAATTGA TGG) were mixed by in-vitro transcript kits, and transfected into N2a cells. The transfected cells were screened by flow cytometry. The following primers (F: CTCCTCAAGTCTGCGCTTTC and R: ACG-CACACTATTGAGAGTTCC) were used for genotyping purpose. ZDHHC17 antibody (ab154054) was used to analyze ZDHHC17 expression in knockout cells.\n**| Animals**\nWild-type C57BL6 (B6) mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. Mice were housed in SPF environment at 25\u00b0C with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with access to food and water. All animal procedures were performed according to guidelines approved by the committee on animal care at Xinxiang Medical University.\n**| Neuron culture and transfection**\nHippocampal neurons were cultured as described previously with modification. Briefly, mouse hippocampus was isolated from embryos at E19 and kept in cold HBSS (Gibco, 14175). The tissues were washed three times with HBSS and incubated for 15 min with 0.25% trypsin (sigma, SM-2001) at 37\u00b0C. Dissociated cells were suspended in DMEM+++ (5% FBS, 1% Glutamax, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% Pen/Strep) and washed three times with DMEM+++. Neurons were plated at a density of 0.8 \u00d7 10 6 cells/well onto a poly-D-lysine coated 12 well plate on glass coverslips. NBM+++ (Gibco, 21103-049) (2% B27, 1% Glutamax, and 1% Pen/Strep) was used as maintaining media. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, 11668-019) was used for transient transfection according to Lipofectamine 2000: plasmid = 1:1 at DIV 7.\nAs described, 16 cultured neurons (DIV15) expressing Flag-Sept8/Sept5-Ha or Flag-Sept8-3CA/Sept5-Ha were stimulated for 60 s with 55 mM KCl in Krebs'-Ringer's-HEPES solution (KRH, 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO 4 , 1.2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 6 mM glucose, and 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4).\n**| ABE and RAC assay**\nPalmitoylation of Sept8-204 was analyzed by RAC and ABE assay, as previously described. 2,17 Briefly, 1 mg mice brain lysate was used for RAC assay and incubated in blocking buffer (100 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 2.5% SDS, 50 mM NEM, pH 7.5) and kept at 50\u00b0C for 1 h with agitation. NEM was removed by three sequential acetone precipitations. The pellet was resuspended in 600 \u03bcL binding buffer (100 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 7.5) and divided into two equal samples: one samples (+HA) was treated with 40 \u03bcL 2 M hydroxylamine (HA) and one samples (-HA) was treated with 40 \u03bcL 2 M NaCl. Both samples were added with 50 \u03bcL pre-equilibrated thiopropyl Sepharose 6B (Cat#17-0420-01, GE Healthcare). Resins were washed five times with binding buffer and eluted with 40 \u03bcL Leammli loading buffer (2.1% SDS, 66 mM Tris-HCl, 26% (W/V) glycerol, 50 mM DTT, pH 7.5) on a shaker at 42\u00b0C for 15 min and used for WB analysis.\nABE assay was performed using 1 mg mice brain lysate. The protein lysate was incubated with 50 mM NEM in LB buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) overnight at 4\u00b0C. Chloroform-methanol (CM) precipitate samples. The pellet was dissolved in 400 \u03bcL SB buffer (4% SDS, 50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), and divided into two equal parts: +HA sample and -HA sample. +HA sample was diluted with Hydroxylamine (HA) -containing +HA buffer (0.7 M hydroxylamine, 1 mM HPDP-biotin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM PI, 1 \u00d7 PI pH 7.4), while -HA sample was diluted with -HA buffer (50 mM Tris, 1 mM HPDP-biotin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 1 \u00d7 PI, pH 7.4) at 25\u00b0C for 1 h. CM precipitate samples. The sample was incubated with (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM HPDP-biotin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 1 \u00d7 PI, pH 7.4) at 25\u00b0C for 1 h. CM precipitate samples. The pellet was dissolved with 100 \u03bcL TB buffer, 1.9 \u03bcL mL LB buffer and 25 \u03bcL streptavidinagarose at 4\u00b0C for overnight. Agarose was washed using Washing buffer was for six times and eluted by 150 \u03bcL LB buffer containing 1% \u03b2-ME and used for WB analysis.\n**| Click chemistry**\nClikc chemistry was performed as previous described. 18,19 N2a Cells transfected with Flag-Sept8-204 were treated with 50 \u03bcM 17-ODYA (Cayman Chemical, Cat#90270) probe for 8hs, and then cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% TritonX-100, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail. Cell lysates were collected by centrifugation (12000 rpm, 10 min) at 4\u00b0C to remove the debris. Protein concentrations were quantified by BCA assay. For Cu 2+catalyzed click reaction: aliquot (94 \u03bcL) lysates were incubated with 1 \u03bcL of 10 mM biotin-azide stock in DMSO, 2 \u03bcL of 50 mM TECP, 1 \u03bcL of 10 mM TBTA stock in DMSO, 2 \u03bcL of 50 mM CuSO 4 stock in H 2 O at room temperature for 1 h. 0.2 \u03bcL of 10 mM EDTA was added to terminate the reaction. Biotinylated (palmitoylated) proteins were affinity isolated using 25 \u03bcL streptavidin beads at RT for 4 h and analyzed by WB using Flag antibody.\n**| Western blot**\nDifferent ages brain tissue and cultured cells were homogenized in RIPA buffer (Beyotime Biotechnonogy, P0013) containing protein inhibitor (PI). Samples were centrifuged at 12 000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and quantified by BCA kits. Lyates were separately by SDS-PAGE and transferred into nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was immunoblotted with different antibodies and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Data were quantitated by using ImageJ software and GraphPad Prism 8.0.1.\n**| Immunoprecipitation (IP)**\nCells were lysed in RIPA (with PI) and centrifuged at 12 000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant of cell lysates was precleared Flag-agrose (sigma, #SLG8965) overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing five times with 1 \u00d7 TBS, the bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 M glycine\u2022HCl at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting.\n**| Immunocytochemistry**\nIn general, cultured cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at RT. After washed with PBS, cells were permeabilized with 0.01% TritonX-100 for 5 min, washed with PBS, and then blocked with 3% BSA for 1 h, labeled with primary antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with different secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Fluorescent images were acquired with Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscopy with 63 \u00d7 oil-immersion lens. The fluorescence intensity and colocalization rates were measured by Leica software LAS X (version:3.3.0.16799) along the blue lines. Similarly, the longest axis of puncta was calculated as puncta diameter with the same software.\n**| Electrophysiological recordings from cultured neurons**\nPipette (3.8-4.4 m\u03a9) were pulled from borosilicate glass (O.D.: 1.5 mm, I.D.: 0.86 mm, Sutter Instrument) and filled with internal solution containing 40 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na 2 -ATP. Extracellular bath solution contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, 10 mM, and 10 mM glucose. TTX (1 \u03bcM) was added to block action potential for mEPSCs recording. To record excitatory postsynaptic currents, the GABAR antagonist bicuculline (10 \u03bcM) was added in the bath solution just before use. Cells were voltage clamped at -70 mV and all patch-clamp recordings were performed at room temperature. Currents were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), low-pass filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized using a Digidata 1550B interface (Molecular Devices) at 5 kHz. Offline analysis of mEPSCs was performed using Mini analysis software (version: 6. 0. 3).\n**| Statistics and reproducibility**\nAll data were presented as means \u00b1 S.E.M. Statistics analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Paired Student's t test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Significance was defined as: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and n.s., not significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times independently. None of the samples were excluded from the statistical analysis. Sample sizes were chosen based on what is commonly used in the field and were not statistically predicted.\n**| RESULTS**\n**| The coexpression of Sept8 variants with Sept5 result in divergent size of vesicle-like structure**\nTo profile the expression patterns of Sept8 and Sept5, WT mice brains were collected from varied timepoints and the results showed that the protein level of Sept8-204, Sept8-201, or Sept5 gradually increases along with brain development, which is in line with synaptic proteins, such as synaptophysin (SYP), VAMP2, SNAP25, and syntaxi-n1A/1B (Supporting Information S1: Figure 1A,B).\nSept8 has two major variants in mice brain, Sept8-204 (484 aa) and Sept8-201 (429 aa). Previously, it was shown that the coexpression of Sept8 with Sept5 forms vesiclelike structure in mammalian cells, 20 however, it was not clear which variant of Sept8 was used. To test whether Sept8 variants may cause divergent cellular consequence, we constructed Sept8-204 or Sept8-201 with a Flag (DYKDDDDK) tag at the N-terminal, and Sept5 with a Ha (YPYDVPDYA) tag at the C-terminal. Flag-Sept8-204 or Flag-Sept8-201 were coexpressed with Sept5-Ha in N2a cells. Interestingly, the expression of Flag-Sept8-204 with Sept5-Ha produces a similar size of vesicle-like structure as shown before (vesicle diameter approximately 0.25 \u03bcm), 15 while the expression of Sept8-201 with Sept5 produces significantly larger puncta (puncta diameter approximately 1.79 \u03bcm) (Figure 1A,B), confirmed also by 3D scanning images (Figure 1C). Both Flag-Sept8-204 and Flag-Sept8-201 have strong interactions with Sept5-Ha (Figure 1D,E). Most strikingly, the expression of either Flag-Sept8-204, Flag-Sept8-201, or Sept5-Ha alone produces no such structure (Supporting Information S1: Figure 1C), suggesting that the coexpression with Sept5 is essential for the formation of vesicle-like structure. Furthermore, to understand how the large puncta forms, GFP-Sept8-201 (N-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged Sept8-201) was coexpressed with Sept5-RFP (C-terminal red fluorescent proteintagged Sept5) for live cell imaging, and the imaging data showed that Sept8-201/Sept5 initially forms small vesicles, and gradually, they seem able to fuse and become larger puncta (Figure 1F and Supporting Information S2: Video 1).\n**| The palmitoylation of Sept8-204 is required for maintaining the size of puncta**\nPrevious studies suggested that Sept8 is a palmitoylation modified protein in neurons. 6,7 For confirmation, Flag-Sept-204 and its nonpalmitoyl mutant Flag-Sept8-204-3CA (C469A/C470A/C472A) were expressed in N2a cells for ABE, RAC and Click analysis, the results showed that Sept8-204 is readily palmitoylated, while Sept8-204-3CA is not palmitoylation (Figure 2A-D, Supporting Information S1: Figure 2A,B). Moreover, the treatment of 2-BP (palmitoylation inhibitor) decreases (Figure 2E,F), and that of PalmB (depalmitoylation inhibitor) increases (Figure 2G,H), the level of Sept8-204 palmitoylation. To determine whether Sept8-204 palmitoylation is involved in regulating the size of puncta, Flag-Sept8-204 or the nonpalmitoylated Flag-Sept8-204-3CA was coexpressed with Sept5-Ha in N2a cells. Interestingly, the results showed that Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha produces small size vesicle-like structure, however, Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha produces large puncta (Figure 2I,J, upper). Both Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha and Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha were weakly colocalized with early endosome marker Rab5, lysosome marker Lamp1, autophagy marker LC3 or Golgi marker GM130 in N2a cells (Supporting Information S1: Figure 2C). Consistently, inhibiting palmitoylation by 2-BP treatment transforms small size to large size puncta in cells expressing Sept8-204/Sept5 (Figure 2I,J, under). As we measure the size of vesicle-like structure, it suggests that the large puncta produced by Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha is comparable to that of the Flag-Sept8-201/Sept5-Ha (Figure 1A,B), hinting that palmitoylation at the C-terminus of Sept8-204 is essential for the formation of small size vesicle-like structure. Additionally, applying live-cell imaging, it was shown that Flag-Sept8-204/ Sept5-Ha induced vesicles are moving around very rapidly, while Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha induced puncta are not moving dynamically, rather tend to gather together to form large puncta (Figure 2K, Supporting Information S1: Figure S3, Supporting Information S2: Videos 2-5). These results supported that Sept8-204 palmitoylation is required to maintain the stability of small vesicle-like structure.\n**| ZDHHC17 mediated Sept8-204 palmitoylation dynamically regulated vesicle size**\nPrevious study suggested that ZDHHC17 may catalyze the palmitoylation of Sept8. 21 For confirmation, first, we performed immunoprecipitation assay and the results showed that ZDHHC17-Ha (C-terminal Ha-tagged ZDHHC17) does coprecipitate with Flag-Sept8-204/ Sept5-Ha (Figure 3A,B), and importantly, the expression of ZDHHC17-Ha enhances (Figure 3C,D), while the deletion of ZDHHC17 (Supporting Information S1: Figure 4) decreases (Figure 3E,F), the level of Sept8-204 palmitoylation. Furthermore, to test whether ZDHHC17 is involved in regulating vesicle size, Flag-Sept8-204/ Sept5-Ha was coexpressed in either N2a/WT or N2a/ ZDHHC17-KO cells, and the imaging data showed that Sept8-204/Sept5 produces small sized vesicle-like structure in N2a/WT cells, whereas Sept8-204/Sept5 produces large puncta in ZDHHC17-KO cells (Figure 3G,H), implying that ZDHHC17 mediated Sept8-204 palmitoylation is required for small sized vesicle formation. As shown in Figure 2G,H that depalmitoylation inhibitor PalmB may increase the level of palm-Sept8-204, indeed, the incubation of PalmB significantly augments the level of palm-Sept8-204 in ZDHHC17-KO cells (Figure 3I,J). Dynamically, the large puncta in ZDHHC17-KO is turning into small sized vesicle-like structure upon the treatment of PalmB (Figure 3K,L). Together, these data support that ZDHHC17 mediated Sept8-204 palmitoylation dynamically regulates the size of puncta.\n**| PPT1 negatively regulates Sept8-204 palmitoylation and modulates puncta size**\nPPT1 was suggested to catalyze the depalmitoylation of Sept8-204. 22 For confirmation, PPT1-Ha (C-terminal Hatagged PPT1) was coexpressed and the results showed that PPT1 does significantly lower the level of palm-Sept8-204 (Figure 4A,B). Moreover, the loss of PPT1 increases the level of palm-Sept8-204 (Figure 4C,D). Plus, the IP experiment suggested that PPT1 precipitates with Sept8-204/Sept5 (Figure 4E,F). These data supported that PPT1 catalyzes the depalmitoylation of Sept8-204. Next, we thought to test whether palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP might alter Sept8-204 palmitoylation in PPT1-KO cells. 22 ABE results showed that 2-BP treatment again significantly downregulates the level of palm-Sept8-204 in N2a/PPT1-KO cells (Figure 4G,H). Consequently, small sized vesicle-like structure in PPT1-KO cells transforms into large puncta upon the treatment of 2-BP (Figure 4I,J). In total, these experiments suggest that PPT1 depalmitoylates Sept8-204 and thus modulates the formation of puncta in N2a cells.\n**| Sept8-204 palmitoylation dynamically modulates the colocalization of vesicle-like structure with SYP**\nSept8 and Sept5 were suggested to be involved in neuronal exocytosis, whereby they colocalize with SYP and Syntaxin1A. 23 To determine whether the palmitoylation of Sept8-204 is required for this process, we transfected Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha or Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha with OFP-SYP (C-terminal orange fluorescent protein) in N2a cells and the results showed that Sept8-204/Sept5 (form small vesicle-like structure) induced vesicle colocalizes well with SYP (colocalization rate, 84.13%), while that of the Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5 with SYP is about 11.86% (Figure 5A-C). In parallel, loss of ZDHHC17 decreases the level of palm-Sept8-204 (Figure 3E,F) and thus keeps the low colocalization rate of Sept8-204/Sept5 (form large puncta) with SYP (17.24%) (Figure 5D upper, Figure 5E,F). Critically, upregulated level of palm-Sept8-204 (Figure 3I,J) induced by PalmB in N2a/ZDHHC17-KO cells dramatically enhances the colocalization rate of Sept8-204/Sept5 with SYP (63.49%) (Figure 5D under, Figure 5F). Consistently, these findings are in line with the coprecipitation results (Figure 5G-J). Together, the above data revealed that modulating Sept8-204 palmitoylation dynamically regulate the colocalization of vesicle-like structure with SYP.\nTo investigate whether Sept8-204 palmitoylation is involved in regulating the colocalization of vesicle-like structure with endogenous SYP, Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha or Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha were expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. The imaging data showed that Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha is enriched in SYP-positive signal (Figure 6A, upper panel and Figure 6D, and Supporting Information S1: Figure 5A) and show small vesicle-like structure and nice colocalization (75.00%), while Flag-Sept8-204-3CA, or Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5 treated with 2-BP, mainly retains within the soma as large puncta and is largely no longer colocalized with SYP (Figure 6A-C and Supporting Information S1: Figure 5A). Next, to test whether KClinduced the firing of action potentials in neurons may be relevant for such cellular phenomenon, KCl (55 mM) was used to treat cultured hippocampal neurons and the results showed that KCl-induced depolarization decreased the palmitoylation level of Sept8-204 in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure 6E,F). Consequently, Sept8-204/Sept5 induced vesicle-like structure transforms into large puncta in the soma of neurons when treated with KCl (Figure 6G-I). Furthermore, to assess whether endogenously-expressed Sept8-204 may have similar behavior, cultured hippocampal neurons were used. The corresponding results showed that scattered Sept8 is tending to accumulate into larger aggregates (Supporting Information S1: Figure 5B), partially mimics the behaviors illustrated in ectopically expressed conditions when palm-Sept8 is downregulated (Figure 6A). However, one should note that commercially-available Sept8 antibody cannot differentiate between Sept8-201 and Sept8-204. Finally, to evaluate probability curve and significantly inhibited mEPSCs amplitude (Figure 6J,K). Together, these results may suggest that Sept8-204 palmitoylation is relevant for neurophysiological functions and required for the colocalization of Sept8-204/Sept5 induced vesicle with SYP.\n**| DISCUSSION**\nPrevious studies suggested that Sept8 partners with Sept5, 15,24 the proper cellular localization of Sept8 and Sept5 requires concomitant expression of both proteins and coexpression of Sept8/Sept5 results in both proteins targeted to a vesicle-like location. 15 By analyzing Sept8 variants, Sept8-201 and Sept8-204 were found highly expressed in the mouse brain (Supporting Information S1: Figure 1A,B). Consistently, our immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that the coexpression of Sept8-204 and Sept5 could form vesicle-like structures in N2a (Figure 1), as shown in previous reports. 15 While the coexpression of Sept8-201/Sept5 or Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5 forms large puncta (Figures 1 and2), a phenomenon that has not been reported. Furthermore, it was revealed that dynamic palmitoylation of Sept8-204, maintained by ZDHHC17 and PPT1, is essential for the transformation of vesicle-like structure either large or small (Figures 3 and4). Nevertheless, here we uncovered a mechanism in N2a cells that the expression of transcriptional variants of Sept8 (Sept8-201 or Sept8-204) and Sept5 produce different sized vesicle-like structure, which is controlled by protein palmitoylation of Sept8-204.\nVarious lines of evidence showed that both Sept8 and Sept5 locate in the presynaptic membrane and have been shown to interact with VAMP2, syntain-1 of SNARE complex. 10,12,13 Moreover, Sept8 promotes the release of VAMP2 form SYP during action potential stimulation and enhanced docking of vesicles to presynaptic membrane, 12 while Sept5 negatively regulate synaptic vesicle release at presynaptic membrane. 10,25 Indeed, small size vesicle-like structure induced by the expression of Sept8-204/Sept5 colocalizes with SYP, a marker of synaptic vesicles, in neuronal branches, indicating that small size vesicle-like structure may be involved in modulating the dynamics of synaptic vesicles. Consistently, the application of KCl (55 mM) to induce the firing of action potentials significantly downregulates the level of Sept8-204 palmitoylation and therefore may alter the localization, size, as well as physiological function of vesicle-like structure in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure 6). Similarly, inhibiting Sept8 palmitoylation by 2-BP or the expression of Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5 in cultured hippocampal neurons produces large puncta, which mainly resides in the soma of cell body (Figure 6). These data suggested that Sept8-204/ Sept5 colocalize with SYP and may have functional relevance in the firing of action potentials. Indeed, a recent study reported that palmitoylation of Sept8 goes up with chemical long-term potentiation, 26 implying that Sept8 palmitoylation is closely associated with neuronal activities.\nIt should be noted that the deletion of ZDHHC17 does not completely abrogate the level of palm-Sept8-204, and the facts that palmB or 2-BP can further modulate Sept8-204 palmitoylation in ZDHHC17-KO or PPT1-KO cells, suggesting that other unknown palmitoyltransferases or thioesterases may also be involved in regulating the dynamicity of palm-Sept8-204. Indeed, in a different study where it was reported that multiple ZDHHCs can enhance the level of palm-Sept8-204, 22 extending the evidence that the regulation of the homeostasis of Sept8-204 palmitoylation is likely important and complicated in neurons.\nCollectively, here we showed that palmitoylation is essential for Sept8-204 and Sept5 to form vesicle-like structure and distribute along neuronal branches, where they colocalize with SYP. In the firing of action potentials, Sept8-204 palmitoylation is downregulated and may result in the relocation of vesicle-like structure into the soma of neural cells. Our study implicated that dynamic Sept8-204 palmitoylation and Sept5 may play important roles in modulating the activity of action potentials. \n\n\nSept8 is a vesicle associated protein and there are two typical transcriptional variants (Sept8-204 and Sept8-201) expressed in mice brain. Interestingly, the coexpression of Sept8-204/Sept5 induces the formation of small sized vesiclelike structure, while that of the Sept8-201/Sept5 produces large puncta. Sept8 is previously shown to be palmitoylated. Here it was further revealed that protein palmitoylation is required for Sept8-204/Sept5 to maintain small sized vesiclelike structure and colocalize with synaptophysin, since either the expression of nonpalmitoylated Sept8-204 mutant (Sept8-204-3CA) or inhibiting Sept8-204 palmitoylation by 2-BP with Sept5 produces large puncta, which barely colocalizes with synaptophysin (SYP). Moreover, it was shown that the dynamic palmitoylation of Sept8-204 is controlled by ZDHHC17 and PPT1, loss of ZDHHC17 decreases Sept8-204 palmitoylation and induces large puncta, while loss of PPT1 increases Sept8-204 palmitoylation and induces small sized vesiclelike structure. Together, these findings suggest that palmitoylation is essential for the maintenance of the small sized vesicle-like structure for Sept8-204/Sept5, and may hint their important roles in synaptic functions.\n\n",
