    "abstract": "Inflammation is initiated and driven by a mixture of mediators, which modify effects of each other. This study analysed in vitro pro-inflammatory activity of inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha and IL-1beta) in a combination with a lipid DAMP molecule, oxidized palmitoyl-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine (OxPAPC). The study was performed on endothelial and monocytic cell lines. The cells were treated with different concentrations of TNFalpha or IL-1beta, OxPAPC and their combinations, either in the presence or absence of drugs regulating inflammation. Pro-inflammatory effects of TNFalpha/IL-1beta and OxPAPC were estimated by analysis of chemokines CXCL8, CXCL2 and CXCL3 by ELISA and RT-PCR. Toxicity was determined by analysis of metabolic activity. Statistical significance was estimated by ANOVA and Dunnett's test. OxPAPC was a much weaker chemokine inducer as compared to TNFalpha or IL-1beta. However, OxPAPC and TNFalpha/IL-1beta together induced effects that were significantly stronger than the arithmetical sum of individual effects. This cooperative action of OxPAPC and TNFalpha was reversed by inhibitors of p38 MAPK. We hypothesise that the boosting of TNFalpha and IL-1beta effects by OxPAPC may be more pathologically important than the action of the lipid alone. Inhibitors of p38 MAPK may become a tool for analysis of pathological role of oxidized phospholipids.\n"
