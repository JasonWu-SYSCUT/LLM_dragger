    "abstract": "S-palmitoylation is a dynamic lipid-based protein post-translational modification facilitated by a family of protein acyltransferases (PATs) commonly known as DHHC-PATs or DHHCs. It is the only lipid modification that is reversible, and this very fact uniquely qualifies it for therapeutic interventions through the development of DHHC inhibitors. Herein, we report that 4''-alkyl ether lipophilic derivatives of EGCG can effectively inhibit protein S-palmitoylation in vitro. With the help of metabolic labeling followed by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition Click reaction, we demonstrate that 4''-C(14) EGCG and 4''-C(16) EGCG markedly inhibited S-palmitoylation in various mammalian cells including HEK 293T, HeLa, and MCF-7 using both in gel fluorescence as well as confocal microscopy. Further, these EGCG derivatives were able to attenuate the S-palmitoylation to the basal level in DHHC3-overexpressed cells, suggesting that they are plausibly targeting DHHCs. Confocal microscopy data qualitatively reflected spatial and temporal distribution of S-palmitoylated proteins in different sub-cellular compartments and the inhibitory effects of 4''-C(14) EGCG and 4''-C(16) EGCG were clearly observed in the native cellular environment. Our findings were further substantiated by in silico analysis which revealed promising binding affinity and interactions of 4''-C(14) EGCG and 4''-C(16) EGCG with key amino acid residues present in the hydrophobic cleft of the DHHC20 enzyme. We also demonstrated the successful inhibition of S-palmitoylation of GAPDH by 4''-C(16) EGCG. Taken together, our in vitro and in silico data strongly suggest that 4''-C(14) EGCG and 4''-C(16) EGCG can act as potent inhibitors for S-palmitoylation and can be employed as a complementary tool to investigate S-palmitoylation.\n",
    "fragment": "(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, Fig. 1b), the major green tea polyphenol, is known for its enormous biological activities [28], including anti-obesity, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-viral, and anti-oxidant activity, etc. Despite exhibiting such a wide array of biological activities, the use of EGCG in clinical trials is limited due to poor bioavailability, chemical instability, low membrane permeability, and rapid metabolism [28]. We have previously synthesized a series of lipophilic derivatives of EGCG and successfully demonstrated its interaction with membrane-associated tyrosine kinase EGFR. Among the seven derivatives with varied lengths of alkyl chains, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG (Fig. 1b) gave promising inhibition on EGFR activity. The underlying mechanism of inhibition of this derivative was attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the molecule which facilitated its interaction with membrane proteins more effectively [29]. A recent report by the Banerjee group revealed the crystal structure of zDHHC20 and zebrafish zDHHC15 explaining the details of the transmembrane and catalytic domains. The four transmembrane domains contributed to the formation of a cavity that accommodated the acyl chain of 2-BP [30]. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that the lipophilic derivative of EGCG namely, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG, and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG (Fig. 1b) could inhibit the DHHC-mediated S-palmitoylation of proteins in vitro. With the help of metabolic labeling and copper-catalyzed Click chemistry (Fig. 1c,d) in the presence of alkynyl-tagged palmitic acid (Alk-14, Fig. 1b), we observed that 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG were effective in inhibiting the global S-palmitoylation in HEK 293T and 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG as well as 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG in case of MCF-7 and HeLa cells. Notably, 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG significantly reduced the global palmitoylation protein profile to basal levels in DHHC3-overexpressing cells, which indicates the plausible effect of these molecules on the DHHC enzyme activity. The confocal images revealed the widely distributed spatial and temporal arrangement of Spalmitoylated proteins all over the cell especially on the lipid associated organelles. It also clearly exhibited the inhibition of metabolic labeling of Alk-14 in the presence of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG and not with unmodified EGCG. Further, in silico molecular docking analysis of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG with DHHC20 revealed better binding affinities for the aforementioned EGCG derivatives in comparison to the pan-DHHC inhibitor, 2-BP, or unmodified EGCG. The acyl chain of these lipophilic derivatives was found inserted into the hydrophobic cavity formed by the four transmembrane domains of the DHHC20. The hydrophobic and other non-covalent interactions found in the 2D interaction analysis showed that the catalytic C156 residue was closely posed to interact with EGCG. The molecular dynamics (MD) of the DHHC protein in each of the simulated complexes demonstrated a stable and nearly consistent RMSD pattern. Our pull-down experiment with GAPDH also demonstrated the inhibition of S-palmitoylation by 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG. Taken together, our in vitro and in silico data show that 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG can effectively inhibit DHHC-mediated protein S-palmitoylation.",
    "fullText": "**Introduction**\nProtein S-palmitoylation is one of the most critical protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) and the only protein lipidation that is reversible in nature. Herein, the cysteine side chains of target proteins get modified with the palmitoyl group via a labile thioester bond. It is a dynamic PTM that plays a critical role in cell health by regulating the subcellular localization, stability, membrane trafficking, and function of proteins [1]. Protein S-palmitoylation is a prevalent PTM that affects almost 10% of the total human proteome highlighting its wide scope [2].\nThe addition of the palmitoyl group to proteins is facilitated by the writer enzymes, namely, protein palmitoyl acyltransferases (DHHC-PATs or, DHHCs) and deacylation is carried over by eraser enzymes called acyl protein thioesterases (APTs) (Fig. 1a) [3]. The writer enzyme, DHHCs, are conserved from yeast to humans and are so defined due to the presence of a highly conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) catalytic domain [4]. While, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (yeast) are known to possess five DHHC isoforms, the human genome encodes for twentythree isoforms of DHHCs designated as DHHC1 to DHHC24, omitting DHHC10 [5,6]. DHHCs are known to catalyze the addition of the palmitoyl group to the cysteine residues of the target protein via a twostep mechanism involving a transient acyl-intermediate via the autoacylation process [7]. The emerging shreds of evidence demonstrate the involvement of DHHCs in normal as well as a number of diseased states including various types of cancer, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. [8]. Critically important proteins such as Ras isoforms [9,10], Src-related tyrosine kinases [11], epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [12], subunits of G-protein and G-protein coupled receptors [13], rhodopsin [14], mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) [15], postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) [16], and synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP 25) [17] are known to get Spalmitoylated. Protein S-palmitoylation has also been shown to play an instrumental role in the pathogenicity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus by aiding the membrane fusion of viruses onto host cells [15,[18][19][20][21][22].\nThe reversible nature of S-palmitoylation which gives this lipid PTM a distinct identity from the other protein lipidation could be explored in developing therapeutic strategies to circumvent issues related to many diseases as mentioned above. There have been a handful of DHHC inhibitors reported to date which include certain lipid-based molecules such as 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), cerulenin, and tunicamycin [23]. While 2-BP (Fig. 1b) is primarily known for inhibiting protein palmitoylation, it also has significant number of off-targets such as fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, acyl-CoA synthetase etc. [24]. Ducker et al. reported a small molecule inhibitor compound V from a screen of 8000 compounds using an in situ imaging-based assay [25]. Apart from that, very recently Qiu et al. reported the antimalarial natural product artemisinin to bind and inhibit zDHHC6 [26]. Around the same time, Dickinson's group reported cyano-myracrylamide, a pan-DHHC inhibitor with comparable inhibitory effect to that of 2-BP [27]. With the expansion of understanding the role and importance of DHHC-mediated biology, there also increases the urgent requirement for the identification of inhibitors for DHHCs. While there have been efforts in developing synthetic small molecule inhibitors for DHHCs, till now there is only one natural product-based DHHC inhibitor (Artemisinin). Natural product-based inhibitors have the added advantage of targeting the cancer cells preferably as compared to healthy non-cancerous cells.\n(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, Fig. 1b), the major green tea polyphenol, is known for its enormous biological activities [28], including anti-obesity, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-viral, and anti-oxidant activity, etc. Despite exhibiting such a wide array of biological activities, the use of EGCG in clinical trials is limited due to poor bioavailability, chemical instability, low membrane permeability, and rapid metabolism [28].

Our pull-down experiment with GAPDH also demonstrated the inhibition of S-palmitoylation by 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG. Taken together, our in vitro and in silico data show that 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG can effectively inhibit DHHC-mediated protein S-palmitoylation.\n\n**Materials and methods**\n(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was purchased from Carbosynth Ltd., UK, and Alkynyl palmitic acid (Alk-14) and carboxyrhodamine 110 azide were obtained from Click Chemistry Tools, USA. 2-Bromopalmitate, Protease inhibitor cocktail, DMSO, 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA), CuSO 4 \u22c55H 2 O, tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) were procured from Sigma Aldrich while tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine (TBTA) was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Coomassie brilliant blue R250 (CBB) (Sisco Research Laboratories), ECL reagent (Bio-Rad), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical (DPPH) (TCI chemicals) were purchased from the commercial sources as mentioned in the parenthesis. Anti-HA and m-IgG Fc BP-HRP bundles were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.\n**Chemical synthesis of 4\u2033-alkyl ether lipophilic derivatives of EGCG**\nThe 4\u2033-alkyl ether lipophilic derivatives of EGCG with carbon chain length ranging from C 6 to C 18 (Fig. S1, ESI) were synthesized following the reported protocol from our group [29]. All the compounds were purified, and thoroughly characterized as, mentioned earlier [29].\n**Cell culture, treatment and transfection**\nHuman cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, and human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK 293T were procured from the Cell Repository, National Center of Cell Science Pune, India, and were maintained as per the instructions. Cells were grown in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, HiMedia) media with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, HiMedia), 1% Pen-Strep, and 0.2% Amphotericin (HiMedia). The cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 and were maintained according to the standard procedure in ATCC guidelines.\nCells were seeded with 0.6 \u00d7 10 6 cells per well in a 6-well cell culture plate and allowed to fix to the substratum overnight. Cells were pretreated with 4\u2033-alkyl ether lipophilic derivatives of EGCG (50 \u03bcM) for 6 h and then incubated with 50 \u03bcM Alk-14 for another 6 h. All the stock preparation was done in 100% DMSO. DMSO concentration was maintained at < 0.02% in all treatments. HA-tagged DHHC3 plasmids were transiently transfected in HEK 293T cells using calcium phosphate method [31]. Transfection efficiency was analyzed through Western blotting and probing the proteins against anti-HA antibody.\n**Cell viability analysis**\nThe cells (HeLa and MCF-7) were seeded at a cell density of 10,000 cells in each well and incubated for 24 h in the presence of various concentration ranging from 0 to 300 \u03bcM of 4\u2033-alkyl ether lipophilic derivatives of EGCG (4\u2033-C n EGCG, n = 6, 8, 10,12,14,16,18). After the treatment, 10 \u03bcL of MTT (from a 5 mg/mL stock) was added into each well and the plate was incubated at 37 \u2022 C for further 2 h. The media was aspirated out carefully without disturbing the cells and the formazan crystals formed were dissolved in DMSO solvent (100 \u03bcL). The absorbance was recorded at 590 nm with 620 nm reference reading (for negating the background) using a BioTek EPOCH 2 plate reader. The IC 50 values were determined by generating a nonlinear regression curve fit using the GraphPad Prism 7 software. All experiments were performed in triplicates and the SEM was calculated from three independent experiments. The IC 50 values were represented as (mean \u00b1 SEM).\n**Visualization of global S-palmitoylation level via in gel fluorescence**\nCells were treated as mentioned above in Section 2.2 and lysed thereafter using lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40 and protease inhibitor cocktail. 50 \u03bcg of proteins were incubated with a Click chemistry reaction mixture comprising 200 \u03bcM carboxyrhodamine 110 azide, 600 \u03bcM of TBTA, 2 mM of TCEP, and 2 mM of CuSO 4 for 1 h. The Clicked proteins were then precipitated by adding 200 \u03bcL ice-cold Methanol, 75 \u03bcL ice-cold CHCl 3 , and 150 \u03bcL ice-cold PBS to the Clicked samples. After a gentle agitation, the samples were centrifuged at 20,000g for 20 min at 4 \u2022 C. The upper aqueous phase was aspirated out carefully without disturbing the protein disk. The protein disk was allowed to settle down in the tube by adding another 1 mL of ice-cold methanol. The liquid phase was completely aspirated out without disturbing the protein pellet. The disk was then washed with 1 mL of methanol (ice cold) 3 times and subjected to air-dry. 4% SDS buffer was used to redissolve the precipitated protein before loading the samples into the SDS-PAGE. The proteins were denatured in 4X loading dye with 100 mM DTT at 95 \u2022 C for 10 min before resolving in 9% SDS-PAGE. The gel was destained overnight at 4 \u2022 C followed by swelling the gel in distilled water for half an hour. Further, the gel was analyzed for fluorescence signals at 525 nm in the Syngene G box.\n**Qualitative analysis of metabolic labeling via confocal imaging upon the inhibitor treatments**\nCells were grown on coverslips and treatment was conducted as mentioned above. After treatment cells were washed with 1X PBS thoroughly and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C. Further cells were washed in 1X PBS and permeabilized using 0.25% Triton X 100 in 1X PBS for 20 min and then blocked with 1% BSA in 1X PBS. The cells grown on coverslips were incubated to Click reaction master mix (100 \u03bcM carboxyrhodamine 110 azide, 100 \u03bcM TBTA, 1 mM CuSO 4, and 1 mM TCEP in 1 mL 1X PBS) for 1 h in dark at room temperature in shaking condition. The cells were further washed with 1X PBS and mounted over microscopic glass slides using 90% glycerol. The confocal images were acquired at 488 nm wavelength using Olympus FLUOVIEW FV3000. Laser power and exposure time were kept the same for all acquisition. Importantly, laser power and exposure time were first adjusted to acquire images for the samples treated with Alk-14 only, which were then fixed as default parameters for acquiring all other images for samples treated with EGCG derivatives. This allowed us to compare the difference in fluorescence intensities obtained in samples treated with 2-BP, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG and with samples treated with Alk-14 alone.\n**Western blotting**\nTreated cells were lysed and protein was estimated using the Bradford assay. The 50 \u03bcg proteins were denatured in 4X loading dye before resolving in 9% or 12% SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred on the PVDF membrane and probed against an anti-HA antibody.\n**Antioxidant assay**\nTotal radical scavenging capacity of EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG were compared using a slightly modified version of the 2,2diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazylhydrate (DPPH) assay technique [32]. Briefly, 0.2 mM DPPH solution was prepared in 95% methanol. EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG stock solutions were made in concentration ranging from 1 \u03bcM -2 mM in DMSO. Finally, 50 \u03bcL of EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG stock solutions were diluted to a final concentration of 0.25-500 \u03bcM with 150 \u03bcL of DPPH solution in a 96-well plate and incubated in dark for 1.5 h at room temperature. The absorbance was recorded at a wavelength of 517 nm using a BioTek EPOCH 2 plate reader. The percentage of radical scavenging activity (RSA) was calculated using the equation:\nwhere, A s stands for absorbance of sample and A c for absorbance of control. IC 50 values for each of the compounds were estimated with nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software.\n**DCFDA assay**\nROS production by the EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG were assessed by using DCFDA probe. In brief, HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of H 2 O 2 , EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG for 6 h. H 2 O 2 was taken as a positive control for ROS induction. The media was removed post-treatment and then replenished with fresh media containing 10 \u03bcM DCFDA and was incubated for 30 min in the dark at 37 \u2022 C. Then, the cells were washed with 1X PBS to remove excess DCFDA probe and fresh media was added. Fluorescence images were acquired at 488 nm/530 nm (ex/em wavelength) at 20X magnification using Olympus IX83.\n**Docking studies and analysis**\n**Protein preparations**\nThe co-crystal structure of DHHC20 palmitoyltransferase with 2-BP [30] (PDB ID: 6BML) was obtained from protein databank (www.rcsb. org) [33]. The protein was prepared for docking in AutoDock v4.2 program [19,34,35]. Chain B was deleted, as it does not interfere with the catalytic part of DHHCs. Water molecules, heteroatoms, and cocrystallized ligand were removed. Hydrogens and missing atoms were added, and Gasteiger charges were computed. The file was subsequently saved in pdbqt format and the protein was ready for docking.\n**Ligand preparations**\nThe structures of ligands were prepared in Avogadro [36], and energy was minimized. They were further converted to pdbqt files, which had atomic charges, atom definition for ligands, and topological information for docking using Open Babel GUI (openbabel.org) [37].\n**Docking studies using AutoDock Vina**\nThe energy-minimized structure of the ligands were docked with DHHC20 using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2 [38,39]. The grid consisted of the active site and hydrophobic cleft with dimensions 16 \u00c5 \u00d7 28 \u00c5 \u00d7 68 \u00c5 centered in x, y, and z coordinates at 26.889, -49.583, and -42.333. These parameters were used to prepare an input file for AutoDock Vina.\nPerl script was used to run the docking for all the molecules [40]. The grid parameters were confirmed to be well established by docking 2-BP against the protein and comparing it with the covalently bound 2-BP. The best-docked structures with the highest binding affinity were visualized.\n**Protein-ligand interaction studies**\nBiovia Discovery Studio 2021 software (Accelrys, San Diego, 2012) was used to investigate the 2-Dimension protein-ligand interactions for the docked molecules and the binding affinity values were compared. All the interactions, which comprised of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interaction, Van der Waals' interactions due to atom accessibilities, and other electrostatic interactions, were taken into consideration. Chimera X [41] was used to visualize the protein surface based on hydrophobicity.\n**Molecular dynamics studies**\nThe PlayMolecule ProteinPrepare web application, which uses PROPKA 3.1 and PDB2PQR 2.1, was used to determine the protonation state and optimize the H-network for the structures [42]. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out using the pmemd.cuda module of the AMBER18 MD simulation package. The primary force field employed for the protein was ff14SB [43], while the General Amber Force Field (GAFF2) [44] was used for modeling ligands. Within the protein, two zinc metal centers were present, consisting of four cysteines and one histidine amino acid surrounding the zinc ion. To prepare the system, the Zinc AMBER force field (ZAFF) was employed to handle the 4-coordinated zinc metal centers [45][46][47]. The atomic partial charges of the five ligands were determined using the AM1-BCC model using the antechamber module of amber [48,49]. The solvation of the complex structures utilized the TIP3P water model and a truncated octahedron periodic box extended at least 10 \u00c5 from the solute [50]. Counterions were added as needed to neutralize the solvated system. Hydrogen bonds were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm, and temperature control at 300 K was achieved using the Langevin thermostat with a collision frequency of 2 ps -1 [51][52][53]. Long-range electrostatic interactions were handled using the Particle-mesh Ewald (PME) scheme [54]. The non-bonded cutoff was set to 10 \u00c5. The solvated systems were energy minimized in two stages. In the first stage, all solute atoms of the system were restrained to their respective initial positions with force constant of 2 kcal mol -1 \u00c5 -2 , and the system was energy minimized by 500 steps of the steepest descent followed by another 500 steps of the conjugate gradient scheme. In the second stage, again each system was minimized using 500 steps of the steepest descent followed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient without positional constraints. Following the minimization, each system was heated from 0 to 300 K via MD simulation of 50 ps in the NVT ensemble using a 2 kcal mol -1 \u00c5 -2 restrain on the solute. Following this, all systems were equilibrated for 1.0 ns without any restraints. Finally, production MD simulations were conducted for 200 ns in the NPT ensemble at 300 K and 1 atm pressure. For trajectory analysis the cpptraj module of AmberTools19 was employed [68]. The simulation was then followed by calculation of the binding free energy which was estimated using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) scheme [55][56][57]. A total of 5000 conformations from the last 100 ns of the trajectory were used to estimate the binding free energy.\n**Streptavidin pull-down experiment**\nHeLa cells were pretreated with 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG, 2-BP and metabolically labelled with Alk-14 as described above. The protein concentration was determined for the whole lysates using Bradford reagent and 1 mg protein was subjected to Click reaction with biotin azide [biotin azide (200 \u03bcM), TBTA (600 \u03bcM), CuSO 4 (4 mM), and TCEP (4 mM)]. The Click reaction mixture was incubated at RT for 1 h with gentle shaking.\nProteins were then precipitated using ice-cold acetone at 20 \u2022 C for 1 h. The protein pellet was obtained by centrifuging at 10,000g for 15 min at 4 \u2022 C and was then solubilized with 0.2% SDS in 1X PBS using a water bath sonicator. The solubilized protein mixture was mixed with prewashed (0.2% SDS in 1X PBS, 2 washes) avidin beads and was incubated for 1.5 h at RT on a gyratory shaker. After the incubation, the beads were thoroughly washed with 1 mL 0.2% SDS in PBS (3 times), 1 mL 1X PBS (3 times), and finally with 1 mL Milli-Q H 2 O (3 times). Finally, 2X loading dye was added to the avidin beads and the mixture was boiled at 95 \u2022 C for 5 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation and equal volume were loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gel and then the proteins were transferred to the PVDF membrane. The membrane was probed against anti GAPDH antibody.\n**Statistical analysis**\nAll statistical analysis were performed employing GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, CA, USA). All the data were represented as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM) from 3 independent experiments. The IC 50 values were obtained by performing non-linear regression analysis. Statistical differences were found using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test. The statistical significance was represented as 'ns' (non-significant) for p > 0.05, * for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, *** for p < 0.001 and **** for p < 0.0001.\n\n**Results and discussion**\n**4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG inhibit protein S-palmitoylation in HEK 293T, and HeLa cells**\nWe have recently reported a series of lipophilic derivatives of EGCG with varied alkyl chains and among them, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG (Fig. 1d) exhibited potent inhibition towards membrane-bound EGFR in various cancer cells. The affinity towards EGFR was attributed to the increased hydrophobicity of the alkyl chain. The native substrate of DHHCs, palmitoyl-CoA, also has a long hydrophobic chain which prompted us to think the presence of a long hydrophobic tail in 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C EGCG can guide the EGCG derivatives into the catalytic pocket of DHHC and inhibit palmitoylation. Therefore, we went ahead and designed an experiment to check the effect of all 4\u2033-alkyl ether lipophilic derivatives of EGCG (4\u2033-C n EGCG, n = 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, Fig. S1, ESI) on the global S-palmitoylation profile. Briefly, cells were incubated in the presence of EGCG derivatives (50 \u03bcM) for 6 h followed by treatment with Alk-14 (50 \u03bcM) for another 6 h in the same media. The treated cells were lysed and the protein lysates were subjected to Click reaction with carboxyrhodamine 110 azide followed by an SDS-PAGE analysis. The in gel fluorescence images (Fig. 2a and Fig. S2,ESI) clearly demonstrate the marked inhibition of Alk-14 metabolic labeling in the presence of EGCG derivatives, namely 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG for HEK 293 T cells, and 4\u2033-C EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG for HeLa cells. A decrease in Alk-14 metabolic labeling indicated the inhibition of protein S-palmitoylation. It was noteworthy that inhibition of Alk-14 metabolic labeling by 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG was comparable to the inhibition induced by broad spectrum DHHC inhibitor 2-BP. Of note, EGCG alone was unable to show any inhibition and it is probably because of the lack of any directing group (long hydrophobic alkyl chain) present in it. We also conducted a cell viability analysis using the MTT assay for HeLa, and MCF-7 cell lines treated with various lipophilic derivatives of EGCG at various concentrations ranging from 1 to 300 \u03bcM. The IC 50 values from HeLa, and MCF-7 cell lines have been listed in Table 1. The lipophilic derivatives of EGCG with shorter acyl chains (4\u2033-C 6 EGCG, 4\u2033-C 8 EGCG) are found to be less toxic as compared to their longer acyl chain counterparts.\n**4\u2033-C 16 EGCG inhibits protein S-palmitoylation in DHHC3overexpressed HEK 293T cells**\nTo get direct evidence on whether 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG targets DHHC to reduce protein S-palmitoylation, we overexpressed HA-tagged DHHC3 in HEK 293T cells and analyzed the metabolic labeling of Alk-14 in the presence of 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG. As expected, overexpression of DHHC3 resulted in an increase in Alk-14 labeling. Intriguingly, 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG significantly alleviated the levels of DHHC-mediated S-palmitoylation and brought it to its basal level (Fig. 2b). Banerjee's group in their seminal work on the structural aspects of DHHC have elucidated the mechanism of DHHC-mediated addition of palmitic acid to the substrate proteins via a two-step mechanism. The thiolate of the cysteine group at the active site of the enzyme, which resides on the membrane cytosol interphase, is known to transiently react with the long chain fatty acyl-CoAs to form an auto-acylated DHHC intermediate [30]. In this conformation, the acyl chain lies embedded in the hydrophobic groove formed between Transmembrane 2 (TM2) and Transmembrane 3 (TM3) of the DHHC enzyme [30,58]. This fatty acyl chain is then transferred to the cysteine group present on the enzyme substrate [59]. DHHCs have been implicated in playing essential role in a wide range of diseases, including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, bacterial and viral infections etc. [60]. Thus, it is noteworthy that the identification of DHHC inhibitors can be fruitful in combating life-threatening diseases. The alkyl chain present on the 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG, and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG mimics the structure of palmitic acid, which further strengthen our hypothesis that suggest the plausibility of recognition of these alkyl chain by the hydrophobic cleft formed in the DHHC enzyme. This interaction can be considered as the main driving force for bringing the reported inhibitors in close proximity with the catalytic core of the DHHC enzyme.\n**4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG retain the innate biological activity of EGCG**\nFurther, we wanted to examine whether the regioselective conjugation of alkyl chain at 4\u2033 position of EGCG had any significant effects on the innate biological activity of EGCG namely, the prooxidant and antioxidant activities [61]. To achieve this, we conducted DPPH assay to estimate the antioxidant activity and DCFDA staining to measure the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. The radical scavenging assay using DPPH radical (Fig. 3a andb) clearly shows that the antioxidant activity of EGCG is retained after the modification at 4\u2033 position. EGCG is also known to impart prooxidant effect in cancer cells [62,63]. Thus, we went on to investigate the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species using DCFDA staining in EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C EGCG treated HeLa cells. The fluorescence images and relative fluorescence intensity graph (Fig. 3c andd) further demonstrate that the addition of alkyl chains at 4\u2033 position of EGCG did not compromise on the prooxidant activity of EGCG. Instead, these modifications have often substantiated the increased affinity and stability of these derivatives to lipid associated enzymes and receptors [29,64].  \n**4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG inhibit the global protein Spalmitoylation in cancer cells as revealed by Alk-14 labeling using confocal imaging**\nProtein S-palmitoylation has been implicated in the regulation of several oncogenes, including N-RAS, EGFR and tumor suppressor genes like SCRIB, melanocortin 1 receptor proteins [1,4,65,66]. Previous report from our lab successfully demonstrated that the 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG has a potent anti-tumorigenic ability to specifically induce toxicity in cancer cells such as A431, HeLa and MCF-7 in comparison to EGCG [29]. This prompted us to examine the effect of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG treatment on the S-palmitoylation profile of cancer cells. The in gel fluorescence analysis in HeLa cells (Fig. S2, ESI) demonstrated that 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG were able to inhibit the S-palmitoylation levels of proteins. Further, we designed a confocal microscopy-based experiment wherein the HeLa and MCF-7 cells were treated with 2-BP, EGCG, 4\u2033-C 12 EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG at a concentration of 50 \u03bcM for 6 h and then the cells were allowed to metabolically uptake Alk-14 for 6 h. The cells were then fixed with fixative and after permeabilization and blocking with BSA, they were subjected to Click reaction with carboxyrhodamine 110 azide. We observed that Spalmitoylation of proteins being a lipid based PTM, appeared to be uniformly distributed in all the membrane associated structures as well as other compartments in the cell which exemplifies the spatial and temporal existence of S-palmitoylated proteins in cancer cells. Moreover, it is noteworthy that DHHC enzymes are mostly found to be associated with endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG were able to bring down this extensive palmitoylation of proteins to basal level in a similar fashion shown by 2-BP. Whereas, EGCG was unable to bring this effect (Fig. 4a, b and Fig. S3, ESI). The biochemical and molecular level understanding of the S-palmitoylation inhibition induced by 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG with respect to their anticancer activity is under examination in our lab. Thus, we believe that the inhibition of S-palmitoylation by 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG may play an intriguing role in the suppression of carcinogenesis.\n**In silico studies reveal the interaction of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG with DHHC20 active site**\nCareful analysis of the above results led us to hypothesize that the hydrophobicity of the long alkyl chain may play a critical role in decreasing the level of S-palmitoylation in different cell lines. Further, our in vitro studies prompted us to conduct an in silico analysis on the binding of 4\u2033-C 12 EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG with DHHC20 enzyme, the only DHHC with resolved crystal structure from human origin. The binding score obtained for 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG against DHHC20 were found to be -7.9 and -8.0 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 5a), which were better than the binding affinity of 2-BP (-6.8 kcal/ mol), a known pan inhibitor of DHHC enzymes. The binding affinity value obtained for 4\u2033-C 12 EGCG (-7.5 kcal/mol) was lower than the longer alkyl chain derivatives, suggesting their higher extent of interaction. The best docking confirmations revealed that the acyl chain of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG (Fig. 5h,i, and Fig. S4, ESI) and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG (Fig. 5j,k, and Fig. S5,ESI) was embedded inside the hydrophobic cavity formed in between the TM2 and TM3 in a very similar way to how the acyl chain of 2-BP was lying inside the cavity (Fig. 5b,c, and Fig. S6,ESI). When the docking confirmations of EGCG alone were compared with 4\u2033-C 12 EGCG (Fig. 5f,g  The in silico 2-D interaction studies also revealed that the acyl chain of the 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG were interacting non-covalently (\u03c0-alkyl, hydrogen bonding, Van der Waals forces', etc.) with several amino acids, particularly W158 and F171 which are involved in constricting the hydrophobic cavity of the enzyme. Additionally, F174 and L227 were also found to be interacting with the acyl chain. The noncovalent and hydrophobic interaction with these amino acids suggests  that the acyl chain was stabilized inside the hydrophobic cavity (Fig. 6 and Table 2). Although 4\u2033-C 12 EGCG shows interactions with DHHC20, they were predominantly of Van der Waals type, which suggested lower extent of interaction in case of 4\u2033-C 12 EGCG as compared to our longer chain alkyl ether derivatives consisting of 14 and 16 carbons, respectively. Taken together, the molecular docking analysis of the interactions between the longer chain alkyl ether derivatives and DHHC20 suggest greater propensity of inhibition.\nTable S1 and Fig. 6 summarizes the similarity in overall interactions between 2-BP/DHHC20 compared to 4\u2033-C 12 EGCG, 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG/DHHC20. Moreover, H154 present on the catalytic site which aids in the nucleophilic attack on the cysteine [30] was found to make interactions such as hydrogen bonds and \u03c0 cation with EGCG molecule in its alkyl ether derivatives. All these shreds of evidence strongly suggest that the interactions between the alkyl chain and amino acid residues housing the hydrophobic cleft are the driving force in bringing the electrophilic group on EGCG in close proximity to the reactive cysteine present in the catalytic site of DHHC enzyme.\n**Protein dynamics simulation 3.6.1. Dynamics of DHHC protein-ligand complexes**\nThe analysis of the DHHC protein's dynamics in each of the five simulated complexes was conducted by examining the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone residues (N, C, and C \u03b1 atoms). Across all complexes, the protein demonstrated a stable and nearly consistent pattern throughout the simulation period, as illustrated in Fig. 7. While there was a minor RMSD deviation in the case of the 2-BP bound complex after 100 ns, this deviation stabilized after 150 ns (Fig. 7). The majority of fluctuations in RMSD can be primarily attributable to the protein's loops. Overall, in all systems, there was no significant degradation or substantial changes in the protein's conformation observed.\n**Free energy contribution**\nIn addition to studying the dynamics, we conducted an analysis of the binding strength between the ligand and the DHHC protein. To achieve this, we utilized the MM/PBSA approach to calculate the binding enthalpy and individual energy components associated with the interaction between the protein and ligands. The complete binding enthalpy and its components are listed in Table 3 and visualized in Fig. 8. The energy calculation shows that 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG (-45.35 \u00b1 0.07 kcal/mol), and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG (-49.39 \u00b1 0.07 kcal/mol) exhibit better binding free energy values compared to the control 2-BP (-34.36 \u00b1 0.06 kcal/mol), which aligns with experimental findings. Experimental results indicate that EGCG fails to exert any inhibitory effect, indicating its low affinity for binding to the protein. This observation aligns with the simulation results, which demonstrate a very low binding affinity for EGCG (-10.19 \u00b1 0.06 kcal/mol). Upon closer examination of the contributions from different forces, it becomes evident that the net electrostatic component, which is the combined effect of electrostatic (\u0394E elec ) and polar solvation free energy (\u0394G pol ) was unfavorable towards ligand binding. Overall, the Van der Waals (\u0394E vd w ) forces predominantly govern the binding process.\n**4\u2033-C 16 EGCG inhibits the S-palmitoylation of glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) protein**\nTo confirm if 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG inhibits acylation of proteins, we  \n**Table 3**\nFree energy components values (kcal/mol) for DHHC20-ligand complexes. Data are represented as average \u00b1 SEM.  [69]. Interestingly, we were able to successfully observe a decrease in GAPDH pull down in protein lysates obtained from metabolically labelled HeLa cells pretreated with 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG comparison to Alk-14 treatment alone (Fig. 9). These results validate our findings that 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG can inhibit the S-palmitoylation of endogenous proteins.\n\n**Conclusion**\nProtein S-palmitoylation is mediated by writer and eraser enzymes, known as DHHCs and APTs respectively. The reversible nature of this modification uniquely qualifies it for the development of therapeutical strategies to combat different pathophysiological conditions. Among the very few known inhibitors of DHHC, 2-BP has been widely used. However, it is known for its off-targets including fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, acyl-CoA synthetase etc. Thus, there is a pressing demand to identify potent DHHC inhibitors. This study explores the potential of EGCG, an active polyphenol found in the green tea to inhibit the S-palmitoylation of proteins by introducing structural modifications in it. The global S-palmitoylation level of proteins were inhibited by 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG in HEK 293T cells whereas both 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG, and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG inhibited the protein palmitoylation in HeLa cells. 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG effectively inhibited the S-palmitoylation in DHHC3overexpressing HEK 293T cells. Our confocal data provided an insightful view on the extensive and widely distributed spatial and temporal arrangement of S-palmitoylated proteins in cancer cells such as HeLa and MCF-7 cells, and further showed the efficacy of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG, and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG in inhibiting protein S-palmitoylation. Both 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG, and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG reduced the levels of S-palmitoylation of proteins to the basal levels. Our in-silico analysis successfully exhibited high binding affinity of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG, and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG towards DHHC20. The driving force for these interactions was mainly associated with the positioning of alkyl chain into the hydrophobic cleft formed by the transmembrane domains of the enzyme. The alkyl chain was seen to form various noncovalent interactions with important amino residues present inside the hydrophobic cleft of the enzyme. These interactions were mainly responsible for bringing the EGCG part of the inhibitors in close proximity to the catalytic cysteine in the enzyme. In fact, our molecular dynamics simulations also suggested that Van der Waals forces accounted for major part of binding affinity values obtained. We were also able to show that 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG was also able to inhibit the S-palmitoylation of GAPDH protein. Taken together, our in vitro and in silico data strongly support the inhibitory effect of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG, and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG against DHHC enzymes, and they can act as a complimentary tool to investigate protein S-palmitoylation.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement S.S. conceived and supervised the study; A.B., M.K., and R.S performed experiments and data analysis; S.P. and P.K. performed the MD simulation studies; all the authors wrote the manuscript.  \n\n\nS-palmitoylation is a dynamic lipid-based protein post-translational modification facilitated by a family of protein acyltransferases (PATs) commonly known as DHHC-PATs or DHHCs. It is the only lipid modification that is reversible, and this very fact uniquely qualifies it for therapeutic interventions through the development of DHHC inhibitors. Herein, we report that 4\u2033-alkyl ether lipophilic derivatives of EGCG can effectively inhibit protein S-palmitoylation in vitro. With the help of metabolic labeling followed by copper(I)-catalyzed azidealkyne cycloaddition Click reaction, we demonstrate that 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG markedly inhibited Spalmitoylation in various mammalian cells including HEK 293T, HeLa, and MCF-7 using both in gel fluorescence as well as confocal microscopy. Further, these EGCG derivatives were able to attenuate the S-palmitoylation to the basal level in DHHC3-overexpressed cells, suggesting that they are plausibly targeting DHHCs. Confocal microscopy data qualitatively reflected spatial and temporal distribution of S-palmitoylated proteins in different sub-cellular compartments and the inhibitory effects of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG were clearly observed in the native cellular environment. Our findings were further substantiated by in silico analysis which revealed promising binding affinity and interactions of 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG with key amino acid residues present in the hydrophobic cleft of the DHHC20 enzyme. We also demonstrated the successful inhibition of Spalmitoylation of GAPDH by 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG. Taken together, our in vitro and in silico data strongly suggest that 4\u2033-C 14 EGCG and 4\u2033-C 16 EGCG can act as potent inhibitors for S-palmitoylation and can be employed as a complementary tool to investigate S-palmitoylation.\n\n",
