    "abstract": "Membrane fusion is a critical component of the viral lifecycle. For SARS-CoV-2, fusion is facilitated by the spike glycoprotein and can take place via either the plasma membrane or the endocytic pathway. The fusion domain (FD), which is found within the spike glycoprotein, is primarily responsible for the initiation of fusion as it embeds itself within the target cell's membrane. A preference for SARS-CoV-2 to fuse at low pH akin to the environment of the endocytic pathway has already been established; however, the impact of the target cell's lipid composition on the FD has yet to be explored. Here, we have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 FD preferentially initiates fusion at the late endosomal membrane over the plasma membrane, on the basis of lipid composition alone. A positive, fusogenic relationship with anionic lipids from the plasma membrane (POPS: 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine) and endosomal membrane (BMP: bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate) was established, with a large preference demonstrated for the latter. When comparing the binding affinity and secondary structure of the FD in the presence of different anionic lipids, little deviation was evident while the charge was maintained. However, it was discovered that BMP had a subtle, negative impact on lipid packing in comparison to that of POPS. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between lipid packing and the fusogenecity of the SARS-CoV-2 FD was witnessed. In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 FD preferentially initiates fusion at a membrane resembling that of the late endosomal compartment, predominately due to the presence of BMP and its impact on lipid packing.\n"
