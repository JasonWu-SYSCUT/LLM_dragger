Here, we show that the anti-oxidant protein peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) interacts with and depalmitoylates PLM in a glutathione-dependent manner. Glutathione loading cells acutely reduce PLM palmitoylation; glutathione depletion significantly increases PLM palmitoylation. Prdx6 silencing abolishes these effects, suggesting that PLM can be depalmitoylated by reduced Prdx6. In vitro, only recombinant Prdx6, among several peroxiredoxin isoforms tested, removes palmitic acid from recombinant palmitoylated PLM. The broad-spectrum depalmitoylase inhibitor palmostatin B prevents Prdx6-dependent PLM depalmitoylation in cells and in vitro. Our data suggest that Prdx6 is a thioesterase that can depalmitoylate proteins by nucleophilic attack via its reactive thiol, linking PLM palmitoylation and hence sodium pump activity to cellular glutathione status.

    "fullText": "**INTRODUCTION**\nThe reversible acylation of cysteine residues of proteins via a thioester bond between the sulfhydryl side chain and the fatty acid palmitate (palmitoylation) regulates membrane association, subcellular location, trafficking, turnover rate, and enzymatic activity of both peripheral and integral membrane proteins. 1 Palmitoylation is achieved enzymatically via the activity of a family of transferase enzymes that have a zinc-finger-containing Asp-His-His-Cys (zDHHC) motif in their active site. 2,3 To date, relatively few palmitate-removing thioesterases have been identified: known depalmitoylases include acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1), 4,5 APT2, 4,6 palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), 7 and certain members of the ab-hydrolase (ABHD) serine hydrolase family of enzymes. 8,9 The discoveries that ABHD17 depalmitoylates N-ras 10 and post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) 9 and that ABHD10 depalmitoylates Prdx5 11 suggest that the breadth of depalmitoylating enzymes is much greater than has been appreciated to date. Although the palmitoylation of most proteins turns over slowly, some proteins are rapidly palmitoylated and depalmitoylated. 8 The type 1 integral membrane protein phospholemman (PLM) regulates the ubiquitous sodium/potassium ATPase (Na pump) in excitable tissues such as cardiac muscle by modifying its substrate affinity and maximum transport rate. 12 Phosphorylation of PLM by protein kinase A (PKA) and PKC activates the pump 13 ; palmitoylation of cysteines adjacent to the lipid bilayer by zDHHC5 inhibits the pump. [14][15][16] Although PLM phosphorylation enhances its palmitoylation, 14 the mechanisms underlying PLM depalmitoylation remain undetermined.\nIn this study, we have shown that PLM and peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) physically interact in cardiac myocytes. Prdx6 catalyzes the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, fatty acid hydroperoxides, and phospholipid hydroperoxides 17 in a two-step reaction in which the Prdx6 active-site nucleophilic cysteine is first oxidized and then regenerated using glutathione. 18 Furthermore, Prdx6 has phospholipase A2 activity and can bind phospholipids. 19 Here, we report that the Prdx6 active-site cysteine can also remove palmitate from PLM by nucleophilic attack of the thioester bond prior to the sulfhydryl group being regenerated in a glutathione-dependent manner. Hence, Prdx6 links the palmitoylation status of PLM to the redox (glutathione) status of the cell.\n\n**RESULTS**\n**PLM and Prdx6 physically associate in ventricular muscle**\nPreviously, using tandem mass spectrometry, we identified numerous proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with the cardiac Na pump complex. 20 Apart from the Na pump a subunit, relatively few of these proteins interacted directly with PLM. We sought to identify PLM-interacting proteins by treating digitonin-permeabilized rat ventricular myocytes with a series of homo-and hetero-bifunctional crosslinking reagents that had a variety of distances between their reactive groups and then immunoblotting the crosslinking reactions for PLM (Figure 1A). Sulfosuccinimidyl 6-[a-methyl-a-(2-pyridyldithio)toluamido]hexanoate (Sulfo-LC-SMPT; reactive toward sulfhydryls and primary amines; distance between reactive groups: 2 nm) quantitatively crosslinked PLM to a protein whose molecular weight was 20-25 kDa (as the crosslinked adduct had a gel mobility of ca. 37 kDa). The adduct was only recognized in immunoblots with antibodies raised against the extracellular, but not the intracellular, regions of PLM (Figure 1B), suggesting that the interaction between the unidentified protein and PLM occurs in the cytosol and masks the epitope in the PLM intracellular domain that the antibody against the PLM C-tail normally recognizes. We evaluated a variety of detergents (including Triton X-100, Na deoxycholate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS]) and found that crosslinking between PLM and the unidentified protein was abolished in their presence, suggesting that this protein-protein interaction cannot be studied by co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the crosslinked adduct was resistant to solubilization unless SDS was used, which prevented us from immunoprecipitating after crosslinking.\nIn separate experiments to identify PLM-interacting proteins, a yeast 2-hybrid screen based on the split-ubiquitin system was conducted in which full-length murine PLM fused to the C-terminal half of ubiquitin was used as bait and a murine adult heart cDNA library fused to the N-terminal half of ubiquitin was used as prey (Dualsystems Biotech). Among the potential PLM interactors identified, Prdx6 was chosen for further analysis and shown to bind directly to PLM in a pairwise interaction test. We therefore investigated whether the 37 kDa crosslinked adduct identified in myocytes was PLM bound to Prdx6. Figure 1C indicates that antibodies against PLM and Prdx6 both recognize the 37 kDa adduct. In myocytes treated with Sulfo-LC-SMPT, Prdx6 migrates at 25 (monomeric Prdx6), 37 (PLM-Prdx6 adduct), and 50 kDa (possibly Prdx6 crosslinked to its glutathione donor GST-p) (Figure 1C). A crosslinked sample was separated on a single-well gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, which was subsequently divided and separately probed for PLM and Prdx6 (Figure 1D). When the membrane was joined back together, the crosslinked adduct recognized by both the PLM and Prdx6 antibodies showed identical mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). We therefore concluded that the crosslinked adduct consisted of Prdx6 bound to PLM.\nThe interaction between PLM and Prdx6 is modified by glutathione loading in cells Next, we investigated whether the interaction between PLM and Prdx6 in ventricular myocytes could be modified by promoting either PLM phosphorylation or Prdx6 oxidation. Figure 1E indicates that the phosphorylation status of PLM does not modify its interaction with Prdx6. Furthermore, the PLM-Prdx6 interaction was not affected by treatment of cells with either exogenous hydrogen peroxide (an oxidizing agent) or the free radical scavenger mercaptopropionyl glycine (an anti-oxidant) (Figure 1E). However, we did find that treating cells with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) abolished the interaction between PLM and Prdx6. NAC is a cell-permeable form of cysteine that increases cellular levels of glutathione, as cysteine availability is the rate-limiting step in glutathione synthesis. 21,22 Unlike the other members of the Prdx family, whose physiological reductant is thioredoxin, Prdx6 utilizes glutathione. 17 Therefore, we hypothesized that the effect of increasing cellular glutathione levels via NAC promoted the activity of PLM-bound Prdx6 toward PLM changing either the structure and/or function of the PLM C-tail, causing Prdx6 to dissociate from it. As Prdx6 is a cellular reducing agent, 17 we first investigated whether Prdx6 bound to PLM protected either the Na pump complex or its locality from oxidative stress. However, we found no evidence that the presence of Prdx6 protected either PLM or the Na pump a subunit from direct oxidation (by assessing reactive cysteine availability with biotinylated iodoacetamide 23 ) or modification by oxidized lipids (by measuring protein carbonyl content with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine).\nManipulating cellular glutathione levels modifies the palmitoylation status of PLM in a Prdx6-dependent manner We investigated palmitoylation of PLM in enzymatically dispersed rat ventricular myocytes by resin-assisted capture of acylated proteins (acyl-RAC) followed by quantitative immunoblotting. Glutathione-loading myocytes (using NAC or cell-permeable glutathione ethyl ester) acutely decreased palmitoylation of PLM but not the caveolar structural protein caveolin 3 (Figure 2A). A similar effect was observed when FT-293 cells engineered to express PLM tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were glutathione loaded with NAC (Figure 2B). The effect of glutathione depletion on PLM palmitoylation was assessed by treating the PLM-YFP FT-293 stable cell line with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; 100 mM, overnight), which inhibits the first enzyme in glutathione biosynthesis g-glutamylcysteine synthase. Figure 2C shows that depletion of cellular glutathione in cultured cells caused enhanced palmitoylation of PLM.\nThe thioesterases identified to date (APT1, APT2, PPT1, ABHD17, ABHD10) are all serine hydrolases; other members of this protein family have also been suggested to have thioesterase activity. 8 The nucleophilic active-site serine of these hydrolases attacks the thioester bond linking palmitate to cysteine to facilitate protein depalmitoylation. We considered that the pKa of the nucleophilic cysteine in the active site of Prdx6 (C47, pKa 6.3 19 ) might also be sufficiently low to facilitate the transfer of palmitate from PLM to Prdx6. Since regeneration of the Prdx6 active site is glutathione dependent, we explored the possibility that the effect of manipulating cellular glutathione on PLM palmitoylation is mediated by altering the rate of regeneration of the Prdx6 sulfhydryl group following depalmitoylation of PLM. Figure 2D shows that the glutathione-loading-dependent decrease in PLM palmitoylation in FT-293 cells is abolished following small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of Prdx6, identifying Prdx6 as the glutathione ''sensor'' responsible for this effect.\n**Palmitate transfer from PLM to Prdx6**\nTo determine whether transfer of palmitate from PLM to Prdx6 occurs, we reconstituted the recombinant GST-tagged intracel-lular region of PLM and His-tagged wild-type and C47S Prdx6 in vitro. GST-PLM was acylated by incubation with 17-octadecynoic acid (ODYA) co-enzyme A (CoA). The acylated GST-PLM was then biotinylated by reaction of the alkyne-containing 17-ODYA with biotin azide in a copper (I)-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition. 24 Biotinylation of GST-PLM was hydroxylamine sensitive (Figure 3A), confirming that the click reaction reported protein acylation.\nIncubation of in-vitro-acylated GST-PLM with Prdx6 led to transfer of the biotinylated acyl moiety to wild-type, but not C47S, Prdx6 (Figure 3A), indicating that palmitate transfer between these proteins is possible and requires the active-site cysteine of Prdx6. We considered the possibility that either glutathione alone or DTT (the reducing agent used to protect the prdx6 active-site cysteine during protein preparation) participated in the in vitro PLM deacylation reaction. In-vitro-acylated GST-PLM was reacted with cyanine5.5 azide and incubated with wild-type prdx6, glutathione, or DTT. Only prdx6 deacylated GST-PLM in these experiments (Figure 3B). Furthermore, a small proportion of Prdx6 was found to be palmitoylated in rat ventricular myocytes (Figure 3C). Transient expression of wild-type and C47S Prdx6 in HEK cells confirmed that the active-site cysteine in Prdx6 can be palmitoylated (Figure 3D).\nTo determine whether the low pKa of the Prdx6 active-site cysteine (C47) was required for it to be palmitoylated, R132, which makes a major contribution to stabilizing the C47 thiolate anion, 25 was mutated to both Ala (aliphatic side chain) and Glu (negative charge). Neutralizing (R132A) or reversing (R132E) the positive charge of R132 in the Prdx6 active site prevented C47 from becoming palmitoylated (Figure 3D), indicating that Prdx6 palmitoylation required the active-site cysteine to have a low pKa.\n**Palmostatin B inhibits palmitate transfer from PLM to Prdx6**\nMost depalmitoylating enzymes (thioesterases) that have been identified to date are inhibited by palmostatin B. We considered the possibility that PLM may also be depalmitoylated by other thioesterase enzymes. Although acute application of palmostatin B did not alter basal levels of PLM palmitoylation, it did abolish the impact of glutathione loading on PLM palmitoylation (Figure 3E). We also found that palmostatin B blocked the transfer of palmitate from PLM to Prdx6 in vitro (Figure 3F) and therefore concluded that palmostatin B is an inhibitor of Prdx6 depalmitoylation activity.\n**Quantitative proteomic analysis of the effect of glutathione loading on protein palmitoylation in rat ventricular myocytes**\nWe investigated the impact of glutathione loading on palmitoylation of all proteins in freshly dispersed rat ventricular myocytes using a quantitative proteomic approach employing isobaric tags (iTraq 26 ) to compare the relative abundance of proteins purified by acyl-RAC from untreated and NAC-treated cells. As assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, the complement of palmitoylated proteins was not grossly different between control and NAC-treated rat myocytes (Figure 4A) nor mouse hearts that had been perfused with NAC and subjected to fatty acyl biotin exchange (FAE; Figure 4B). iTraq analysis showed that the vast majority of the 751 identified palmitoylated proteins in rat cardiac myocytes had the same relative palmitoylation following glutathione loading (representative target proteins are shown in Fig- ure 4C). However, a small number of proteins whose relative palmitoylation was reduced by glutathione loading were identified, most notably cavins 2 (serum deprivation-response protein [SDPR]) and 4 (muscle-related coiled-coil protein [MURC]) as well as myosin heavy chain isoform 6 (uppermost protein band marked in Fig- ure 4A). In contrast, several proteins showed enhanced palmitoylation following glutathione loading (e.g., clathrin heavy chain; Figure 4C), suggesting that glutathione inhibits their depalmitoylation. Full proteomic data are recorded in Table S1.\n**Prdx6 is the only cytoplasmic peroxiredoxin with thioesterase activity**\nWe evaluated the ability of recombinant peroxiredoxins to acquire palmitate from both palmitoylated proteins in cell lysates and in-vitro-acylated GST-PLM. HEK cells were loaded with 17-ODYA and palmitoylated proteins visualized by reaction with cyanine5.5 azide (Figure 5A). Cell lysates were incubated with different His-tagged peroxiredoxins, which were subsequently purified by Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography. Transfer of palmitate from acylated proteins in the cell lysates to the recombinant peroxiredoxins was evaluated by SDS-PAGE and in-gel fluorescence (Figure 5B). Wild-type Prdx6 acquired palmitate from the cell lysates but not C47S Prdx6, Prdx1, nor Prdx2, suggesting that the ability to depalmitoylate proteins is unique to Prdx6 among peroxiredoxin isoforms. Similarly, only recombinant wild-type Prdx6 acquired palmitate from in-vitro-acylated GST-PLM (Figure 5C).\n\n**DISCUSSION**\nHere, we describe the transfer of palmitate from the cardiac phosphoprotein PLM to the anti-oxidant protein Prdx6 through a nucleophilic transfer reaction involving the active-site cysteine of Prdx6, the regeneration of which is glutathione dependent. We suggest that cellular events in which palmitate is transferred between proteins, including both protein palmitoylation and depalmitoylation reactions, may be favored simply because the pKa of the recipient cysteine is lower than that of the donor.\nThe ability of a peptide cysteine thiolate anion to cleave the thioester bond in palmitoyl CoA has long been known. 27 This present study demonstrates that thioester bonds linking palmitate groups to cysteine sulfhydryl groups on proteins are also vulnerable to cleavage by thiolate ions in other proteins, suggesting that any nucleophilic active center may depalmitoylate via this mechanism. Although all thioesterases identified to date have active-site nucleophilic serines, our results suggest that depalmitoylating enzymes do not necessarily require such a serine. A reaction scheme suggested by the experimental data is presented in Figure 6.\nThe transfer of palmitate to a nucleophilic recipient cysteine is highly similar to the transthiolation reactions that occur between E1, E2, and E3 ubiquitin ligases. In that context, the active-site cysteine of an E1 ubiquitin ligase binds ubiquitin via a thioester bond. Transfer of ubiquitin to the E2 ligase is ATP independent and relies on nucleophilic attack of this thioester bond by the active-site cysteine of the E2 ligase. 28 Specificity of ubiquitin transfer is achieved by protein-protein interactions between E1, E2, and E3 ligases akin to that observed here between Prdx6 and PLM.\nAmong the cellular events regulated by Prdx6, it has previously been shown to interact with both k opioid receptors and Gai in a JNK-dependent fashion to regulate opioid receptor sensitivity/ tolerance. 29 Prdx6 activity in this context was thought to reduce Gai palmitoylation via increased free radical production rather than direct depalmitoylation. Nevertheless, the observations of Schattauer and colleagues are consistent with the possibility of Prdx6 functioning as a thioesterase. Interestingly, glutathione supplementation also reduces Gaq palmitoylation in the context of wound healing, 30 suggesting that glutathione-dependent depalmitoylation may also occur in other physiological contexts.\nAs increasing cellular levels of glutathione increased the rate of PLM depalmitoylation, it suggests that glutathione availability is a rate-determining step in this reaction. Regeneration of the Prdx6 active-site cysteine is dependent first on the glutathione donor GST-p1, which glutathionylates Prdx6 C47, and then the spontaneous reduction of glutathionylated Prdx6 by free cellular glutathione. 18,31,32 Hence, both steps in the regeneration of Prdx6 are glutathione dependent. This, and the relatively low affinity of GST-p1 for glutathione, 18,31 probably explains how supra-physiological concentrations of cellular glutathione increase the rate of both Prdx6 regeneration and PLM depalmitoylation.\n**Redox regulation of the Na pump**\nThe relationship between Prdx6 and PLM establishes a link between the palmitoylation status of PLM and the redox (glutathione) status of the cell. The redox sensitivity of the cardiac Na pump is well established 33,34 ; notably, the cardiac Na pump is rapidly inhibited upon glutathione depletion, 33 but the molecular basis of this effect has remained unclear. As PLM palmitoylation inhibits the Na pump, 14 we propose that glutathionesensitive depalmitoylation of PLM by Prdx6 acts as a redox sensor for the pump, reducing its activity at times of oxidative stress. Palmitoylation of PLM turns over quickly: we have previously reported phosphorylation-induced palmitoylation within 10 min of agonist application, 14 and in the present study, manipulating cellular glutathione results in changes within 60 min. As the pump is a major consumer of cellular ATP, its acute inhibition at times of glutathione depletion may protect cardiomyocytes against precipitous ATP depletion and possible cell death. PLM palmitoylation will also prevent terminal cysteine oxidation at times of cellular redox stress.\n**Palmitate transfer by Prdx6**\nAs well as being an anti-oxidant, Prdx6 has phospholipase A2 activity. 19 The lack of palmitate transfer to C47S Prdx6 indicates that the phospholipase and thioesterases activities of Prdx6 are distinct, as the Prdx6 phospholipase activity is conferred by a catalytic triad of residues consisting of H26, S32, and D140. 35 However, the lipid-binding properties of Prdx6 conferred by this triad are relevant for its targeting to caveolar microdomains 19 (in which PLM resides 20 ), and may also assist in targeting Prdx6 to palmitoylated PLM, because the interaction between the two is abolished following depalmitoylation of PLM. Prdx6 has also previously been shown to transfer palmitate to lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC). 36 It is, therefore, conceivable that the palmitate that Prdx6 receives from PLM is subsequently transferred to lysoPC.\n**Wider implications**\nA significant proportion of palmitoylated cysteines are low-pKa nucleophiles. 37,38 Palmitoylation by zDHHC protein acyltransferases (zDHHC-PATs) may therefore be achieved as a result of nucleophilic palmitate transfer from the DHHC motif to the substrate protein, much as we report here from PLM to Prdx6. This is consistent with a paradigm in which the specificity of a palmitoylation/depalmitoylation reaction is achieved by a protein-protein interaction and the movement of palmitate itself by a nucleophilic transfer controlled by the pKa of the recipient thiol.\nEmerging data support the concept that zDHHC-PAT substrate specificity is determined by protein-protein interactions involving regions of the enzyme far removed from their active site. 15,[39][40][41] Limitations of the study Although considerable evidence has been provided demonstrating that Prdx6 depalmitoylates PLM, it is not yet clear whether Prdx6 is a specific thioesterase that only depalmitoylates PLM or if it has activity toward other palmitoylated proteins.\nWhen the effect of glutathione loading on protein palmitoylation in rat ventricular myocytes was investigated using quantitative proteomics, several proteins whose relative palmitoylation was reduced by glutathione loading were identified, including cavins 2 (SDPR) and 4 (MURC) as well as myosin heavy chain isoform 6. Further experiments will be required to determine whether the observed reduction in palmitoylation that occurred on glutathione loading was mediated via Prdx6. Furthermore, in the quantitative proteomics experiment, several proteins were found to have enhanced palmitoylation following glutathione loading such as clathrin heavy chain, suggesting that glutathione may inhibit their depalmitoylation. The molecular basis of this observation currently remains unexplored.   \n**Article**\nPrdx1 and Prdx2 were expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells (induction conditions: 0.5 mM IPTG, 2h at 37 C) and purified using nickelsepharose.\nIn vitro palmitoylation 17-ODYA CoA was synthesized from 17-ODYA (1 mM) and CoA (5 mM) by acyl CoA synthetase (10 mUnits/mL) in the presence of 10 mM ATP for 60 min at 37 C. Recombinant GST-PLM was immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads and acylated by incubation with 17-ODYA CoA or Palmitoyl Alkyne-Coenzyme A for 30 min at 37 C. Unreacted fatty acyl CoA was removed by washing the beads 5 times in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and acylated GST-PLM was biotinylated by copper (I) catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition in the presence of 1 mM TCEP, 1 mM CuSO 4 , 0.1 mM TBTA and 0.1 mM biotin azide in 50 mM TRIS pH 8.0 and 1% Triton X-100. Beads were washed 5 times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The hydroxylamine-sensitivity of biotin incorporation confirms that it reports acylation of GST-PLM. GST was not acylated by the same protocol. In some experiments biotin azide was replaced with cyanine 5.5 azide, and acylation visualized using in-gel fluorescence.\nPrior to reconstitution with acylated biotinylated GST-PLM, His-tagged wild type and C47S Prdx6 were reduced by incubation with 10 mM DTT in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The final concentration of dithiothreitol (DTT) in the transfer reaction was 1 mM. Reactions proceeded for 30 min at 37 C, and were quenched by addition of SDS PAGE loading buffer and immediately separated using SDS PAGE, transferred, and probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (strep-HRP).\n**Quantitative proteomics**\nPalmitoylated proteins were purified from control and glutathione-loaded rat ventricular myocytes by acyl-RAC, and eluted in Laemmli buffer supplemented with 100 mM DTT. Proteins were subjected to SDS PAGE for 1 cm, Coomassie stained, excised as a single band, subjected to in gel digestion, labeled with isobaric tags (iTraq), separated by cation exchange into 10 fractions, and analyzed by mass spectrometry on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro (Thermo) at the FingerPrints Proteomics Unit, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee. Peptides were matched and assigned using Mascot with a minimum 2 peptides with ion score >34 required for identification. For analysis, rat IPI identifiers supplied by Mascot were mapped to human Uniprot identifiers using a custom-built IPI to Uniprot dictionary. iTraq ratios for all proteins identified from glutathione-loaded cells relative to control cells are reported in Table S1.\n**Palmitate transfer**\nFT-293 cells were loaded overnight with 17-ODYA (20 mM) conjugated to fatty acid-free BSA. Cells were lyzed in 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mM TRIS pH 8.0, and palmitoylated proteins visualized by reaction with 20 mM cyanine5.5-azide in the presence of 2 mM CuSO 4 , 0.2 mM TBTA and 4 mM ascorbate. Lysates were spiked with His-tagged recombinant peroxiredoxins and 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol. Following incubation at 37 C for 60 min, the peroxiredoxins were purified using Ni-sepharose beads. Palmitoylated proteins were visualized after separation by SDS PAGE using in-gel fluorescence with a Li-COR infrared imaging system.\n**QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**\nQuantitative data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. One-way ANOVA analysis was performed on data that had one independent variable and one quantitative dependent variable (Figures 2A and2B, 2D; 3E). The Student's T test was used to compare mean values between 2 groups (Figure 2C).\nAll statistical analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism.
