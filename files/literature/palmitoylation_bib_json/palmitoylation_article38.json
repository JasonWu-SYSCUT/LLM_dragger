    "fullText": "**INTRODUCTION**\nFatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) is a frequent metabolic disorder in high-producing laying hens featuring hepatic fat accumulation and abnormal lipid metabolism, which can lead to acute mortality and a rapid decline in egg production, causing significant economic losses for the poultry industry. The development of FLHS is influenced by various factors, including environmental conditions, genetic predisposition, hormonal imbalances, nutritional factors, gut microbiota composition, and metabolic status (Wang et al., 2020). Currently, considerable progress has been made in comprehending FLHS, but the development of robust diagnostic and therapeutic strategies is still at an early stage (Guo et al., 2021;Meng et al., 2021;Liu et al., 2022). Further research and clinical trials are needed to establish more effective approaches for diagnosing and treating FLHS.\nRecently, evidence has revealed the vital role of the gut microbiota and associated bacterial metabolites in governing and regulating essential physiological processes and metabolic pathways in the human body (Fang et al., 2022;Palmn\u20ac as-B edard et al., 2022). Gut symbiotic bacteria generate short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) via the fermentation of indigestible dietary fibers, among which butyric acid emerges as a principal constituent in this metabolic pathway. Prior studies have shown that butyrate could be utilized as an energy source by colonocytes (Donohoe et al., 2011). Meanwhile, butyrate exerts multiple beneficial effects in mammals. These include the regulation of gut hormone secretion and the inhibition of pro-inflammatory factor 1 production (Lin et al., 2012;Matt et al., 2018). These effects are closely associated with the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in developing fatty liver disease. Recently, butyrate has been shown to activate the G protein-coupled receptors, GPR41 and GPR43, which have been implicated in regulating energy metabolism and immune function (Kimura et al., 2011;Chang et al., 2014;Byrne et al., 2015). In addition, sodium butyrate (NaB) can enhance peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa) mRNA transcription level and restore b-oxidation of fatty acids (FA) in the mice liver on a high-fat diet, thus reducing liver fat deposition (Sun, 2018). Numerous seemingly contradictory findings show sophisticated interactions between gut microbiota, butyrate content, and host immunity and metabolism (Qin et al., 2012;Zhang et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the intrinsic mechanisms by which butyrate regulates lipid metabolism in the liver have not been more thoroughly investigated.\nAMPK functions as an intracellular receptor and regulator of cellular energy, playing a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) regulates the activation of AMPK, which in turn influences the synthesis and breakdown of FA (Shaw et al., 2005). Activation of AMPK inhibits the dimerization of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), subsequently reducing its activity and impeding FA synthesis. Simultaneously, a decrease in malonyl coenzyme A (malonyl-CoA) values accelerates FA oxidation within the mitochondria (Munday et al., 1988;Cho et al., 2010). This process is controlled by PPARa, which detects fluctuations in the body's energy state and regulates FA utilization, ketone synthesis rates, and fat storage under low and high energy conditions. Additionally, PPARa is a factor in mitochondrial FA transport and regulation of b-oxidation (Hashimoto et al., 2000;Xu et al., 2002). Research has shown that PPARa can upregulate the expression of CPT1, CPT2, and carnitine acylcarnitine translocase (CACT), thereby enhancing lipolysis mediated by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels, and reducing the secretion of hepatic LPL inhibitor apolipoprotein C-III to improve LPL activity indirectly (Hertz et al., 1995;Schoonjans et al., 1996;Brandt et al., 1998). Consequently, AMPK and PPARa play crucial roles in sustaining the equilibrium of lipid metabolism. Activation of AMPK and PPARa using active substances may hold potential as targets for allied diseases.\nWe previously reported that aberrant activation of the AMPK/PPARa signaling channel, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, and reduced production of SCFA, particularly butyric acid, are associated with the development of FLHS (Gao et al., 2019;Huang et al., 2022;Zhou et al., 2022). Therefore, we hypothesize that supplementation of NaB alone could ameliorate lipid accumulation in the livers of FLHS. We further postulated that this amelioration could be linked to regulating crucial genes involved in FA metabolism, such as AMPK/ PPARa. Our results showed that butyrate effectively alleviates lipid accumulation and liver damage induced by FFA in primary chicken hepatocytes through modulation of the AMPK/PPARa signaling channel. Based on these findings, the prospective future of NaB is in mitigating steatohepatitis and positioning it as a promising therapeutic intervention for managing FLHS.\n\n**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\n**Cell Isolation, Culture, and Treatment**\nReferring to the previous culture method for isolation and bio-culture of primary chicken liver cells (Huang, 2019), the 12-day-old chicken embryo of Hy-Line Variety Brown layer chickens were taken for cell experiment in vitro. The livers were chopped into small portions (approximately 1 mm 3 ), washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 3 to 5 times, then digested with 0.1% collagenase at 37\u00b0C for 10 to 15 min. Digestion was terminated by additional Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco, CA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Bioind, Israeli). Hepatocytes were collected by filtration through 200-mesh and 500-mesh cell sieves and centrifugation at 4\u00b0C, 1,200 rpm for 5 min (Centrifuge 5810 R, Eppendorf, Germany). Hepatocytes were resuspended and diluted in serum-free medium (1 \u00a3 10 6 cells/mL), plated into tissue culture plates after cell counting, and then maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . All hepatocytes were gathered for subsequent experiments.\nThe first experiment (Exp1) examined the toxicity of NaB (Selleck, Houston, TX) in chicken hepatocytes. Cells were taken after 48 h of incubation in 96-well cell culture plates, washed twice, and added to serum-free medium pre-warmed to 37\u00b0C respectively containing 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mmol/L NaB. Six replicates were set up for each concentration, and the cells were treated for 24h. Our preliminary data supported the choice of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mmol/L doses for 24 h, showing remarkable efficacy while preserving adequate cell viability. Based on the previous study, a high-fat cell additive (containing 12 mmol/L sodium oleate (OA) and 6 mmol/L sodium palmitate (PA); Kunchuang, Xi'an, China) formulated as 1 mmol/L free fatty acids (FFA) (keeping the ratio of OA and PA concentrations at 2:1) was selected for the second experiment (Exp2) to establish hepatic steatosis model in primary hepatocytes.\nTo investigate the roles of AMPK and PPARa in NaB preventing steatosis of chicken hepatocytes, Comp C (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China) and GW6471 (Selleck), an ATP-competitive AMPK inhibitor and a selective PPARa antagonist, were separately used to inhibit AMPK and PPARa in chicken hepatocellular adipose degeneration model. Twenty-five milligram Comp C powder dissolved in 1.2516 mL DMSO to make a 50 mmol/L masterbatch; 10 mg GW6471 powder dissolved in 1.6138 mL DMSO to make a 10 mmol/L masterbatch. In the third experiment (Exp3), hepatocytes were cultured with/without 0.5 mol/L NaB, 1 mmol/L FFA, and 15 mmol/L Comp C, while others were cultured with/without 0.5 mol/L NaB, 1 mmol/L FFA, and 4 mmol/L GW6471. All hepatocytes were collected for subsequent experiments.\n**Calculating Cell Damage**\nThe Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) (Bimake, Charlotte, NC) served to determine the cell viability. The CCK-8 working solution was formulated at a ratio of 100:10, and 100 mL of the mixture was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h under dark conditions. The optical density (OD) was determined using a multimode reader (Molecular Devices, Shanghai, China), which was adjusted to 450 nm. Three independent runs of each experiment were performed.\n**Determination of Biochemical Indexes Related to Liver Fat Metabolism**\nAfter washing twice, the treated cells were scraped off and resuspended in 1 mL PBS. Following centrifugation of the cell suspension at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, the precipitate was taken and added to 300 mL of physiological saline, and the hepatocytes were completely fragmented using a homogenizer (Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Hepatocyte homogenates were measured for TG, total cholesterol (T-CHO), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using commercially available assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Institute of Bioengineering, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n**Chicken Hepatocytes Oil Red O Staining**\nChicken hepatocytes were fixed and stained according to the requirements of the oil red O staining kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). After the operation, the picture results were used in a microscope to observe and obtain. Microscopic examination showed that the red or orange-red substances were lipid droplets, and the nuclei were blue.\n**RNA Extraction and Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction**\nFollowing the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was extracted using the TransZol Up reagent (TransGen, Beijing, China), and measured with a GeneQuant 1300 spectrophotometer. Then the mRNA therein was reverse transcribed into cDNA using TransScript Uni All-in-One First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix for qPCR (One-Step gDNA Removal) (TransGen). Primers for the amplification of AMPKa1, PPARa, CPT1, sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), ACC, fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), liver X receptor a (LXRa), 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and b-Actin were designed by NCBI and synthesized by Tsingke Biotechnology Company (Beijing, China) (Table 1). The Real-time PC Detection System (Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch, Foster City, CA) was used to conduct real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction using ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). A hot start at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 s, and annealing/ extension at 60\u00b0C for 30 s made up the PCR protocol. Forty cycles were performed in total. b-Actin was used as a housekeeping gene, and the mRNA expression levels of related genes were analyzed using the 2 \u00c0DDCT approach.\n**Protein Extraction and Western Blot**\nProteins were detached from hepatocytes using a lysate (RIPA lysate: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride: phosphatase inhibitor = 100:1:1) (Solarbio), and protein consistency was assayed with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, Beijing, China). Western Blot was carried out as the method described previously (Zhuang et al., 2019), equal amounts of total cellular proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel Table 1. Sequence of target genes primer.\n**Gene names**\nGenBank accession no. Sequence of primer (5 0 -3 0 )\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by using primary antibodies as indicated, such as anti-AMP-activated protein kinase a1 (AMPKa1) (Bioss, Beijing, China), anti-p-AMPKa1 (Bioss), anti-PPARa (Proteintech, Wuhan, China), anti-carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A) (Bioss), anti-FASN (Proteintech), anti-SREBF1 (Proteintech). As a reference, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Servicebio) was applied. Corresponding secondary antibodies were also used, such as HRP-conjugated Affinipure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Proteintech) and HRPconjugated Affinipure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Proteintech). Detection was performed using an ECL chemiluminescent substrate (Abbkine, Wuhan, China). The strips were imaged on a Gel Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and ImageJ software was used to quantify the relative optical density of the bands.\n**Statistical Analyses**\nStatistical comparisons among groups were made by 1-way ANOVA with SPSS 25.0 and presented as mean \u00a7 standard deviation (mean \u00a7 SD). At last, data graphs were generated by GraphPad Prism 9 software. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05 and indicated as follows: ns P > 0.05; compared with the Con group, * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01; compared with the FFA group, # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01.\n\n**RESULTS**\n**Dysfunction of Lipid Metabolism Brought on by FFA Stimulation in Hepatocytes Can be Mitigated by NaB**\nHepatocyte cell viability was not dramatically altered following treatment with 0.5 to 1 mmol/L NaB (P > 0.05), whereas it significantly decreased hepatocyte activity at the concentration of 1.5 to 2 mmol/L (P < 0.01; Figure 1A). Treatment of hepatocytes with low, medium, and high concentrations of NaB, respectively, greatly reduced the large number of lipid droplets produced by FFA stimulation (P < 0.01; Figures 1B and1C). Meanwhile, FFA stimulation markedly enhanced the TG, T-CHO, HDL-C, and LDL-C contents among hepatocytes by comparison with the Control group (Con) (P < 0.01), and 0.25 to 1 mmol/L NaB treatment significantly inhibited the increasing of TG and LDL-C contents caused by FFA stimulation among hepatocytes (P < 0.01; Figure 1D). These discoveries demonstrated that NaB suppresses the excessive fat buildup among hepatocytes brought on by FFA activation.\nSodium Butyrate (NaB) Alters Elements involved in Lipid Metabolism and AMPK/PPARa Correlated Factors Manifestation within Hepatocytes Activated by FFA. Free fatty acids substantially enhanced the quantities of SREBF1, ACC1, LXRa and HMGR mRNA (P < 0.01; Fig- ures 2A, 2B, 2E, and2F), inhibited the quantities of AMPKa1 mRNA (P < 0.01; Figure 2G) and PPARa and CPT1 mRNA (P < 0.01; Figures 2H and2I) with respect to Con group. However, different concentrations of NaB all blocked the FFA-stimulated hepatocyte-induced increase in adipogenesis-related factors to varying degrees, and the effect was particularly significant in the mRNA expression of ACC1, FASN, and LXRa (P < 0.01; Figure 2A). Sodium butyrate addition increased the expression of AMPKa1 mRNA at least 1.8 folds in FFA-treated hepatocytes (P < 0.01; Figure 2B). In addition, the results showed that FFA activation of hepatocytes led to a decrease in the concentrations of p-AMPKa1, PPARa, and CPT1A proteins (P < 0.01; Figures 3A-3D) and an increase in the concentrations of SREBF1 and FASN proteins (P < 0.01; Figures 3A, 3E, and3F). Treatment with medium concentration of NaB resulted in significantly higher levels of p-AMPKa1, PPARa, and CPT1A proteins in FFA-treated hepatocytes (P < 0.01; Figures 3A-3D). But all 3 concentrations of NaB treatment resulted in a significant decrease in SREBF1 and FASN protein contents in FFA-treated hepatocytes (P < 0.01; Figures 3A, 3E, and3F).\n**Sodium Butyrate Ameliorates FFA-Induced Lipid Metabolism Disorders by AMPK Signaling**\nAs a critical regulator of maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy, the buildup of intracellular lipid droplets can be reduced by AMPK. Thus, hepatocytes were treated with the NaB, FFA, and AMPK inhibitor Comp C to examine the role of AMPK in alleviating lipid metabolism problems by NaB treatment. Oil red staining analysis showed that NaB treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of lipid droplets in FFA-stimulated hepatocytes (P < 0.01), whereas the addition of the AMPK inhibitor Comp C twice increased the number of lipid droplets when compared with that in the FFA + NaB group (P < 0.01; Figures 4A and4B); the similar results were seen in the TG content assay (P < 0.01; Figure 4C). Compound C (Comp C) further effectively downregulated p-AMPKa1 protein expression in FFA-stimulated hepatocytes (P < 0.01), but it did not lead to a decrease in p-AMPKa1 protein expression and an increase in SREBF1 protein expression in hepatocytes co-treated with NaB and FFA (P < 0.01; Figures 5A, 5B, and5E). However, the levels of PPARa and CPT1A proteins were significantly increased in hepatocytes induced by NaB with FFA (P < 0.01), whereas they were significantly decreased under Comp C treatment (P < 0.01; Figures 5A, 5C, and5D).\n**Sodium Butyrate Ameliorates FFA-Induced Lipid Metabolism-Related Problems by Activation of AMPK/PPARa Signaling**\nTo explore the role of PPARa in mitigating lipid metabolism disorders in NaB therapy, the hepatocytes were stimulated with NaB, FFA, and PPARa inhibitor GW6471. When contrasted to the Con group, FFA stimulation raised lipid droplet quantities (P < 0.01); NaB exposure effectively inhibited the FFA-induced increase in the number of lipid droplets in hepatocytes (P < 0.01), whereas the addition of GW6471 in turn increased the number of lipid droplets under both NaB and FFA treatments (P < 0.01; Figures 6A and6B). Similar outcomes were also observed when TG content was determined (P < 0.01; Figure 6C).\nSodium butyrate treatment increased the expression of PPARa and CPT1A proteins in FFA-stimulated hepatocytes (P < 0.01), whereas the expression of PPARa and CPT1A proteins decreased dramatically in hepatocytes after the addition of FFA, NaB, and GW6471 (P < 0.01; Figures 7A, 7C, and7D). Under treatment with GW6471, NaB treatment still led to an upregulation of p-AMPKa1 protein expression among FFA-induced hepatocytes (P < 0.01; Figures 7A and7B). Consistent with prediction, GW6471 inhibited the down-regulation of SREBF1 protein expression under NaB and FFA treatment (P < 0.01; Figures 7A and7E). Combining the previous results, NaB might ameliorate chicken hepatocyte steatosis through the AMPK/ PPARa signaling pathway. \n\n**DISCUSSION**\nFatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome is a common metabolic disorder characterized by hepatic fat accumulation and cellular steatosis, which can lead to sudden death and a dramatic decline in egg production among adult laying hens (Zhuang et al., 2019). Butyrate, a SCFA formed by microbial fermentation, has been shown to positively affect energy metabolism in skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and pancreatic b-cells (Ji et al., 2019). Previous reports have suggested that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and reduced production of SCFA, especially butyric acid, may be associated with FLHS incidence (Yang et al., 2023). Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether butyric acid can regulate lipid metabolism in chicken liver and alleviate hepatocellular steatosis, thus serve as a means of preventing or treating FLHS in the future. The current work demonstrated that NaB has a practical protective effect against FFA-induced hepatic steatosis in primary chicken hepatocytes and identified its mechanism of action in hepatocytes, which is expected to serve as a new approach to alleviate hepatic lipid deposition and prevent FLHS.\nNormal hepatic lipid metabolism is particularly important in peak laying hens. While disorders of hepatic lipid metabolism are characterized by elevated TG levels, increased lipoproteins and cellular steatosis. A multitude of investigators have effectively developed in vitro research models to induce hepatic steatosis by applying an excess of FFA (Ricchi et al., 2009;Lin et al., 2020). Our recent study showed that the administration of a blend of FFA, composed of OA and PA in a ratio of 2:1, 1 mmol/L as a concentration, significantly induced steatosis in primary chicken hepatocytes after a 24-h treatment characterized by increased levels of TG, T-CHO, HDL-C, and LDL-C, which consistency with previously studies. A study showed that NaB could alleviate hepatic steatosis, improve lipid profile, and enhance liver function primarily by activating the LKB1-AMPK-INSIG signaling pathway (Zhao et al., 2021). In the current investigation, after FFA induction, the treatment with 0.25 to 1 mmol/L of NaB dramatically boosted cell viability and lowered the increase in TG content.\nThe dynamic balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis is controlled by fundamental lipid metabolism variables (Saponaro et al., 2015). During the liposynthesis phase, the transcription factor SREBF1 controls the expression of genes related to FA and cholesterol synthesis in the cell (Ferr e and Foufelle, 2010;Saponaro et al., 2015). Previous studies have shown that SREBP-1(-/-) (SREBF1) mice have reduced mRNA expression levels of both FA and TG synthesis-related enzymes, such as ACC and FASN (Liang et al., 2002;Stoeckman and Towle, 2002).Recent studies have indicated an elevation in the levels of liver fat synthesis factors (such as ACC, FASN, mRNA and proteins expression) in vitro and in vivo models of fatty liver (Wang et al., 2017). Concurrently, in our current study, FFA stimulation showed significant increases in SREBF1 and FASN mRNA and proteins expression levels, whereas the addition of NaB resulted in a decrease in the expression levels of the 2 fat synthesis-related genes and proteins, suggesting that NaB inhibits the FFA-induced increase in fat synthesis. Additionally, we have observed that NaB can promote the expression of FA oxidation genes like PPARa and limit the expression of FA synthesis rate-limiting enzyme genes like ACC. Previous research has revealed that inhibiting ACC activity can decrease intracellular levels of malonyl-CoA, thereby activating FA b-oxidation, including increased PPARa and CPT1 expression (Kim et al., 2017). Therefore, our data demonstrate that NaB alleviates FFA-induced lipid metabolism disorders     in hepatocytes by inhibiting lipogenesis and promoting lipolysis.\nIt has been demonstrated that the AMPK and PPARa signaling pathways can modulate the expression and activity of critical enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, such as ACC, FASN, and CPT1 (Wang et al., 2020). Our experimental results indicate that NaB can enhance the regulation of AMPK and PPARa, essential factors in FA synthesis and oxidation. As a vital cellular energy sensor, AMPK is necessary for controlling the body's inflammatory reactions, oxidative stress, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Targeting AMPK has been constituted as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating and preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mammals. By regulating the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis, triglyceride production, reverse cholesterol transport, lipolysis, and FA oxidation, PPAR also plays a variety of roles in lipid metabolism. Activation of PPARa can be an essential pharmacological approach to alleviate fatty liver and type 2 diabetes (Okada-Iwabu et al., 2013;Pawlak et al., 2015). Conversely, inhibition of PPARa exacerbates hepatic lipid synthesis (Zhang et al., 2021). In the present study, our data suggested that inhibiting AMPK and PPARa can prevent the beneficial effect of NaB on FFA-induced lipid deposition in liver cells. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that NaB could alleviate hepatic lipid disorders, intestinal inflammation, and other pathologic features by regulating the AMPK and PPARa signaling pathways (Hong et al., 2016;Sun et al., 2018). However, the relationship between AMPK and PPARa is complex, particularly in poultry, and has not been extensively studied. Previous studies have shown that AMPK is required to activate PPARa in mice (Luo et al., 2022). Additionally, studies have found that activated PPARa can enhance AMPK expression (Bordoloi et al., 2019). In the present study, inhibiting AMPK activation with Comp C effectively counteracts the impact of NaB on PPARa protein expression. Interestingly, inhibiting PPARa with GW6471 does not disrupt the activation of the AMPK signaling pathway mediated by NaB. These findings suggest that NaB modulates hepatic lipid metabolism by regulating the interplay between the AMPK and PPARa signaling pathways.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\nIn summary, NaB promotes fatty acid oxidation and inhibits lipid synthesis in the FFA-induced chicken hepatocellular adipose degeneration model targeting the AMPK/PPARa pathway. Attempts to generate novel therapies for metabolic diseases like FLHS via AMPK/ PPARa activation by NaB may be worthy of pursuit.\n\n\nFatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) is a prevalent metabolic disorder observed in egg-laying hens, characterized by fatty deposits and cellular steatosis in the liver. Our preliminary investigations have revealed a marked decrease in the concentration of butyric acid in the FLHS strain of laying hens. It has been established that sodium butyrate (NaB) protects against metabolic disorders. However, the underlying mechanism by which butyrate modulates hepato-lipid metabolism to a great extent remains unexplored. In this study, we constructed an isolated in vitro model of chicken primary hepatocytes to induce hepatic steatosis by free fatty acids (FFA). Our results demonstrate that treatment with NaB effectively mitigated FFA-induced hepatic steatosis in chicken hepatocytes by inhibiting lipid accumulation, downregulating the mRNA expression of lipo-synthesisrelated genes (sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), liver X receptor a (LXRa), 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR)) (P < 0.05), and upregulating the mRNA and protein expression of AMP-activated protein kinase a1 (AMPKa1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa), and carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A) (P < 0.05). Moreover, AMPK and PPARa inhibitors (Compound C (Comp C) and GW6471, respectively) reversed the protective effects of NaB against FFA-induced hepatic steatosis by blocking the AMPK/ PPARa pathway, leading to lipid droplet accumulation and triglyceride (TG) contents in chicken primary hepatocytes. With these findings, NaB can alleviate hepatocyte lipoatrophy injury by activating the AMPK/PPARa pathway, promoting fatty acid oxidation, and reducing lipid synthesis in chicken hepatocytes, potentially being able to provide new ideas for the treatment of FLHS.\n\n",
