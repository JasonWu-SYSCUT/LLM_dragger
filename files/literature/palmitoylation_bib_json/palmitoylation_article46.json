    "fullText": "**Introduction**\nLIHC was also the sixth most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death globally in 2018 [1][2][3]. \u03b1-Fetal proteins (AFPs) are important criteria for the diagnosis and prognosis of liver cancer [4]. However, its accuracy is suboptimal due to the interference of many non-LIHC-related factors [5]. Therefore, to better treat LIHC patients, it is necessary to screen biomarkers that can predict prognosis as early as possible.\nPosttranslational modifications (PTMs) of proteins refer to chemical modifications of proteins after translation. PTMs may change intracellular signal transduction, metabolism, and gene regulation networks by regulating the stability and localization of proteins and the interactions between proteins and other biological macromolecules (including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids), thus regulating a variety of cellular functions [6,7]. In normal cells, PTMs may accurately and rapidly regulate cell proliferation, thus determining the cell state (quiescence or proliferation) [8]. In cancer cells, PTMs may lead to abnormal proliferation of tumor cells by regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle-related effector proteins and providing continuous proliferation signals [9,10]. Hundreds of PTMs have been discovered, and their main forms include phosphorylation, glycosylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and acylation [11]. Among them, protein acylation represents an important posttranslational modification [12]. Lapidated proteins are usually closely related to nonpolar structures such as lipid bilayers, which significantly increase the hydrophobicity of proteins and thus regulate their conformation, membrane binding, localization, and diffusion [13,14]. Therefore, in both tumor cells and normal cells, protein acylation plays an important role in cell proliferation and metabolism.\nProtein acylation mainly includes prenylation, N myristylation, and palmitoylation, while protein S-palmitoylation is the only completely reversible protein acylation modification [15,16]. S-palmitoylation means that the fatty acid and the sulfhydryl group of cysteine are connected by a thioester bond, which may influence the structure, assembly, maturation, transportation and function of proteins, thereby regulating membrane receptors, ion channels, cell adhesion and other physiological processes [17,18]. In mammalian cells, s-palmitoylation is regulated by a family of 23 zinc-finger Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) domain (ZDHHC) protein acyltransferases (PATs) [19]. To analyze the role of palmitoylation metabolism in LIHC, a comprehensive analysis of key ZDHHC families and regulatory genes was necessary.\nIn this study, we constructed palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters with different prognostic and immune features depending on palmitoylation metabolism-related genes (PMGs). PMS was constructed and facilitated to explore the prognostic features of LIHC. The palmitoylation metabolism prognostic model had distinct prognostic, mutational, and immune features. In addition, we further evaluated the immune and clinicopathological characteristics of ZDHHC20, a key gene in palmitoylation metabolism.\n\n**Methods**\n**Data acquisition and processing**\nThe consolidated transcriptome expression matrix and clinical data of LIHC were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). A total of 23 PMGs were summarized from related reviews [15,20]. The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) database (https://dcc.icgc.org/) was adopted to further validate the prognostic features of the model.\n**Construction of palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters and bioinformatics analysis**\nBased on the expression of the 23 PMGs, we utilized the Con-sensuClusterPlus package to identify disparate palmitoylation modification patterns and classified patients for further analysis. We used Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis to explore the survival differences between palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters. Then, we screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among palmitoylation metabolismrelated clusters according to |logFC|\u22651 and adj P value < 0.01. Depending on the DEG expression, we evaluated the enrichment of biological pathways between different clusters by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). In addition, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was adopted to evaluate the enrichment of cancer-related pathways between different palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters with the \"h.all.v2023.1.Hs.symbols\" from MSigDB.\n**Analysis of immune infiltration and function**\nSingle-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was conducted to calculate the enrichment scores of various immune cells and immune functions by the \"GSVA\" package and immune-related gene set.\n**Construction of the palmitoylation metabolism-related signature**\nWe used univariate Cox regression analysis, according to the standard of P value < 0.05, to screen candidate PMGs related to prognosis. Then, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis was conducted to construct the PMS. The algorithm was as follows: PMS = Coef 1 * Gene 2 expression + Coef 2 * Gene 2 expression + \u2026 \u2026Coef X * Gene X expression, with Coef referring to the coefficient calculated by LASSO and gene expression referring to the expression of PMGs. All patients were classified into low-and high PMS groups based on the median value of PMS. In addition, KM analysis, area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and univariate and multivariable logistic regression were adopted to assess the prognostic accuracy of PMS. Tracking tumor immunophenotype (TIP, http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/TIP/) immune activity scores for LIHC samples were collected.\n**Cell culture and gene silencing**\nDulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used to cultivate the HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cell lines, which were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China). At a density of 4 \u00d7 10 5 /mL, HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cells were injected into 6-well plates for 24 h. Synthesized small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The effectiveness of the silencing was evaluated via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Table S1 contains all of the ZDHHC20 siRNA sequences.\n**In vitro detection of gene silencing efficiency**\nUsing TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), total RNA was isolated from the HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cell lines. Then, using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kits (Vazyme, China), extracted RNA was converted into cDNA. Finally, SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Vazyme, China) was used to process the qRT-PCR. Table S2 displays the ZDHHC20 primers.\n**In vitro detection of LIHC proliferation and migration**\nAfter incubation for 24, 48, and 72 h, 10 \u03bcL of Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent was added to 96-well plates containing HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cells from various groups. The cells were then cultivated for 1-4 h in the dark. With the use of an automated microplate reader (Synergy4; BioTek, USA), the absorbance at 450 nm was calculated. Additionally, HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cells were seeded into a 6-well plate and scratched with a 1 mL pipette tip after cell confluence reached 90 %. The diameter of the wounds was assessed after 24 h of treatment with 1 \u03bcg/mL mitomycin C in serum-free media using a microscope (ICX41, SDPTOP, China) at a magnification of 40. ImageJ software was used to measure the wound widths and wound closure rates after photographs of the wounds were taken at 0 and 24 h after scratching. Using a Transwell chamber (Corning, USA) with a 6.5-mm diameter, the transwell migration experiment was also used to test the ability of cells to migrate. In the Transwell chamber, 5 \u00d7 10 5 HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cells were plated in the top chamber, and 700 \u03bcL of DMEM containing 10 % FBS was introduced to the lower chamber. The membranes of the chamber were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min after 24 h of incubation at 37 \u2022 C. The migrating cells were then stained with 0.1 % crystal violet for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C, and the number of cells was counted using an inverted biological microscope (ICX41, SDPTOP, China) at a magnification of 200. In each group, five locations were chosen at random. Three separate independent runs of each experiment were conducted.\n**In vitro detection of LIHC apoptosis**\nDifferent groups of transfected HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Then, using ethylene diamine-tetra acetic acid (EDTA)-free trypsinization, approximately 1 \u00d7 105 cells, including suspended cells, were extracted. They were then rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell apoptosis was identified using a CytoFLEX-3 flow cytometer (BD, USA) in accordance with the directions of the Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis kit (MultiSciences, China). FlowJo software was used to analyze the collected data. Each group was given three replicates, and each experiment was run three times independently.\n**Statistical analysis**\nAll analyses were performed using R 4.2.2. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance unless otherwise noted. KM curves and log-rank tests were utilized to analyze the correlation between PMGs and overall survival (OS) in LIHC patients.\n\n**Results**\n**Establishment and bioinformatic analysis of palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters**\nThe flowchart of the study is shown in Fig. S1. Based on the expression of the 23 PMGs, we utilized the ConsensuClusterPlus package to establish 3 disparate palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters (Fig. 1A). A heatmap showed the distribution of gene expression profiles and clinicopathological variables among different clusters (Fig. 1B). The KM curve showed that the prognosis of Cluster B was the worst (Fig. 1C). A Venn diagram showed that a total of 838 common DEGs between clusters were screened (Fig. 1D). As a further validation, the GO results suggested that the DEGs were mainly localized to histone modification, mRNA metabolism, and transcriptional coregulator activity (Fig. 1E). Simultaneously, KEGG analysis suggested that DEGs were focused on hepatocellular carcinoma, the cell cycle, the mTOR signaling pathway and the mRNA surveillance pathway (Fig. 1F). GSVA analysis revealed that Cluster B was markedly localized to cancer-promoting pathways, including PI3K AKT MTOR signaling and TNFA signaling, via NFKB (Fig. 1G). Cluster A was localized to multiple metabolism pathways (Fig. 1H).\n**Identification of immune characteristics of palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters**\nTo further explore the causes of survival differences among clusters, we analyzed the characteristics of infiltration. The heatmap shows the distribution of tumor microenvironment scores and immune cells in the clusters (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B indicates that Cluster C had the lowest immune function score. In addition, the estimate algorithm was utilized to evaluate tumor microenvironment scores. The stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATEScore were all significantly overexpressed in Cluster A and Cluster B (Fig. 2C). By analyzing the differential expression of immune infiltrating cells in different clusters, the results indicated that the expression of immune infiltrating cells was the highest in Cluster B and the lowest in Cluster C (Fig. 2D). In addition, the expression of most immunosuppressive checkpoints was highest in Cluster B and lowest in Cluster A (Fig. 2E).\n**Establishment of a palmitoylation metabolism-related signature**\nFirst, we found that these PMGs are significantly overexpressed in LIHC and are significantly associated with poor prognosis (Fig. S2). Then, to construct the PMS, univariate Cox regression analysis was adopted to screen out prognosis-related PMGs. According to the P < 0.05 standard, 8 prognosis-related PMGs were screened (Fig. 3A). Then, the 8 prognosis-related PMGs were analyzed by Lasso regression. Finally, 4 PMGs were selected to establish the PMS (Fig. 3B andC). A heatmap showed the distribution of the 4 modeled genes in the PMS groups (Fig. 3D). The KM curve and distribution of survival status revealed that patients in the high PMS group had a worse prognosis (Fig. 3E-G). The ROC curves for PMS at 1, 2, and 3 years in the TCGA dataset were 0.731, 0.662, and 0.644, respectively (Fig. 3H). Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses showed that PMS had good accuracy in predicting the prognosis of LIHC patients (Fig. 3I andJ). The ICGC dataset was adopted as an external validation dataset to validate the accuracy of the PMS. The KM curve indicated that patients in the high PMS group had a worse prognosis in the ICGC dataset (Fig. 3K). The AUCs of the 1-, 2-, and 3year OS of PMS in the ICGC dataset were 0.750, 0.669, and 0.679, respectively (Fig. 3H).\n**Identification of the mutation and immune characteristics of the palmitoylation metabolism-related signature**\nThen, we further evaluated the correlation between PMS and tumor mutation burden (TMB). The mutation rate was 155/175 (88.57 %) in the high PMS group and 148/177 (83.62 %) in the low PMS group (Fig. 4A andB). Meanwhile, the expression of TMB was higher in the high PMS group, which was the same as expected (Fig. 4C). Therefore, patients with high TMB may have a worse prognosis (Fig. 4D). Next, we evaluated the prognostic features of combined PMS and TMB in LIHC patients. The KM survival curve revealed that H-TMB + H-PMS had the worst prognosis, and L-TMB + L-PMS had the best prognosis (Fig. 4E). A heatmap showed immune cell expression in the PMS group under various algorithms (Fig. 5A). Fig. 5B shows the correlation between immune cells and PMS under various algorithms. Immunosuppressive cells (macrophages, MDSCs, regulatory T cells) were significantly overexpressed in the high PMS group (Fig. 5C-E). To further assess the relevance of PMS to immune typing, we then analyzed the differential expression of PMS in previously reported pancancer immune subtypes. The expression of PMS was higher in C1 and C2 and lowest in C3 (Fig. 5F). Fig. 5G reveals that C1 and C2 accounted for more in the high PMS group, while C3 and C4 accounted for more in the low PMS group.\n**Identification of clinicopathologic characteristics and drug sensitivity of the palmitoylation metabolism-related signature**\nTo assess the prognostic features of PMS, we further analyzed the association of PMS with clinicopathologic variables. First, we analyzed the differential expression of PMS in different clinicopathologic variables. We found that PMS differed significantly in different clinicopathologic variables (histological grade, pathological stage and T stage) and was significantly overexpressed in advanced clinicopathological variables (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, we found that there were significant differences in the proportions of different clinicopathological variables between the PMS groups and that there were more advanced clinicopathological variables in the high PMS group (Fig. 6B). The KM curves indicated that among different clinicopathological variables, patients in the high PMS group had a poor prognosis (Fig. 6C). The above results further confirmed that PMS was significantly negatively correlated with LIHC patient prognosis. To further guide the development of clinical treatment strategies, we screened 15 major chemotherapeutic agents from the pRRophetic package to determine whether PMS was associated with LIHC resistance. The IC50 of Epothilone. B, Etoposide, gemcitabine, bortezomib and doxorubicin were higher in the low PMS group, suggesting that these 5 drugs may be more suitable for patients with higher PMS (Fig. S3).\n**Identification of the clinicopathologic and immune characteristics of palmitoylation metabolism-related genes**\nTo further analyze the key events leading to tumorigenesis and progression, we analyzed the correlation between 4 modeled genes and clinicopathological variables. The outcomes showed that ZDHHC20 was differentially expressed in different clinicopathologic variables (Fig. S4). ZDHHC20 was highly correlated with the clinicopathological stage of LIHC patients and played a tumor-promoting role in LIHC. Therefore, the immune characteristics of ZDHHC20 were further investigated. Fig. 7A indicates that immunosuppressive cells (MDSCs, regulatory T cells and macrophages) were overexpressed in the high ZDHHC20 group. Similarly, tumor microenvironment scores (immunescore, stromal score and estimated score) were obviously overexpressed in the high ZDHHC20 group (Fig. 7B). Moreover, we further analyzed the correlations between ZDHHC20 and immunosuppressive checkpoints. The results indicated that immunosuppressive checkpoints were highly expressed in the high ZDHHC20 group (Fig. 7C).\n**ZDHHC20 suppresses LIHC cell apoptosis while promoting their proliferation and migration**\nWe looked at how the ZDHHC20 gene affected LIHC proliferation, migration, and apoptosis to learn more about the role of ZDHHC20 in LIHC cells. In HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cells, si-ZDHHC20-1 effectively reduced ZDHHC20 expression (Fig. 8A andB). When compared to the si-NC group, CCK-8 analysis revealed that ZDHHC20 knockdown affected the capacity of both HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cells to proliferate (Fig. 8C andD). Additionally, ZDHHC20 depletion greatly inhibited the migration of HepG-2 and SMCC-7721 cells, as demonstrated by transwell migration and wound healing assays (Fig. 8E-H). According to the flow cytometry findings, ZDHHC20 dramatically reduced LIHC apoptosis (Fig. 8I). In Fig. S5, a nomogram combined with clinical data revealed the correlation between the expression of the ZDHHC20 gene and LIHC clinical features. Further validation of ZDHHC20's potential role in LIHC was supported by GSEA analysis and immunohistochemical images from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database.\n\n**Discussion**\nLIHC patients have a wide range of treatment options, including liver transplantation and surgical resection [21,22]. However, the prognosis of LIHC patients is still not satisfactory [23]. With the in-depth study of LIHC, traditional histopathological features (tumor size, stage, grade) may not be able to meet the needs of diagnosis and prognosis [24]. Palmitoylation acts on a variety of proteins and is widely involved in various metabolic and cancer-promoting pathways [25]. Therefore, we explored the role of palmitoylation metabolism in LIHC and provided a prognostic prediction method to rationally guide clinical decision-making.\nIn this paper, based on the expression profiles of 23 PMGs, we divided LIHC patients into 3 palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters with different prognostic and immune features. By analyzing the differences in immune infiltration among the 3 palmitoylation metabolismrelated clusters, we found that the three clusters had significantly different characteristics of immune infiltration. We speculated that a large number of immune cell infiltration and immune-related pathways were enriched in Cluster A, which was considered to be an immuneinflammatory type; a large number of innate immune cell infiltration and cancer-promoting activation-related pathways were enriched in Cluster B, and Cluster B was considered an immune excluded type; and there was a lack of immune cell infiltration in Cluster C, which was considered an immune desert type. However, Cluster B was significantly enriched in innate immune cells but had a poorer prognosis. It has been shown that immune-excluded tumors are infiltrated by immune cells, but these immune cells are only present in the stroma surrounding the tumor cells. Therefore, activation of the stroma in the tumor microenvironment was considered to be T-cell suppression [26]. Next, a palmitoylation metabolism-related prognostic model was constructed by using unicox and Lasso analysis, and the stability of the palmitoylation metabolism-related prognostic model was validated through univariate and multivariate independent prognostic analysis and the ICGC dataset. In the tumor microenvironment, invasive immune cells play key roles in tumor proliferation, metastasis, and anticancer immune regulation and are extremely important therapeutic targets [27][28][29]. The tumor microenvironment score and immunosuppressive cell infiltration were higher in the high PMS group. Therefore, the palmitoylation metabolism-related prognostic model may be a key marker to evaluate patient prognosis and immune response and help guide the formulation of individualized treatment plans for LIHC patients.\nPalmitoylation is an important and reversible posttranslational modification that is widely involved in the proliferation and metastasis of various tumors. Liu et al. revealed that immune dysregulation or activation of cancer-promoting pathways caused by abnormal expression of ZDHHC family genes may be one of the reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma [30]. ZDHHC5 was overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma and promoted tumorigenesis and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma by mediating S-palmitoylation of INCENP [31]. ZDHHC9 plays a tumor-promoting role in colon adenocarcinoma and may be a potential therapeutic target [32]. ZDHHC20 may drive cell growth and transformation through palmitoylation of N-terminal myristoylated substrate proteins [33]. ZDHHC20 may participate in the regulation of tumor progression by regulating the palmitoylation of the EGFR pathway [34,35]. In this paper, we found that ZDHHC20 was a key regulator of palmitoylation metabolism and played an oncogenic role in LIHC. In addition, ZDHHC20 was significantly associated with immunosuppressive cells and immune checkpoints and involved in the construction of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to promote tumor proliferation and metastasis.\nInevitably, our study had limitations. First, the current analysis only utilized statistical data from existing retrospective data, and prospective studies are necessary to further verify the accuracy of the palmitoylation metabolism-related prognostic model. Second, considering that there are no immune cells in the cell culture system, the mechanisms by which the ZDHHC20 gene and immune cells affect LIHC proliferation, migration, and apoptosis need more experiments to explore in the future. Finally, there should be further experimental studies on the protein expression level of ZDHHC20 and its mechanism of action in the progression of LIHC, especially in vivo detections.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBriefly, we divided patients into 3 palmitoylation metabolism-related clusters with distinct prognostic and immune characteristics. Moreover, a palmitoylation metabolism-related prognostic model was constructed in LIHC patients, which may be a marker to predict the prognosis and immune response of LIHC patients.' Meanwhile, ZDHHC20 may contribute to the construction of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which may become a target for immunotherapy to further guide clinical treatment decisions.  \n\n\nBackground: Protein S-palmitoylation is a reversible posttranslational modification widely involved in tumor progression. Nevertheless, the function of palmitoylation metabolism in prognosis and tumor microenvironment characteristics in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) patients is not fully understood.
