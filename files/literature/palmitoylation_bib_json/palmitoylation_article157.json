    "fullText": "**INTRODUCTION**\nProgrammed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an essential immune checkpoint molecule overexpressed on malignant cells. 1 It restrains antitumor T cell immunity via binding to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expressed on T cells. 2 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy using inhibitors to disrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has revolutionized the landscape and outcome of cancer treatment. [3][4][5][6][7] This therapy is often used in clinical practice in combination with chemotherapy that induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and initiate T cell immunity. 8,9 Although this chemo-immunotherapy has shown impressive clinical outcomes in certain cancer types, the overall respond rate of patients is still far from satisfactory. 10,11 Recent studies have identified that circulating regeneration of PD-L1 in cancer cells is one of the key factors. 12 PD-L1 on cancer cells may be internalized into cells and recycle back to the cell membrane via endosomal trafficking. 13 Since most ICB inhibitors such as antibodies and small molecular drugs only block PD-1/PD-L1 interaction at the cell surface, the intracellular recycling of PD-L1 therefore leads to the resistance of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. 14 Hence, it shows that interrupting the redistribution of PD-L1 to downregulate PD-L1 expression has the potential to promote the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy.\nPalmitoylation of PD-L1 is a post-translational modification process that plays a vital role in recycle regulation of PD-L1. 15 PD-L1 can be palmitoylated by palmitoyltransferase DHHC3 before endosomal trafficking. 13 The palmitoylation inhibits ubiquitination of PD-L1 and prevents its lysosomal degradation, thereby leading to the translocation of PD-L1 to the cell membrane. A recent study discovered that inhibition of PD-L1 palmitoylation by small molecular 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) or competitive PD-L1-derived peptide not only downregulated PD-L1 on the cell membrane, but also depleted its storage in recycling endosomes. 13 Compared to 2-BP, the competitive peptides are more specific in targeting and more biocompatible. 16 However, the drawbacks of peptides, such as instability, susceptibility to degradation, and short half-life, limit their therapeutic application at the in vivo level. 17 To the best of our knowledge, peptide-based strategies to enhance chemoimmunotherapy through inhibition of PD-L1 palmitoylation have rarely been reported.\nTo avoid peptide degradation, liposomes, polymers, dendrimers and inorganic nanoparticles have been widely used for the delivery of therapeutic peptides. [18][19][20][21] Alternatively, modification of peptides themselves into nanostructures via conjugating hydrophobic components improves peptide stability and cytosolic internalization. [22][23][24] Notably, the fluoroalkylation of peptides has a high tendency for selfassembly into nanostructures via a fluorous effect due to low surface energy, endowing the fluorinated materials with good serum resistance and efficient endocytosis capability. 25,26 In addition, the delivered cargo peptides could maintain their bioactivity after fluoroalkylation. Therefore, fluoroalkylation modification of PDL1-competitive peptides is expected to address instability during cellular delivery and enhance the efficacy of chemo-immunotherapy.\nHerein, we developed a peptide-based nanoinhibitor of PD-L1 palmitoylation for enhanced chemo-immunotherapy. The nanoinhibitor (denoted as FRS) was self-assembled by a fluoroalkyl-peptide conjugate (Schemes 1A and 1B), in which a competitive peptide inhibitor (the sequence: RMMDVKKCGIQDTNS, termed \"RS\") is decorated with a thiol-carrying fluorous tag via the formation of disulfide linkage. The fluoroalkylation not only promoted the selfassembly and cellular delivery of FRS, but also facilitated FRS to achieve lysosomal escape within cancer cells. The presence of the glutathione (GSH)-responsive disulfide bond allowed disassembly of the FRS nanostructure after lysosomal escape, \n\n**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**\nSynthesis and Characterization of PD-L1 Nanoinhibitor. FRS peptide was synthesized in the following steps. First, fluorous tag with reduction-sensitive disulfide bond was prepared (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information) via a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction. 25 Next, PD-L1 competitive inhibitory peptide RS was synthesized by a standard solidphase peptide synthesis (SPPS) method using Fmoc protected amino acids 27,28 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). RS was then conjugated with a fluorous tag peptide via a GSHresponsive disulfide bond to form FRS (Figure 1A). The purity of FRS was confirmed by analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (Figures 1B and1C). The FRS peptide was assembled into nanoparticles in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), due to the well-known fluorophilic effect 25,29 and the extremely low surface energy of fluoroalkyl chains. 30 The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows the spherical morphology of FRS with a particle size of \u223c100 nm, which is consistent with the \"Tyndall effect\" observed in  the particle suspension (Figure 1D). The hydrodynamic diameter was \u223c121.74 nm with a surface charge of 11.84 \u00b1 0.29 mV in neutral PBS (see Figure 1E, as well as Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The release of RS from FRS nanoparticles could be triggered by intracellular GSH that have been reported to be present in high concentration (\u223c1-10 mM) in tumor cells. 31,32 We incubated the FRS in GSH solution with two concentrations (1 mM and 10 mM) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to investigate the sensitivity of FRS to GSH (Figure 1F). The characteristic peak of FRS almost disappeared at 41 min while the typical peak of RS appeared at 19 min in HPLC spectra upon GSH treatment at concentrations of both 1 and 10 mM. Meanwhile, MS spectra further confirmed the efficient GSH-responsive release of RS peptide (Figure S4). As shown in Figure 1G, the nanoparticles have been disassembled upon GSH treatment, further supporting the successful release of the RS peptide. These results demonstrate that FRS nanoparticles has GSH-responsive release properties.\nThe stability is crucial for application of peptide nanomaterials. 33 The FRS nanoparticles maintained their sizes without accumulation in PBS for 7 days, indicating the long-term dispersibility of the FRS (Figure 1H). Besides, FRS nanoparticles were also well-dispersed for 48 h under physiological conditions such as a cell culture medium, which was beneficial for improving the efficiency of cell delivery (Figure 1I). Importantly, the self-assembly of fluorous-tagged peptides into nanoparticles may protect the peptides against degradation in serum. We determined the degradation of FRS nanoparticles after incubation in serum at 37 \u00b0C for different times. Free RS peptides were tested as controls. As shown in Figure 1J, free RS was completely degraded after 0.5 h of incubation with the serum. However, when the fluorous tag was conjugated, the FRS showed better resistance to serum. Compared to free RS, \u223c76% of FRS remained in the serum at 0.5 h and \u223c37% of FRS still retained its initial structure after 12 h. The difference in degradation between the FRS and RS was further confirmed by HPLC analysis (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). The results exhibit the superior biostability of FRS nanoparticles, demonstrating the protective effect of fluoroalkylated self-assembly on functional peptides.\nCytotoxicity and Cellular Delivery Evaluation. CT26 is a murine colorectal carcinoma cell line that has been reported to overexpress PD-L1. 34 Thus, the performances of FRS nanoparticles and FRS/DOX formulation were investigated in the CT26 cell model. We first determined the cytotoxicity of FRS and FRS/DOX in CT26 cells via the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Figure S6A in the Supporting Information shows the negligible toxicity of both RS peptides and FRS nanoparticles, indicating the excellent biocompatibility of fluoroalkyl-peptides. The cell viability of FRS/DOX and free DOX decreased in the same trend, with increasing concentration of DOX (Figure S6B in the Supporting Information), suggesting that most of the cytotoxicity in the FRS/DOX group originated only from DOX.\nNext, we evaluated the cellular delivery and endosomal escape performance of the FRS nanoparticles. To better visualize the intracellular location of peptides, 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), which is a green fluorescent probe, was used to label the RS and FRS peptides for in vitro confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry analysis. Figures S7 andS8 in the Supporting Information confirmed the success of FAM-labeling on RS and FRS peptides (termed as FAM-RS and FAM-FRS, respectively). The FAM-FRS peptides can also be assembled into nanoparticles (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). After incubation with CT26 cells, FRS nanoparticles exhibited a time-dependent increase of FAM fluorescence, which was much stronger than that of RS at selective time points, demonstrating that fluoroalkylation significantly promoted the cellular delivery of peptides (Figures 2A and2B). The endosomal escape capability of FRS nanoparticles was detected via fluorescent colocalization analysis of peptides (FAM, green) and lysosomes (Lysotracker, red) in confocal images (Figure 2A). Over time, more green signals were presented in different positions to the red signal in the FRS group, while there was an increasing intensity of yellow signal (colocalization) in the RS group. It demonstrated that fluoroalkylation assisted the peptide to achieve endosomal escape within the cells. These results collectively suggested that fluoroalkylation significantly facilitated the cytosolic delivery of peptides. We also evaluated the delivery efficiency of FRS/ DOX mixtures, which showed a trend similar trend with FRS. FRS/DOX was efficiently internalized within CT26 cells in an incubation-time-dependent manner.\nFRS/DOX-Mediated PD-L1 Inhibition and Immunogenic Cell Death In Vitro. To study the inhibitory effect of FRS on PD-L1, we detected PD-L1 expression in the CT26 cell model after treatment of FRS with different concentrations. Figure 2D shows that FRS significantly inhibited the expression of PD-L1 in a dose-dependent manner. We also compared the inhibitory effects between different formulations quantitatively and qualitatively. As evidenced in Figures 2E and2F, both FRS/DOX and FRS exhibited stronger inhibition on total PD-L1 expression than RS and DOX, with effects comparable to anti-PD-L1 antibodies. CLSM images demonstrated that FRS/DOX and FRS could also downregulate the surface expression of PD-L1 on CT26 cells (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). FRS and FRS/DOX downregulated PD-L1 to a higher degree than the other control groups in a time-dependent manner (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). After 24 h of treatment, cells were further incubated in a cell culture medium for another 24 h. PD-L1 was not recirculated in the FRS and FRS/DOX groups at 48 h, while the recovery of surface PD-L1 was increased by anti-PD-L1 treatment (see Figure S11). Previous studies have reported that PD-L1 can be rapidly recycled and recovered after anti-PD-L1 binding to surface PD-L1. 35 Our designed FRS, as a competitive inhibitor of PD-L1 palmitoylation, could eliminate PD-L1 within the cell by dragging it to lysosomal degradation (Figure 2G). As expected, the click-iT assay validated the FRSinduced inhibition of PD-L1 palmitoylation (Figure 2H). We demonstrated lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1)-marked lysosome colocalization with intracellular PD-L1 after FRS and FRS/DOX treatment, while only partial and limited colocalization was found by treatment of anti-PD-L1(Figure 2I), which suggested that inhibiting palmitoylation effectively promoted PD-L1 degradation through the lysosomal pathway. The above results demonstrate that our FRS nanoparticles disrupted PD-L1 cycling via inhibition of PD-L1 palmitoylation, which is distinct from reported peptidebased nanoparticles that inhibit PD-L1 expression via multivalent binding of anti-PD-L1 peptides on nanoparticles with PD-L1 on tumor cells. [35][36][37] Previous studies have intensively demonstrated that chemotherapeutic agent DOX is able to induce ICD of tumor cells to alert the immune system. 38 Here, we verified the capability of FRS/DOX to induce ICD via measuring the emergence of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) 39 such as exposed calreticulin (CRT) and released high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in vitro. Undoubtedly, both FRS/DOX and free DOX significantly upregulated the expression of CRT and HMGB1 while there was no obvious difference among the FRS, RS, and PBS groups (Figures 3A-D). Note that FRS/ DOX induced a higher expression of CRT and HMGB1 than  4B-D, as well as Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). In addition, FRS treatment also showed considerable antitumor efficacy, which is much more potent than RS treatment. The weaker antitumor efficacy of free RS peptides is due to their poor proteolytic stability and low delivery efficiency in vivo. The potent suppression of FRS/DOX resulted from the synergistic effect of FRS-induced PD-L1 downregulation and DOXtriggered ICD. We observed the FRS/DOX group with the lowest level of PD-L1 expression and the highest level of DAMPs (i.e., CRT and HMGB1) in tumor sections (Figure 4E). The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay further verified the killing effect of FRS/DOX in the tumor (Figure 4F). Besides, the FRS/DOX group achieved the highest survival rate (100% over 30 days), whereas the median survival in PBS, RS, FRS, DOX, and anti-PD-L1 antibody groups were only 18, 20, 24, 20, and 20 days, respectively (Figure S14A). Safety of different formulations were also conducted. Both body measurements and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed that no severe health problems were caused by treatments (see Figures S14B andS14C in the Supporting Information). Taken together, these observations manifested the great potential of FRS/DOX as a potent therapeutic agent in chemo-immunotherapy.\nAs both immune checkpoint blockade and immunogenic cell death have been reported to promote cytotoxic T cell activation in tumor, 40,41 we then investigated the regulatory effects of FRS/DOX on T cell infiltration and activation in tumors 4 days after all treatments. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that FRS/DOX dramatically elevated infiltration of both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells in tumors, with the highest population compared to other groups (Figures 5A, 5B, and5D). More importantly, FRS/DOX induced the strongest activation of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells, as evidenced by the highest level of CD69 + and IFN-\u03b3 + in the CD8 + population (Figures 5C and5E). It suggests that the strong T cell immunity significantly contributed to the antitumor effect of FRS/DOX, in addition to the direct kill effect of DOX. FRS/ DOX formulation was found to significantly decrease the population of CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + cells (Figure S15 in the Supporting Information), which is key regulatory T cells in tumors. 42 Notably, FRS nanoparticles could also increase the T cell infiltration due to its inhibitory regulation on PD-L1. Proteomics analysis of mouse plasma further supported the capability of FRS in immune activation. FRS treatment induced a significant change in the expression of 74 proteins, compared to PBS treatment. Among them, 43 proteins were upregulated and 31 proteins were downregulated (Figure S16A in the Supporting Information). Differential express proteins such as Hspd1, 43 Masp1, 44 Hspa5, 45 and Hspa8 46 were found to associate with immune pathways (Figure S16B in the Supporting Information). The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis both showed that FRS treatment resulted in changes in immune-related pathways, such as complement and coagulation cascades, positive regulation of the immune effector process, and activation of the immune response (Figures S16C and S16D in the Supporting Information). Due to the critical role of FRS in immune activation, the synergy treatment of FRS and DOX achieved potent T cell activation and cellular immunity. As expected, significant increase in the population of CD8 + T cells and the level of antitumor cytokines (i.e., TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) in blood samples were observed in FRS/DOX group (Figures 5F-H). These outcomes revealed the superior antitumor efficacy of FRS/DOX by inducing a synergistic effect of ICD and PD-L1 downregulation.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\nIn summary, we have developed a nanoinhibitor (FRS) selfassembled by fluoroalkyl PD-L1-targeting competitive peptides that endogenously downregulate PD-L1 expression in tumor. It is demonstrated that FRS nanoparticles have great potential as an immune checkpoint inhibitor with great efficiency in PD-L1 inhibition at both in vitro and in vivo levels. Moreover, the combination of FRS and DOX was able to induce strong T cell immunity and potent antitumor efficacy in mouse tumor models via significant synergy of immune checkpoint blockade and immunogenic cell death. This work presents a promising strategy to overcome the obstacles of chemo-immunotherapy resulting from the recycling generation of PD-L1 expression in tumor.\n\n**METHODS**\n**Synthesis of Fluorous-Tagged PD-L1 Competitive Inhibitory Peptide (FRS).**\nCompound RS (5 mg, 0.003 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol. Fluorous tag (4.4 mg, 0.009 mmol) in 1 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) was slowly added to the RS solution under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture stirred for 4 h at room temperature for the reaction. Then, a portion of the reaction solvents was removed by a rotary evaporator. The fluorous-tagged FRS peptide was purified by semipreparative HPLC. The purity of FRS was confirmed by HPLC and further characterized by MALDI-TOF MS. FRS peptides were dissolved in dry dimethyl sulfoxide and then slowly added to PBS (pH 7.4) for self-assembly. The nanoparticles were redispersed in PBS by removing the solvent of assembled nanoparticles through a 3000-Da molecular weight cutoff membrane. For the synthesis of FAM-FRS, the product was assembled by using the same method.\nHuman Serum Stability Assay. Human serum was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 15 min, and then the supernatant was collected to prewarm to 37 \u00b0C. 100 \u03bcM of RS peptides and FRS nanoparticles were respectively diluted in PBS. The sample solutions (300 \u03bcL) were mixed with 300 \u03bcL of serum and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. At various time points (t = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h), 50 \u03bcL aliquots were withdrawn, quenched with 2% TFA/50% ACN in water (100 \u03bcL), and cooled at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. Afterward, the mixture was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 5 min and the final supernatant was immediately analyzed by HPLC. (The mobile phase of HPLC was ACN/H 2 O (90/10 v/v) containing 0.05% TFA. Samples were run under a linear gradient from 20% (v/v) ACN at 10 min to 65% (v/v) ACN at 50 min and then to 80% ACN at 60 min.) The remaining products (%) were quantitively determined by integrating the area underneath the corresponding peak (monitored at 214 nm) and compared with that of the control.\nCytotoxicity Assay. The cytotoxicity of RS, FRS, DOX, and FRS/ DOX was assessed in CT26 cells by an MTT assay. In general, 1 \u00d7 10 4 CT26 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h of stabilization, cells were then treated with a medium containing different concentrations of materials for 24 h. Then, the cells were further incubated with MTT solution for 4 h. The cell viability was measured after adding 200 \u03bcL of DMSO by a microplate reader with 490 nm of wavelength.\nApoptosis Assay. Apoptosis of CT26 cells was examined using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Beyotime). Briefly, the cells were seeded in the 12-well plates at the density of 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well. After 24 h, the cells were incubated with PBS, RS, FRS, DOX, FRS/DOX, and Anti-PD-L1 (peptides: 40 \u03bcM; DOX: 5 \u03bcM) for 24 h. The subsequent procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol and measured using flow cytometry (BD FACS Calibur, BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).\nCellular Uptake. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometry were used to reveal the intracellular behavior of FRS and FRS/DOX by CT26 cells. 2 \u00d7 10 5 CT26 cells were seeded in glass-bottom confocal dishes. After 24 h of stabilization, cells were incubated with PBS, FAM-RS, FAM-FRS, DOX, or FAM-FRS/DOX (peptide concentration, 10 \u03bcM; DOX concentration, 5 \u03bcM) at 37 \u00b0C for 1, 2, and 4 h. Then, the cells were washed with PBS, stained with LysoTracker Deep Red (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min, and stained with Hoechst 33342 for 5 min. Fluorescence imaging was performed using CLSM (Leica TCS SP8, Germany). For flow cytometry, CT26 cells were seeded in 12-well plates (1.5 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well) for 12 h. Thereafter, the cells were treated with FAM-RS, FAM-FRS or FAM-FRS/DOX (peptide concentration, 10 \u03bcM; DOX concentration, 5 \u03bcM) for 1, 2, and 4 h. The cells were digested with trypsin, washed three times with PBS, and then resuspended in PBS. The cytosolic delivery efficiency was quantitatively analyzed by flow cytometry.\nPD-L1 Expression Inhibition. PD-L1 expression in CT26 cells after treatment was analyzed via CLSM and Western blot. For CLSM analysis, CT26 cells were treated with PBS, RS, FRS, DOX, FRS/ DOX, or Anti-PD-L1 antibodies (peptides, 40 \u03bcM; DOX, 5 \u03bcM) for 12 and 24 h. After 24 h, the cells were washed and incubated with fresh cell culture medium for another 24 h. Then, the cells were washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde (0.4%). After blocking the cells with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS solution, rabbit anti-PD-L1 antibody (Abcam) was added overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Next, the cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature, whereas the nuclei were stained with Hoechst33258 before CLSM observation. For Western blot assay, 3 \u00d7 10 5 of CT26 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Twenty four hours later, the cells were incubated with PBS, RS, FRS, DOX, FRS/DOX, or Anti-PD-L1 antibodies (peptides, 40 \u03bcM; DOX, 5 \u03bcM) for 24 h. Then, cells were lysed by the addition of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. After centrifuging the lysates at 12 000 rpm for 15 min to remove cell debris, the concentration of proteins in lysates were determined via BCA protein quantification kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). Proteins were separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were blocked by an Intercept (PBS) Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) for 1 h. Then, monoclonal rabbit anti-PD-L1 antibody (Abcam), monoclonal mouse anti-GAPDH antibody (Abcam), IRDye 680RD secondary antibody, and IRDye 800CW secondary antibody (LI-COR) were used for the Western blotting assay. Finally, immunoreactive bands were observed via an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR).\nPalmitoylation Inhibition of PD-L1. After incubation of PBS, RS, and FRS, cells were washed and further treated with 100 \u03bcM Click-iT palmitic acid-azide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 \u00b0C for 8 h. Then, the medium was removed, and the cells were collected. The cells were added 200 \u03bcL of lysis buffer (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 15-30 min on ice, and then sonicated the lysate with a probe sonicator in order to solubilize the proteins and disperse the DNA. Vortex the lysate for 5 min and centrifuge the cell lysate at 15 000g at 4 \u00b0C for 15 min. Then, we transferred the supernatant to a clean tube and determined the protein concentration using a BSA Protein Quantitation Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). Next, the protein samples were reacted with biotin-alkyne using the Click-iT Protein Reaction Buffer Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the protocols from the instruction sheet. The biotin alkyne-azideplamitic protein complex was then pulled down by streptavidin and washed for PD-L1 immunoblotting detection.\nLysosomal PD-L1 Degradation. CT26 cells were treated with PBS, RS, FRS, FRS/DOX, or Anti-PD-L1 antibodies (peptides, 40 \u03bcM; DOX, 5 \u03bcM) for 12 h. Then, cells were washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde (0.4%). Next, the cells were blocked with 5% goat serum/PBS for 1 h. The rabbit anti-PD-L1 antibody (Abcam) was added overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The cells were stained Alexa Fluor 488conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature. After that, cells were washed and stained with Alexa Fluor 647 Anti-LAMP1 antiboby (Abcam). The Hoechst33258 was used to stain nuclei before CLSM observation.\nIn Vitro CRT Exposure. CRT exposure induced by FRS/DOX was evaluated by CLSM and flow cytometry. For CLSM analysis, CT26 cells were treated with PBS, RS, FRS, DOX, FRS/DOX or Anti-PD-L1 (peptides, 40 \u03bcM; DOX, 5 \u03bcM) for 24 h. Then, the cells were washed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were blocked with a 1% BSA/PBS solution. The rabbit anti-CRT antibody (Abcam) was then added for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Abcam) for 0.5 h. The Hoechst33258 was used to stain nuclei before CLSM observation. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-CRT antibody (Abcam) for 0.5 h at 4 \u00b0C. Then, the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Abcam) was added in the cells for 0.5 h of staining before being analyzed by flow a cytometer.\nIn Vitro HMGB1 Release. CT26 cells were treated with PBS, RS, FRS, DOX, FRS/DOX, or Anti-PD-L1 (peptides, 40 \u03bcM; DOX, 5 \u03bcM) for 24 h. The supernatants from each well were harvested to measure the released HMGB1, which were analyzed via an HMGB1 assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). The cells were washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%). Then, the cells were washed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-100 for 5 min. The cells were then blocked by PBS solution containing BSA (5%), goat serum (10%), glycine (0.3M), and Tween 20 (0.1%). The cells were further incubated with rabbit anti-HMGB1 antibody (Abcam) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Next, the cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Abcam) for 0.5 h. After being stained with Hoechst33258, the immunofluorescence of HMGB1 was analyzed by CLSM.\nIn Vivo Antitumor Efficacy Evaluation. The antitumor efficacy was evaluated in the CT26 mouse tumor model. The CT26 tumorbearing BALB/C mice were prepared by subcutaneous inoculation of 1 \u00d7 10 6 CT26 cells on the back. When the tumor volumes reached 50-100 mm 3 , the mice were randomly divided into six groups: (i) PBS, (ii) RS (5 \u03bcmol/kg), (iii) FRS (5 \u03bcmol/kg), (iv) DOX (2.5 mg/ kg), (v) FRS/DOX, and (vi) anti-PD-L1 antibodies (2.5 mg/kg). PBS, RS (5 \u03bcmol/kg), FRS (5 \u03bcmol/kg), DOX (2.5 mg/kg), and (v) FRS/DOX were intratumorally injected once every 3 days for 4 doses. Anti-PD-L1 antibodies (2.5 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected once every 3 days for 4 doses as positive control. Then, the tumor volume and body weight of the mice were measured every other day during the therapy. The tumor volumes were calculated as length \u00d7 width 2 \u00d7 0.5. The tumor size for benevolent end point was set as 2000 mm 3 . All dissected tumors were examined by TUNEL staining. In addition, all of the vital organs were gained and used for H&E staining.\nIn Vivo Immune Response Experiments. To examine the immune response of FRS/DOX, tumor tissues and blood samples were collected 4 days after treatment. The isolated single cells from tumor tissues were blocked with Fc-Block (Biolegend) for 10 min to avoid nonspecific antibody binding before flow cytometry analysis. Then, multiparameter staining was processed at 4 \u00b0C in darkness to analyze the following populations in tumor tissues: (i) CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (CD45 + CD4 + and CD45 + CD8 + ); (ii) CD69 + cells in CD8 + T cells (CD8 + CD69 + ); (iii) IFN-\u03b3 + cells (CD8 + IFN-\u03b3 + ); and (iv) Foxp3 + cells (CD45 + CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + ). Besides, the dissected tumor tissues were used to examine PD-L1 expression, CRT exposure, and HMGB1 release. For the analysis of blood samples, the red blood cells were lysed to obtain the leukocytes, which were blocked and stained with multicolor antibodies to assess the population of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CD45 + CD3 + CD8 + ) in the blood. The concentration of cytokines in the blood was also detected by using the IFN-\u03b3 (Multi Sciences) and TNF-\u03b1 (Abcam) ELISA kits.\n**ASSOCIATED CONTENT**\n*** s\u0131 Supporting Information**\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.3c09968.

However, circulating regeneration of PD-L1 within tumor cells greatly limits the efficiency of chemo-immunotherapy and consequent patient response rates. Herein, we report the synthesis of a nanoparticle-based PD-L1 inhibitor (FRS) with a rational design for effective endogenous PD-L1 suppression. The nanoinhibitor is achieved through self-assembly of fluoroalkylated competitive peptides that target PD-L1 palmitoylation. The FRS nanoparticles provide efficient protection and delivery of functional peptides to the cytoplasm of tumors, showing greater inhibition of PD-L1 than nonfluorinated peptidic inhibitors. Moreover, we demonstrate that FRS synergizes with chemotherapeutic doxorubicin (DOX) to boost the antitumor activities via simultaneous reduction of PD-L1 abundance and induction of immunogenic cell death in murine colon tumor models. The nano strategy of PD-L1 regulation present in this study is expected to advance the development of ICB inhibitors and overcome the limitations of conventional ICB-assisted chemoimmunotherapy.\n\n",
