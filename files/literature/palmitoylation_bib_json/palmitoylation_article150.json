    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Protein palmitoylation is involved in learning and memory, and in emotional disorders. Yet, the underlying mechanisms in these processes remain unclear. Herein, we describe that A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) is essential and sufficient for depressive-like behaviours in mice via a palmitoylation-dependent mechanism. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Depressive-like behaviours in mice were induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Palmitoylated proteins in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) were assessed by an acyl-biotin exchange assay. Genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to investigate the role of the DHHC2-mediated AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling pathway in depressive-like behaviours. Electrophysiological recording, western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to define the mechanistic pathway. KEY RESULTS: Chronic stress successfully induced depressive-like behaviours in mice and enhanced AKAP150 palmitoylation in the BLA, and a palmitoylation inhibitor was enough to reverse these changes. Blocking the AKAP150-PKA interaction with the peptide Ht-31 abolished the CRS-induced AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling pathway. DHHC2 expression and palmitoylation levels were both increased after chronic stress. DHHC2 knockdown prevented CRS-induced depressive-like behaviours, as well as attenuating AKAP150 signalling and synaptic transmission in the BLA in CRS-treated mice. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These results delineate that DHHC2 modulates chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviours and synaptic transmission in the BLA via the AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling pathway, and this pathway may be considered as a promising novel therapeutic target for major depressive disorder.\n",

Palmitoylation is essential in the regulation of intracellular protein traffic and function; for example, PSD-95 palmitoylation is required for sorting PSD-95 to dendrites and participates in the postsynaptic clustering of PSD-95 in dendritic spines, thereby regulating the clustering of AMPARs (el-Husseini et al., 2002;Fukata et al., 2006). Furthermore, palmitoylation of the AKAP150 N-terminal polybasic domain targets it to postsynaptic lipid rafts and dendritic recycling endosomes (Matt et al., 2019).

    "fullText": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects approximately over 300 million people globally, equivalent to 4.4% of the world's population (Davis et al., 2021), and is associated with serious social economic burden. The primary drug therapy of MDD is only effective in 30% of MDD patients (Galecki et al., 2022). Limited understanding of the pathophysiology at cellular and molecular levels has been a major setback in developing novel therapeutic interventions. Basolateral amygdala (BLA) serves as a central neural substrate underlying the regulation of emotional behaviours (Benarroch, 2015;Rainnie et al., 2004), and previous reports showed that amygdala is hyperexcited in stressed mice (Franceschi Biagioni et al., 2021;Mitra, 2019); additionally, an increased complexity of dendrites and an ascendance of mature spine density were observed in the BLA (Karst & Joels, 2016;Mitra et al., 2005;Zhang et al., 2019). In contrast, other critical brain regions involved in MDD, such as prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, exhibit reduced synaptic transmission and neuronal morphology atrophy (Belleau et al., 2019;Duman & Aghajanian, 2012;Ota & Duman, 2013). However, the underlying mechanism of chronic stress-induced hyperexcitability in the BLA remains elusive.\nIn recent years, there has been accumulating clinical and preclinical evidence for the involvement of glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology and therapy of MDD. The increase in glutamate levels and dysregulation of genes related to glutamate signalling have been found in patients with MDD (de Sousa et al., 2017;Kantrowitz et al., 2021). Glutamate and its receptors play essential roles in regulating synaptic transmission strength (Sedlak et al., 2019;Tzingounis & Wadiche, 2007). Emerging evidence shows that multiple molecules are involved in the modification of glutamatergic transmission, including calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95), protein kinase A (PKA) and A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP) (Chergui et al., 2005;Fries et al., 2023;Groc & Choquet, 2020;Sanderson & Dell'Acqua, 2011). Among these molecules, AKAP150 in mice (also called AKAP79 in human) emerges as an important regulator of synaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) (Bhattacharyya et al., 2009), which has been reported to be associated with susceptibility to depression (Albani et al., 2014). AKAP150 anchors PKA and Ca 2+ -dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) to regulate the phosphorylation level of GluA1, thereby bidirectionally modifying the synaptic expression of GluA1 (Esteban et al., 2003;Sanderson et al., 2016). Furthermore, previous results revealed that AKAP150 complex in the BLA contributes to depressive-like behaviours induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) (Zhou et al., 2019). However, direct evidence about dynamic regulatory mechanism of AKAP150 complex in chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviours is lacking.\nPalmitoylation is a reversible lipid modification, which consists of the posttranslational addition of saturated 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitic acid to cysteine residue through formation of a labile thioester linkage (Deane, 2018;Matt et al., 2019). Palmitoylation is essential in the regulation of intracellular protein traffic and function; for example, PSD-95 palmitoylation is required for sorting PSD-95 to dendrites and participates in the postsynaptic clustering of PSD-95 in dendritic spines, thereby regulating the clustering of AMPARs (el-Husseini et al., 2002;Fukata et al., 2006). Furthermore, palmitoylation of the AKAP150 N-terminal polybasic domain targets it to postsynaptic lipid rafts and dendritic recycling endosomes (Matt et al., 2019). Importantly, AKAP150 palmitoylation regulates spine enlargement, endosome recycling and AMPAR trafficking pathways associated with LTP (Purkey et al., 2018;Robertson et al., 2009). Here, we asked whether AKAP150 palmitoylation is involved in chronic stress-associated synaptic transmission in the BLA. In addition, DHHC2, a palmitoylating\n\n**What is already known**\n\u2022 The AKAP150 signalling pathway regulates excitatory synaptic transmission.\n\u2022 DHHC2 controls AKAP150 function by palmitoylation.\n**What does this study add**\n\u2022 Chronic stress up-regulates DHHC2 function in the basolateral amygdala.\n\u2022 DHHC2 induces depressive-like behaviour by selectively palmitoylating AKAP150, not PSD-95.\n**What is the clinical significance**\n\u2022 DHHC2-mediated AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling may be a promising strategy for stress-related emotional disorders treatment. enzyme, induces the palmitoylation of PSD-95 and AKAP150 (Fukata et al., 2013;Woolfrey et al., 2015). Interestingly, blocking synaptic activity rapidly induces DHHC2-mediated palmitoylation of PSD-95 and synaptic clustering of PSD-95 and AMPARs (Jeyifous et al., 2016). However, DHHC2 mediates AKAP150 palmitoylation and synaptic lipid raft activity following seizure in vivo (Keith et al., 2012). Yet, it is unclear whether DHHC2 in the BLA is involved in chronic stress-induced emotional behaviours.\nTo address this gap, we utilized chronic stress to induce depressive-like behaviours in mice and performed a series of experiments to investigate the role of AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling in BLA in regulating emotional behaviours. We first confirmed that chronic stress up-regulated protein palmitoylation in the BLA, and pharmacological inhibition of protein palmitoylation reversed depressive-like behaviours in CRS mice. We also found that the  S1.\n**| Animals**\nMale C57BL/6J mice (20 \u00b1 2 g, aged 7-8 weeks) used for experiments were purchased from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China; certificate number: SCXK2017-0005). All animals were group housed under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle with free access to food and water, and the temperature was maintained at 24 \u00b1 2 C.\nMice were allowed to habituate to the environment for at least 1 week before experiments were performed. All the experiments were conducted under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Fujian Medical University. Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines (Percie du Sert et al., 2020) and with the recommendations made by the British Journal of Pharmacology (Lilley et al., 2020).\n**| Chronic stress model**\n**| CRS model**\nThe CRS model was performed as described previously (Zhou et al., 2019). Briefly, to establish this animal model, 50-ml conical polypropylene tubes, which contained numerous holes for breathing, were used to limit the activity of mice. Mice were immobilized in the tube once for 4 h from 17:00 to 21:00 per day and had no access to any food or water during the restraint period. Then, mice were released to their home cages for 20 h and allowed access to food and water. This restraint stress cycle lasted for 21 consecutive days, and the nonstressed mice were untouched in their home cages.\n**| Chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model**\nCUMS model is an animal model commonly used to simulate the core behavioural characteristics of human depression and was performed based on a previously described procedure with minor modification (M. X. Li et al., 2018). In detail, mice were subjected to a variable and unpredictable sequence of mild stressors, including food or water deprivation lasting for 24 h, overnight exposure to illumination, being placed on cold ice for 5 min, damp bedding for 24 h, placement in a tilted cage for 24 h, tail clipping for 1 min, physical restraint for 2 h, foot shock for 30 min, noise exposure for 2 h and shaking for 1 h.\nOne stressor was applied randomly every day for a span of 4 weeks.\n**| Behavioural assessments**\n**| Sucrose preference test (SPT)**\nSPT was performed as described previously (M. X. Li et al., 2018). In detail, after CRS or CUMS modelling, the mice were allowed to drink two bottles, one of which contained 1% sucrose solution and the other contained drinking water. Mice were individually housed and given 1% sucrose solution and drinking water for 24-h adaptation without food, and the bottles were interchanged after another 24 h.\nAfter adaptation for 48 h, the mice were deprived of water for 12 h.\nAt the beginning of testing, two bottles were weighed and then were placed on each cage with the tips of the two bottles as close together as possible, and the positions of two bottles were interchanged after 12 h to test continually for another 12 h. Lastly, the weights of two bottles were recorded again, and the sucrose preference was calculated as the fraction of the sucrose solution compared with the total amount of consumed liquid.\n**| Tail suspension test (TST)**\nTST was performed as described previously (Steru et al., 1985).\nBriefly, TST was considered to mirror despair/depressive-like behaviours by recording the time spent immobile. In brief, mouse was suspended from a horizontal bar at a height of 20 cm through a tape affixed 1 cm from the tip of tail. A camera linked to a computer was used to record the activity of mice. Mice were considered to be immobile when they exhibited no body movement and hung passively for 3 s, and the stationary time during the test of 6 min was quantified.\n**| Forced swimming test (FST)**\nFST was performed as described previously (M. X. Li et al., 2018).\nBriefly, in this test, each mouse was placed into a transparent cylinder (35 cm in height, 15 cm in diameter), and the cylinder was filled with 23-25 C water to a depth of 20 cm, which could avoid the hind legs of mice from touching the bottom. A camera linked to a computer was used to record the activity of mice. All mice were forced to swim for 6 min, and the immobility time during the final 5-min interval of the test was recorded. Behavioural despair was defined as the mouse floating in the water without struggling, and the time spent floating was recorded as the immobility time.\n**| Elevated plus maze (EPM) test**\nEPM test was performed as described previously (Shen et al., 2019).\nThe apparatus of EPM is elevated 40 cm above the floor, and it con- \n**| Open field test (OFT)**\nOFT was performed as described previously (Beilharz & Cox, 1967). This apparatus contained a 50 \u00c2 50 cm clear plastic arena, surrounded by walls that were 40 cm high, the centre field was defined as the 30 \u00c2 30 cm region in the centre of plastic arena, around this field was the peripheral field. Each mouse was gently placed in the \n**| Acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay**\nThe ABE assay was performed as described previously (M. D. Li et al., 2023;Wan et al., 2007). In detail, tissue samples were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50-mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150-mM NaCl, 2-mM EDTA and 50-mM NaF; 10 \u03bcl for 1-mg tissue) with protease inhibitors phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, 0.1 M) and phosphatase inhibitors (PI, 1 M) (RIPA: PMSF: PI = 98:1:1) and reacted on ice for 30 min. After fully homogenizing, the samples were centrifuged (4 C, 12000 g, 20 min) to collect supernatant. Then, MMTS (2 M) was added into the supernatant (final concentration: 20 mM) and reacted without light at 50 C for 30 min after thoroughly mixing. Four times volume of precold acetone were added and mixed thoroughly and then quiesced for 30 min at \u00c020 C and centrifuged (4 C, 12000 g, 20 min) to remove residual MMTS. The protein precipitate was dissolved with lysis buffer, and HPDP-biotin and hydroxylamine (HA) were added into the sample protein buffer to incubate on a table concentrator (25 C, 2 h). The proteins were added with four times volume of precold acetone and centrifuged (4 C, 12000 g) for 20 min. Then, the protein precipitation was dissolved in lysis buffer, and HPDP-biotin were added into the protein precipitation to incubate for 2 h at room temperature; the steps of adding acetone, centrifugation and resuspending was repeated. Then, the purified biotin-labelled palmitoylated proteins were separated by streptavidin-agarose column. After 8-10 cycles, the protein sample was completely cleared and was then washed with the lysis buffer three times. Lastly, after adding the elution buffer (4\u00c2 protein loading buffer: RIPA = 1:3) to denature at 95 C for 30 min, the separated samples were collected and stored at \u00c020 C.\n**| Surface biotinylation assay**\nTissue samples were mixed with ice-cold aCSF containing EZ-link Suifo-NHS-LC Biotin (1 mg\u00c1ml \u00c01 ) with gentle shaking at 4 C for 2 h. Following biotinylation, 100-mM glycine was added to quench the reaction via incubation on ice for 30 min. Then, the samples were washed three times with cold aCSF to remove excess glycine. Lastly, the samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors PMSF (1%) and PI (1%) and then centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min at 4 C. Coomassie blue protein-binding assay (Nanjing Jiancheng Institute of Biological Engineering, Nanjing, China) was used to analyse the protein concentration of the supernatants after centrifugation, and then the supernatants were incubated with streptavidin for 4 h at 4 C. Lastly, streptavidin-protein complexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 4000 g for 3 min at 4 C. After separation from the beads, target proteins were denatured by SDS-loading buffer at 95 C for 10 min for western blotting.\n**| Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay**\nSamples were lysed in the lysis buffer (in mM: 150 NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 50 NaF, 1 Na 3 VO 4 , 6 Na-deoxyoholate, 3 Na-pyrophosphate, 1% PMSF, 1% PI) and homogenized for 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 12000 g for 15 min at 4 C. Supernatants (500 \u03bcg) were incubated with 2 \u03bcg of AKAP150 antibody at 4 C overnight with gentle shaking. Antibody-antigen complex beads were precipitated by incubating the sample with 50-\u03bcl settled Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3-4 h at 4 C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 3 min and washed three times with washing buffer (containing 10-mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100-mM NaCl, 1-mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and 0.1% Triton X-100). Finally, proteins were released from the beads with 50 \u03bcl of SDS-loading buffer, and then boiled at 95 C for 5 min before the eluents were analysed by western blotting method.\n**| Synaptic fractionation**\nSyn-PER Synaptic Protein Extract Reagent was used to extract the synaptic fractionation. Briefly, samples were homogenized with Syn-PER Reagent (10 ml\u00c1mg \u00c01 ) and centrifuged at 1200 g for 10 min at 4 C. The supernatant was then collected into a new tube to centrifuge at 15000 g for 20 min at 4 C. After centrifugation, synaptosome pellet was lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with protease inhibitors cocktail and analysed by western blotting method.\n**| Western blotting**\nSamples were added and homogenized in RIPA buffer (50-mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150-mM NaCl, 2-mM EDTA and 50-mM NaF; 10 \u03bcl\u00c1mg \u00c01 ) with protease inhibitors PMSF (1%) and PI (1%). Then the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12000 g for 15 min at 4 C, and the supernatant protein concentration was measured via Coomassie blue protein-binding assay, using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. Lastly, the collected supernatants were added with SDS-loading buffer and heated at 95 C for 5 min. The lysates were separated via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and then transferred to PVDF membranes.\nMembranes were incubated in blocking buffer (5% BSA in Trisbuffered saline, w/v; pH 7.4 and 1% Tween-20, TBST) at room temperature for 2 h before being incubated in primary antibody solutions (1% BSA and primary antibodies with adequate dilution in TBST) overnight at 4 C. The blots were washed three times at room temperature for 20 min with TBST and incubated in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibody solutions (1% BSA and secondary antibodies in TBST) at room temperature for 2 h. After washing three times at room temperature for 20 min with TBST, they were reacted with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Super Signal West Pico; Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) for about 5 min or more time and captured into the Micro Chemi (DNR Bio-imaging systems, Jerusalem, Israel). The optical densities of the immunoblots were measured by NIH ImageJ software. Each group result was normalized by its corresponding \u03b2-actin, and all of the results were presented as the percentage of control following normalization. Detailed information about antibodies used is shown in Table S2. The Immuno-related procedures used comply with the recommendations made by the British Journal of Pharmacology (Alexander et al., 2018).\n**| Stereotactic injections**\nMice were anaesthetised with 2% isoflurane and placed on a stereotactic apparatus (RWD Life Science, China). The hair on skulls of mice was shaved with scissors, and the skin was cut along the centre line.\nSmall craniotomy holes were made above the BF after location according to the bregma. For microinjection of AAV-eGFP and AAV-DHHC2 into the BLA region, the virus was stereotaxically delivered directly into the BLA (AP = 1.7 mm, ML = 3.4 mm, DV = 4.2 mm) at a slow rate (0.1 \u03bcl\u00c1min \u00c01 ) using a digital stereotaxic frame with a microsyringe pump (RWD Life Science, China). Mice were given metamizole (100 mg/kg) for postoperative pain and gentamicin (5 mg/kg).\nMice were returned to home cages and were observed every day until behavioural testing was performed. Placement of surgical injection sites were confirmed by GFP immunohistochemistry, and the behavioural tests were performed after 5 weeks. For microinjection of Ht-31 or 2-BP into the BLA region, two stainless steel cannulas with a length of 10 mm and an outside diameter of 0.6 mm were bilaterally implanted into the core of the BLA region and secured to the skull with steel jeweller's screws and dental acrylic; after 1 week, the Ht-31 (50 \u03bcM, dissolved in aCSF) or 2-BP (0.5 mM, dissolved in aCSF containing 0.01% DMSO) was injected into the BLA at a rate of 0.5 \u03bcl\u00c1min \u00c01 with a total volume of 0.5 \u03bcl per side using a microsyringe (1 \u03bcl) connected by a PE-10 polyethylene tubing to a needle, which was introduced into the brain region through the cannula fixed, and the behavioural tests were performed 30 min after microinjection.\nThe amino acid sequence information of Ht-31 and CP is shown in Table S3.\n**| Statistical analysis**\nAll analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. All statistical results and tests used are included in the figure legends. Required sample sizes were estimated based on prior work. Data were analysed with independent-samples two-tailed t test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or two-way ANOVA, as appropriate. Post-hoc tests were run only if F achieved P<0.05 and there was no significant variance inhomogeneity. Differences at P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data and statistical analysis complied with the recommendations of the British Journal of Pharmacology on experimental design and analysis in pharmacology (Curtis et al., 2022).\n**| Nomenclature of targets and ligands**\nKey protein targets and ligands in this article are hyperlinked to corresponding entries in http://www.guidetopharmacology.org and are permanently archived in the Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2021/2022 (Alexander, Fabbro, et al., 2023;Alexander, Mathie, et al., 2023).\n**| RESULTS**\n**| Protein palmitoylation in the BLA modulates depressive-like behaviours in mice**\nProtein palmitoylation has been found to be involved in emotional disorders (Gorinski et al., 2019;Oota-Ishigaki et al., 2022), and a previous study showed that protein palmitoylation was increased in the whole brain after CRS (Zareba-Koziol et al., 2019). How about protein palmitoylation in the BLA after CRS? And what is the underlying mechanism? Thus, to characterize protein palmitoylation in depressive-like behaviours, we exposed C57 mice to CRS and detected the depressive-like behaviours by SPT, TST and FST (Figure S1A-D).\nThen, we detected the protein palmitoylation in the BLA by the ABE assay, and as the western blots of streptavidin-labelled proteins showed, there was a significant increase in the content of palmitoylated proteins in the BLA of CRS mice (Figure 1a). Furthermore, we also exposed the mice to CUMS, another animal model of depression (Figure S2A-D). Consistent with CRS model, CUMS exposure elevated the protein palmitoylation level in the BLA (Figure 1b). Additionally, we injected LPS (1 mg\u00c1kg \u00c01 , i.p.) to mice for 5 days to induce depressive-like behaviours (Figure S3A-D), and interestingly, LPS exposure significantly up-regulated protein palmitoylation level in the BLA (Figure 1c). These results suggest that protein palmitoylation may be an important target for depressive-like behaviours in mice.\nTo further verify the role of protein palmitoylation in depressivelike behaviours, we used 2-BP, a palmitoylation inhibitor, to examine whether the decrease in protein palmitoylation could reverse depressive-like behaviours induced by CRS. After confirmation of microinjection site in the BLA (Figure S4A,B), we found that 2-BP treatment did not cause an anxiolytic effect in the Ctrl groups, and it abolished CRS-induced anxiety-like behaviours in the CRS groups, including fewer open arm entries, shorter open arm distance and duration, but produced no effect on locomotion activity (Figure 1d). A similar anxiolytic effect was observed in the OFT (Figure 1e). Furthermore, we also found that 2-BP reversed the increased immobility time induced by CRS exposure in the TST (Figure 1f) but did not change the immobility time in the Ctrl groups. In addition, a similar result was detected in the FST (Figure 1g). Considering that the BLA serves as a central neural substrate underlying anxiety and fearrelated disorders, and emerging evidences have revealed that stress induces BLA glutamatergic neuronal network hyperexcitability (Masneuf et al., 2014;Wu et al., 2022), to ask whether protein palmitoylation mediate depressive-like behaviours by altering the synaptic transmission in the BLA, we treated the BLA slice from the Ctrl and CRS groups with 2-BP and recorded the mEPSCs in the BLA. As expected, CRS exposure augmented the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs, and these effects were nearly abolished by 2-BP treatment (Figure 1h-j). Together, these results suggest that protein palmitoylation contributes to depressive-like behaviours through altering the synaptic transmission in the BLA.\n**| CRS promotes AKAP150 signalling through palmitoylation in the BLA**\nOur previous results have shown that AKAP150 signalling in the BLA contributes to depressive-like behaviours induced by CRS (Zhou et al., 2019), and palmitoylation controls AKAP79 assembly of signalling complexes containing PKA, CaN and SAP97 at endosomes (Purkey et al., 2018). However, the regulatory mechanism of AKAP150 signalling in the process of CRS remains unclear. To address this issue, we performed the ABE assay and found that there was a significant increase in AKAP150 expression and AKAP150 palmitoylation level in the BLA after CRS (Figure 2a,b). Interestingly, PSD-95, an important palmitoylation target, showed a reduced palmitoylation level in the BLA, with no difference in its expression level following CRS (Figure 2a,c). Furthermore, we also observed similar results in the model of CUMS, including increased expression of AKAP150 and its palmitoylation level and decreased PSD-95 palmitoylation level in the BLA (Figure 2d-f), indicating that chronic stress elevates AKAP150 function probably by regulating its palmitoylation in the BLA.\nTo further confirm the findings described above, we treated the BLA slices from the Ctrl and CRS groups with 2-BP and found that 2-BP reversed the increased AKAP150 palmitoylation and synaptic expression induced by CRS, but with little influence on its total expression (Figure 2g,h1-h3). Moreover, we examined AKAP150 downstream targets PKA and CaN, and as the results of Co-IP experiment showed, 2-BP abolished the binding of AKAP150 and PKA induced by CRS (Figure 2i,j), while CRS did not alter the interaction between AKAP150 and CaN as well as the expression and synaptic level of CaN (Figure 2i,k1-k3). Furthermore, 2-BP also reversed the increased synaptic expressions of PKA and phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA) induced by CRS in the BLA, with little influence on PKA expression and CRS-induced total expression of p-PKA (Figure 2l-n).\nLastly, we examined the delivery of GluA1 and found that CRSmediated surface expression and Ser-845 phosphorylation of GluA1 were abolished by 2-BP, and CRS or/and 2-BP did not affect the total expression and Ser-831 phosphorylation of GluA1 (Figure S5A,B). This indicates that chronic stress induces AKAP150 palmitoylation in the BLA, thus promoting AKAP150 to selectively anchor PKA. Together, our findings show that CRS-mediated palmitoylation promotes AKAP150 signalling in the BLA.\n**| AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling facilitates synaptic transmission in the BLA**\nHyperexcitability of the BLA principal neurons plays a causal role in the chronic stress induced depressive-like behaviours (Asim et al., 2023;Rosenkranz et al., 2010); therefore, we asked whether AKAP150 palmitoylation mediates the increased excitability of principal neurons in the BLA after CRS. To confirm this, we constructed a well-characterized interference peptide Ht-31 to disrupt the binding of AKAP150 and PKA according to previous reports (Kurihara   et al., 2000;Vijayaraghavan et al., 1997). First, we incubated the slice from the Ctrl and CRS groups of mice with Ht-31 or its inactive CP and then performed the ABE, synaptic fractionation and Co-IP assays. As expected, Ht-31 treatment did not change AKAP150 palmitoylation, synaptic expression and total expression levels induced by CRS (Figure 3a,b1,b2). Then we found that the CRS-mediated increased binding of AKAP150 and PKA was abolished by treating with Ht-31, and the elevated synaptic expression of PKA was also reversed by Ht-31 treatment (Figure 3c-e). Additionally, we further tested the effects of Ht-31 on p-PKA and observed that there was a significant increase in synaptic expression of p-PKA in the BLA after CRS, which was abolished by incubating with Ht-31 that had no significant influence on p-PKA expression (Figure S6A,B). Furthermore, we also examined the action of Ht-31 on GluA1 in the BLA after CRS, and as the results showed, CRS raised the surface expression and Ser-845 phosphorylation level of GluA1, which was also reversed by Ht-31 incubation (Figure 3f,g). These findings show that palmitoylation promotes GluA1 surface expression via AKAP150 signalling in the BLA after CRS.\nTo directly validate the role of AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling in synaptic transmission in the BLA, we recorded the mEPSCs and LTP after CRS and/or Ht-31 incubation and observed an obvious increase in the amplitude of mEPSC, which was abolished by Ht-31, while both CRS and Ht-31 incubation did not influence the frequency (Figure 3h-j). In addition, our fEPSP recordings from BLA slices showed that CRS enhanced fEPSP slopes, and Ht-31 treatment at slice level significantly attenuated the CRS-induced LTP enhancement (Figure 3k,l). Lastly, we microinjected the CP or Ht-31 into the BLA region and then tested the depressive-like behaviours in mice by TST and FST. As the TST results showed, CRS exposure increased the immobility time, and Ht-31 microinjection diminished this tendency (Figure 3m), and a similar result was observed in the FST (Figure 3n), indicating that chronic stress enhances AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling to increase the synaptic transmission in the BLA (Figure 3o).\nTogether, these findings suggest that disrupting the interaction between AKAP150 and PKA abolishes depressive-like behaviours and the AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling-mediated synaptic transmission in the BLA after CRS.\n**| DHHC2 mediates the AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling in the stressed mice**\nPrevious study reported that DHHC2, a palmitoyl acyltransferase, as a regulator of AKAP79/150 palmitoylation signalling, is crucial for postsynaptic regulation of recycling endosome function (Woolfrey et al., 2015); thus, we asked whether DHHC2 mediates AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling in the BLA after chronic stress. First, we examined the expression and activity of DHHC2, which was monitored by its auto-palmitoylation (Wang et al., 2020), and found that CRS upregulated the activity and expression of DHHC2 in the BLA (Figure 4a,b). Additionally, similar results were observed in the model of CUMS (Figure 4c,d). To further examine this, AAV-DHHC2, an adeno-associated virus (AAV), was delivered into the BLA to knockdown DHHC2 gene expression. The microinjected site was identified by immunofluorescence, and the silencing efficiency was 64% (Figure 4e).\nNext, we carried out the ABE and synaptic fractionation assays, and the results indicated that DHHC2 knockdown resulted in a descending tendency on the palmitoylation level of AKAP150, as well as its synaptic expression in the BLA after CRS, with little influence on its total expression (Figure 4f-h). Moreover, we observed that DHHC2 knockdown abolished the synaptic expression of PKA induced by CRS but did not affect its total expression (Figure 4i,j). In line with this, DHHC2 knockdown also reversed the CRS-induced increased association between AKAP150 and PKA (Figure S7A-D). In addition, we checked the effect of DHHC2 on the synaptic expression of p-PKA in the BLA after CRS, and similar with result of PKA, DHHC2 knockdown attenuated the synaptic expression of p-PKA induced by CRS (Figure 4k,l). Lastly, the role of DHHC2 in GluA1 function after CRS was tested, and as the results showed, there were obviously increased levels in the surface expression and Ser-845 phosphorylation of GluA1 after CRS, and these enhancements were abolished by the knockdown of DHHC2 (Figure 4m,n), indicating that DHHC2 mediates the delivery of GluA1 by AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling in the BLA after CRS (Figure 4o). Together, these findings show that DHHC2 mediates the AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling in the BLA after CRS.\nF I G U R E 3 Hyperpalmitoylation of AKAP150 mediates synaptic transmission in the BLA.

Thus, we wondered whether DHHC2 knockdown in the BLA prevents the CRSinduced depressive-like behaviours. The mice were microinjected with AAV-eGFP or AAV-DHHC2 into the BLA region, then the CRS procedure was performed after recovery and the depressive-like behaviours were tested by SPT, TST and FST, and lastly, the mEPSCs and LTP in the BLA were recorded (Figure 5a). The results showed that DHHC2 knockdown in the BLA restored the CRS-induced deficits in sucrose preference and reduced immobility duration in the TST and FST (Figure 5b-d). Further, we measured AMPAR-mediated mEPSCs using whole-cell patch-clamp recording in the BLA slices and found that the increased amplitude induced by CRS was abolished by the knockdown of DHHC2 in the BLA (Figure 5e-g). Additionally, our fEPSP recordings from BLA slices showed that CRS enhanced fEPSP slopes, and DHHC2 knockdown at slice level significantly attenuated CRSinduced LTP enhancement (Figure 5h,i). Collectively, our results demonstrated that chronic stress preferentially induces AKAP150 palmitoylation, not PSD-95 palmitoylation, in the BLA, followed by activation of AKAP150 signalling, which triggers the anchoring and activation of PKA to regulate the phosphorylation and synaptic expression level of GluA1 and therefore alters the synaptic transmission and induces depressive-like behaviours in mice (Figure 5j).\n**| DISCUSSION**\nIn this paper, we show a previously unsuspected role of DHHC2-mediated AKAP150 palmitoylation in depressive-like behaviours. Hyperexcitability of the BLA was closely associated with emotional disorders, particularly depressive disorders, which was the primary focus of our analysis. We demonstrated that chronic stress increased the protein palmitoylation in the BLA, and blocking the protein palmitoylation reversed depressive-like behaviours induced by CRS. Importantly, AKAP150, not PSD-95, was identified as the substrate of DHHC2 that was contributed to depressive-like behaviours in mice. Disrupting the interaction of AKAP150 and PKA with Ht-31 abolished the effects of AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling in the BLA. Lastly, the DHHC2 expression and palmitoylation levels were increased in the BLA after CRS, and DHHC2 knockdown reversed the depressive-like behaviours, as well as the synaptic transmission in the BLA, suggesting that DHHC2 and its palmitoylation signal may represent an endogenous antidepressant target.\nProtein palmitoylation has been reported to regulate neuronal protein stability, sorting and trafficking, subsequently changing the synaptic targeting and functional efficiency of substrate proteins (el-Husseini Ael & Bredt, 2002;Ho et al., 2011;Linder & Deschenes, 2007). Here, we found that chronic stress or LPS exposure up-regulated the protein palmitoylation level in the BLA, while our previous results have shown that deficiency in palmitoylation signal in the BLA generates a high-anxious state in rats (Shen et al., 2019). Are these results contradictory? BLA is a central neural substrate for emotion disorders, such as anxiety, fear and related negative moods (Adhikari et al., 2015;Keifer et al., 2015), and hyperexcitability of BLA indicates that there is an increase in pyramidal neuron activity (Rau et al., 2015). In addition, protein palmitoylation was changed along with the alteration of neuronal activity, for example, blocking synaptic activity rapidly induces PSD-95 palmitoylation and mediates synaptic clustering of PSD-95 and associated AMPA-type glutamate receptors (Noritake et al., 2009). In contrast, AKAP150 palmitoylation and its association with synaptic lipid raft increased following seizure activity in vivo (Carvalho-Rosa et al., 2023) level of PSD-95 (Ho et al., 2011). These previous findings suggest that acute or single stimulation induces protein depalmitoylation physiologically, while chronic or continuous stimulation increases protein palmitoylation. Thus, we speculated that the possible explanation for this ambivalence might be that the continuous hyperactivity in BLA neurons contributes to protein palmitoylation in depressive-like behaviours while rapid increase in synaptic activity induces depalmitoylation in anxiety-like behaviours.\nPKA anchored to the scaffold AKAP150 plays a key role in regulating GluA1 Ser-845 phosphorylation to control CP-AMPAR recruitment at hippocampal synapses during LTP (Sanderson et al., 2018), and infusion peptide Ht-31 to the amygdala, inhibiting PKA anchoring to AKAP150, impairs memory consolidation of auditory conditioning (Moita et al., 2002). In addition, direct evidence shows that AKAP150 is strongly expressed in mouse brain regions involved in learning and memory, and an up-regulated level of AKAP150 contributes to processing exposure to a novel context and associative learning (Nijholt et al., 2007;Ostroveanu et al., 2007). Our previous results also showed that AKAP150-PKA complex plays important roles in AMPAR-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in the BLA under CRS (Zhou et al., 2019). However, the underlying mechanism of AKAP150 in memory and stress-related LTP is still unknown. Previous finding revealed that palmitoylation is required for localization of the AKAP150 signalling complex in endosomes but not the plasma membrane (Purkey et al., 2018). However, palmitoylation promotes AKAP150-mediated GluR1 surface delivery and exocytosis from the recycling endosomes (Y. Li et al., 2021), suggesting that although palmitoylation does not directly target AKAP150 to the plasma membrane, it facilitates endosomes recycling and subsequent AKAP150 signalling during LTP. Here, we found that chronic stress up-regulated AKAP150 expression and palmitoylation levels in the BLA, and blocking the AKAP150-PKA interaction with Ht-31 abolished the AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling, indicating that palmitoylation plays an important role in regulating AKAP150 signalling. DHHC2, a palmitoyl acyltransferase, mediates the palmitoylation of PSD-95 and AKAP150 (Matt et al., 2019;Woolfrey et al., 2015); however, the underlying mechanisms are totally different. For instance, upon synaptic activity blockade, DHHC2 translocates to the postsynaptic density to induce PSD-95 palmitoylation and mediates synaptic clustering of PSD-95 (Noritake et al., 2009). Otherwise, following seizure activity in vivo, DHHC2 interacts with and palmitoylates AKAP150 and targets it to postsynaptic lipid rafts and dendritic recycling endosomes (Keith et al., 2012). Interestingly, the effects of PSD-95 and AKAP150 palmitoylation on AMPA receptors, particularly GluA1, are similar. Palmitoylation promotes PSD-95 clustering at the postsynaptic density; subsequently, palmitoylated PSD-95 increases the surface expression of AMPA receptors by interacting with stargazing (Han et al., 2015). For AKAP150, palmitoylation facilitates the localization of the AKAP150 signalling complex in endosomes and further induces the localization to dendritic recycling endosomes in neurons, and lastly, AKAP150 anchors PKA or CaN to regulate the phosphorylation and surface delivery of GluA1 (Sanderson et al., 2012). Here, we found that DHHC2 expression and palmitoylation levels were increased in the BLA after chronic stress, and the expression of AKAP150 and its palmitoylation level were also increased, while there was no significant change in PSD-95 expression but decreased PSD-95 palmitoylation level, indicating that chronic stress up-regulated the function of DHHC2, and DHHC2 preferentially palmitoylated AKAP150, not PSD-95, to regulate GluA1 clustering at synapse.\nIn this study, we verified that protein palmitoylation is required for chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviours, and 2-BP treatment reversed the increased palmitoylation level, synaptic transmission and depressive-like behaviours. Although we identified that AKAP150 palmitoylation plays a critical role in regulating chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviours, 2-BP, as an inhibitor of palmitoylation, lacks selectivity on its substrates, so it would be appropriate to investigate its specificity using mass spectrum for palmitoylated proteins. In addition, palmitoylation/depalmitoylation dynamically modulates AKAP150 signalling in the BLA, and we have shown that palmitoylation promotes AKAP150 signalling to induce synaptic transmission and depressive-like behaviours. However, identification and biological characteristics of the AKAP150 palmitoylation and depalmitoylation enzymes are still unknown, and these questions remain to be verified.\nIn conclusion, our results provide evidence that AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling principally mediates chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviours in mice, and DHHC2 knockdown in the BLA abolishes the increased synaptic transmission and depressive-like behaviours induced by chronic stress. These findings also indicate that palmitoylation cycling, DHHC2-mediated AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling and subsequently the selective regulation of membrane F I G U R E 5 DHHC2 knockdown in the BLA reverses chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviours and synaptic transmission. \n\n\nBackground and Purpose: Protein palmitoylation is involved in learning and memory, and in emotional disorders. Yet, the underlying mechanisms in these processes remain unclear. Herein, we describe that A-kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150) is essential and sufficient for depressive-like behaviours in mice via a palmitoylationdependent mechanism.Experimental Approach: Depressive-like behaviours in mice were induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Palmitoylated proteins in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) were assessed by an acyl-biotin exchange assay.Genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to investigate the role of the DHHC2-mediated AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling pathway in depressive-like behaviours. Electrophysiological recording, western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to define the mechanistic pathway.Key Results: Chronic stress successfully induced depressive-like behaviours in mice and enhanced AKAP150 palmitoylation in the BLA, and a palmitoylation inhibitor was enough to reverse these changes. Blocking the AKAP150-PKA interaction with the peptide Ht-31 abolished the CRS-induced AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling pathway. DHHC2 expression and palmitoylation levels were both increased after chronic stress. DHHC2 knockdown prevented CRS-induced depressive-like behaviours, as well as attenuating AKAP150 signalling and synaptic transmission in the BLA in CRS-treated mice.\nConclusion and Implications:These results delineate that DHHC2 modulates chronic stress-induced depressive-like behaviours and synaptic transmission in the BLA via the AKAP150 palmitoylation signalling pathway, and this pathway may be considered as a promising novel therapeutic target for major depressive disorder.\n\n",
