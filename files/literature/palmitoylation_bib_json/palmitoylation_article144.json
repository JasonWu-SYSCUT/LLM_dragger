Mechanistically, injury triggers the translocation of CD36 in MuSCs, which relies on dynamic palmitoylation of STX11. Palmitoylation facilitates the formation of STX11/SNAP23/VAMP4 SANRE complex, which stimulates the fusion of CD36- and STX11-containing vesicles.

    "fullText": "**INTRODUCTION**\nFatty acids (FAs) are essential nutrients involved in various cellular activities, including b-oxidation, energy storage, membrane synthesis, lipid hormones synthesis, and lipid modification. 1 Uptake of FAs across the plasma membrane (PM) is the first step for their metabolism. 2 Although almost all tissues are capable of using FAs, they uptake FAs in response to different physiological conditions or stimuli. 3 It remains largely unknown how context-specific FA uptake is achieved.\nCD36 is a transmembrane protein that directly binds FAs 4 and facilitates FA uptake in many tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. [5][6][7][8] CD36 is a palmitoylated protein, 9 and it is palmitoylated by the Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC)motif-containing acyltransferases DHHC4 and DHHC5. 10 We have previously shown that in adipocytes, dynamic palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of CD36 provide a key regulatory mechanism for its FA uptake activity. 10,11 Palmitoylation is required for targeting CD36 to the PM to capture extracellular FAs, 10 whereas binding of FAs to CD36 triggers its depalmitoylation that facilitates endocytosis of FAs through the LYN/SYK/ JNK signaling pathway. 11 As CD36 is essential for FA uptake in many types of cells, 1 theoretically the activity of CD36 should be differentially regulated in different cells; however, little is known about cell-type-specific regulation of CD36.\nSkeletal muscle is the largest organ in our body, and it goes through constant self-renewal to maintain muscle mass. After muscle injury, muscle stem cells (MuSCs, also called satellite cells) switch from quiescent to proliferating state for muscle repair. 12,13 Activated MuSCs undergo remarkably metabolic shifts to meet the energy demands for rapid proliferation. 14,15 Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is essential for maintaining the regenerative competence of MuSCs for an effective energy production. 16 Yet, it remains unclear about the sources of the nutrients and how they are sensed and utilized by MuSCs.\nHere, in both humans and mice, we observed an increase in plasma FAs after muscle injury. We demonstrated that FAs (legend continued on next page) were mobilized from adipose tissue and dietary fat to promote muscle regeneration by functioning as both fuels and signal molecules. Furthermore, we identified the regulatory mechanism of injury-induced FA uptake in MuSCs. We showed that muscle injury induced the translocation of CD36 from cytosol to the PM and demonstrated a critical role of palmitoylated STX11 in the process. Our findings uncovered the critical role of FAs in muscle regeneration and the regulatory mechanism of injurydependent FA uptake in MuSCs.\n\n**RESULTS**\nFAs mobilized from adipose tissues and dietary fat promote muscle regeneration After muscle injury, MuSCs rapidly proliferate to repair damaged muscle, and it is an energy-demanding process. 14,15 Recently, lipid droplets were shown to be dynamically accumulated in proliferating MuSCs, and blocking biogenesis or lipolysis of the lipid droplets inhibited muscle regeneration. 17 We hypothesized that FAs might play a potential role in muscle regeneration. To test the hypothesis, we performed muscle injury in mice using barium chloride (BaCl 2 ) or cardiotoxin (CTX), two commonly used muscle injury reagents, 18 and monitored the changes in plasma FAs and fat mass every 3 days (Figure 1A). In both models, plasma FAs significantly increased on day 3 and returned to normal on day 6 after injury (Figures 1B andS1A). Meanwhile, there was a significant drop in fat mass after muscle injury (4% in BaCl 2 -treated group, and 2% in CTX-treated group), and it gradually recovered in 24 days (Figures 1B andS1A). These results indicate that muscle injury induces the mobilization of FAs from adipose tissues.\nWe next asked whether the mobilized FAs were uptaken by the damaged muscle for repair. We performed a more-detailed curve by collecting plasma and muscle samples on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 after muscle injury. Consistent with the increased level of plasma FAs, there was an accumulation of triglycerides in the damaged muscle, peaking on day 3 (Figure 1C). Lipidomic analysis revealed that many lipid species were dynamically accumulated in the damaged muscle (Figure S1B; Table S1), which was further illustrated by the triglyceride species (Figure 1D).\nTo further confirm the results, we performed eccentric exercise, which can efficiently induce muscle damage in human, 19 in 8 volunteers. As MuSC activity peaks around 48 h after damaging exercise, 20 we collected plasma at 0, 3, 24, and 48 h after the exercise and subjected to lipidomic analysis (Figure 1E; Table S2). There was no clear change in other lipid species such as triglycerides and phospholipids (Figure S1C), while many species of plasma FAs dramatically increased at 3 h, dropped at 24 h, but increased again at 48 h post-exercise (Figure 1F). These results were further validated by a direct measurement of plasma FAs (Figure 1G). Therefore, FAs might play a role in muscle regeneration in mice and humans.\nTo verify that adipose tissue is the source of FAs, we first performed muscle injury and regeneration in Fsp27 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, which have a very small amount of fat mass. 21,22 In wild-type (WT) mice, large amounts of nascent myofibers (eMyHC + ) were observed on day 3.5 after muscle injury, and the number decreased afterward. On day 5.5, regenerated myofibers (Dystrophin + , or centrally nucleated fibers) were readily observed. On day 14, more mature myofibers were observed, and by day 28, muscle regeneration was finished (Figures 1H,1I, S1D, and S1E). However, in Fsp27 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, the occurrence of both nascent and regenerated myofibers was delayed by 2 days (Figures 1H and1I). Quantification of Dystrophin + myoblasts showed that Fsp27 \u00c0/\u00c0 muscles had smaller regenerated area on days 7 and 14 compared with WT muscles (Figure S1E). On day 28, there was no difference between the two groups (Figure S1E). Consistent with the decreased fat mass, plasma level of FAs and muscle triglyceride content were significantly lower in Fsp27 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice on day 3.5 (Figure 1J).\nTo further confirm the results, we limited the supply of FAs by blocking lipolysis of adipose tissue with acipimox 23 and performed muscle injury. As shown in Figures S1F-S1I, acipimox treatment blocked damaged-induced increase in plasma level of FAs and muscle triglyceride content on day 3.5 and significantly slowed down muscle regeneration.\nWe then investigated whether dietary supplementation of FAs could accelerate muscle regeneration. We performed muscle injury in chow-fed mice and switched to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding afterward (Figure 1K). Compared with chow feeding, acute HFD feeding significantly accelerated muscle regeneration, as illustrated by earlier occurrence of nascent and regenerated myofibers and larger myofibers on day 6 (Figures 1L-1N, S1J, and S1K).\nTaken together, these results indicate that FAs mobilized from adipose tissues and dietary fat are the essential nutrient for muscle regeneration (Figure 1O).\n**FAs function as more than fuels to promote MuSC proliferation**\nAs MuSCs are key players in muscle regeneration, we hypothesized that FAs might be uptaken by MuSCs to support muscle regeneration. We performed muscle injury in one hindlimb of a mouse and used the other one as a control (Figure 2A). We (C and D) Muscle injury was performed as in (A), (n = 4). Plasma NEFA and muscle triglyceride (TG) content were measured at the indicated time (C). Muscle lipids were extracted for lipidomic analysis. A heatmap of representative TG species is shown in (D). (E-G) Eight volunteers performed a 3-h eccentric exercise. Blood was collected at the indicated time for lipidomic analysis. The heatmap of representative species of FAs is shown in (F). Plasma NEFA was measured (G). (H-J) On day 0, muscle injury was induced in WT and Fsp27 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (8 weeks old, male, n = 3). On the indicated days, soleus was collected for immunostaining analysis with indicated antibodies (H). Quantification of eMyHC + and Dystrophin + myofibers was performed using ImageJ (I). Plasma NEFA and muscle TG content were measured on days 0 and 3.5 after injury (J). (K-N) On day 0, muscle injury was induced in chow-fed C57BL6/J mice (8 weeks old, male, n = 3). Shortly after injury, one group of the mice was kept on chow diet, and the other groups were switched to HFD. At indicated time, soleus was dissected and subjected to immunostaining analysis and quantification. For (H)-(J) and (M), each value represents mean \u00b1 SEM obtained from 3 samples. (O) A schematic illustration that FAs from adipose tissues or dietary fat support muscle regeneration. See also Figure S1. (legend continued on next page) isolated single myofibers and examined the accumulation of triglycerides in MuSCs. Indeed, a strong signal of BODIPY was observed in PAX7 + MuSCs on the damaged myofiber but not in those on control myofiber (Figure 2B), indicating that activated MuSCs uptake and store FAs.\nTo directly test the effect of FAs on MuSC proliferation, we isolated single myofibers from WT C57BL6 mice and found that delipidated FCS (D-FCS) significantly slowed down growth of PAX7 + myoblasts (Figures 2C and2D). Similar observations were made in primary MuSCs isolated from Pax7 GFP mice 24 and C2C12 cells (Figures 2E andS2A).\nWe went on to explore how FAs promote MuSC proliferation. We first treated single myofibers with etomoxir, a CPT1a inhibitor that blocks FA oxidation, and found that it dramatically inhibited growth of PAX7 + myoblasts (Figures 2F and2G). Similar observations were made in primary MuSCs (Figure 2H) and C2C12 cells (Figure S2B). These results indicate that FAs are utilized as fuels.\nWe then asked whether FAs function as more than fuels. Besides long-chain FAs, medium-chain FAs can also be used as energy source. 25 If FAs just function as fuels, both medium-chain and long-chain FAs should be able to accelerate MuSC proliferation. However, when supplemented into D-FCS, oleate (C18:1), but not octanoate (C8:0), significantly increased growth of PAX7 + myoblasts (Figures 2I and2J). Similar observations were made in primary MuSCs and C2C12 cells (Figures 2K andS2C). Furthermore, other long-chain FAs, such as palmitate (C16:0) and arachidonate (C20:4), also accelerated MuSC proliferation (Figure S2D). These results indicate that long-chain FAs are more than fuels to promote MuSC proliferation.\n**FAs trigger a CD36-dependent growth signaling pathway to promote MuSC proliferation**\nTo investigate the fuel-independent function of FAs, we started to identify the key protein that might mediate the effect of FAs. As CD36 has been shown to facilitate FA uptake in skeletal muscles, 5 we subjected Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice to muscle injury. Compared with WT mice, they showed a 2-day delay in muscle regeneration (Figures 3A, 3B, andS3A). Quantification of Dystrophin + myoblasts showed that Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 muscles had smaller regenerated area on days 7, 14, and 28 after injury (Figure S3B). Meanwhile, in WT mice, large amounts of PAX7 + MuSCs were observed on day 3.5, and the number decreased afterward and returned on day 28 (Figures 3D andS3C). However, in Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, the number of PAX7 + MuSCs was much smaller on day 3.5, and it increased on day 5.5 and declined subsequently (Figures 3D andS3C). Due to decreased FA uptake, muscle triglyceride content was lower in Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice on day 3.5 (Figure S3E). Plasma level of FAs was also lower in Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice on day 3.5, probably due to the smaller fat mass. 5 To directly test the effect of CD36 on FA uptake during MuSCs proliferation, we isolated single myofibers from WT and Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice on days 0 and 5.5 and found that injury-induced FA uptake was inhibited in Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 MuSCs (Figure S3F). Furthermore, Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 myoblasts grew significantly slower than WT controls in FCS-containing medium (Figures 3C and3D). Similar observations were made in Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 MuSCs and C2C12 cells (Figures S3G andS3H). These results indicate that CD36 facilitates FA uptake in MuSCs to promote muscle regeneration.\nIn adipocytes and macrophages, binding of ligands to CD36 can activate an SRC family kinase (SFK)/SYK/JNK signaling pathway. 1,11,26 Although they are terminally differentiated cells, these kinases are well-known growth signaling molecules. 27 We thus hypothesized that FAs might trigger a growth signaling pathway in MuSCs. To test the point, we treated WT single myofibers with inhibitors of SFKs (PP2), SYK (entospletinib), or JNK (SP600125), and found that all three inhibitors significantly inhibited growth of PAX7 + myoblasts (Figures 3E and3F). Furthermore, inhibitors of JNK or SYK dramatically inhibited muscle regeneration (Figures 3G, 3H, S3I, and S3J). These results indicate that FAs might trigger an SFK/SYK/JNK signaling pathway to promote muscle regeneration.\nAs there are 8 members in the SFK family, we knocked down each of the 5 SFKs that show relatively abundant expression in C2C12 cells (Figure S3K). Knocking down FYN, not the others, dramatically inhibited growth of C2C12 cells (Figures S3K andS3L). Meanwhile, oleate treatment caused phosphorylation of FYN, SYK, and JNK in control cells but not in CD36 knockdown C2C12 cells (Figures 3I andS3M). Furthermore, oleate-induced phosphorylation of SYK and JNK was significantly lower in Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 primary MuSCs (Figure S3N). These results indicate that FAs trigger a CD36-dependnent FYN/SYK/JNK pathway in MuSCs.\nWe moved on to dissect the two functions of FAs, as fuels and signal molecules. We first knocked down CD36 in C2C12 cells and cultured the cells in D-FCS so that both functions of FAs were disrupted. To recover the function of fuels, we treated cells with octanoate, which does not need CD36 to enter the cells. To recover the function of signal molecules, we artificially activated the signaling pathway by expressing a constitutively active form of FYN (Y531F) or SYK (Y131E). As shown in Figure 3J, treatment with octanoate did not accelerate the growth of CD36 knockdown (C) Single myofibers were isolated from WT C57BL6 mice (8 weeks old, male) and cultured in medium containing FCS or D-FCS for 3 days, followed by immunostaining. (D) Quantification of PAX7 + myoblasts per cluster (n = 17 for FCS-treated group; n = 20 for D-FCS-treated group). (E) On day 0, primary MuSCs were isolated from Pax7-EGFP mice and set up at 8 3 10 3 cells per 35-mm dish in medium containing FCS or D-FCS. Cells were counted every day. (F and G) Single myofibers from WT mice were cultured in FCS containing medium supplemented with DMSO or etomoxir (40 mM) for 3 days, followed by immunostaining and quantification (n = 16 for DMSO-treated group; n = 17 for etomoxir-treated group). (H) Primary MuSCs were treated with DMSO or etomoxir (40 mM) for 3 days and counted every day. (I and J) Single myofibers were isolated from WT mice and cultured in medium containing D-FCS supplemented with BSA, C8:0 (100 mM), or C18:1 (100 mM) for 3 days, followed by immunostaining and quantification (n = 24 for BSA-treated group; n = 26 for C8-treated group; n = 26 for C18-treated group). (K) Primary MuSCs were isolated from WT mice and cultured in medium containing D-FCS supplemented with BSA, C8:0 (100 mM), or C18:1 (100 mM) for 3 days. For (E), (H), and (K), each value represents mean \u00b1 SEM obtained from 3 samples. See also Figure S2. (legend continued on next page) cells. When FYN-Y531F was introduced into the cells, it slightly increased cell growth on day 4 (Figure 3J). However, when both octanoate and FYN-Y531F were present, the growth of CD36 knockdown C2C12 cells was dramatically increased (Figure 3J). Similarly, although SYK-Y131E itself did not accelerate cell growth, a further treatment with octanoate significantly increased cell growth (Figure 3K). Thus, both functions of FAs are required to promote MuSC proliferation.\n**Palmitoylation of STX11 facilitates the translocation of CD36 from cytosol to the the PM in activated MuSCs**\nWe next asked how the context-specific regulation of CD36 was achieved in muscle regeneration. As cell surface localization is required for binding of CD36 to extracellular FAs, we isolated primary MuSCs from Pax7 GFP mice and examined total and surface levels of CD36 on days 0, 3.5, 5.5., and 7 after muscle injury. The total expression level of CD36 in MuSCs did not show much difference before and after muscle injury (Figure 4A). However, the surface content of CD36 significantly increased after injury, with about 40% of the MuSCs showing surface CD36 localization on days 3.5 and 5.5 (Figure 4B). These results suggest that CD36 is translocated to the PM after muscle injury.\nTo further validate the results, we examined the subcellular localization of CD36 in C2C12 cells by immunostaining. CD36 was primarily localized in the cytosol under basal conditions but translocated to the PM when cells were treated with IGF1 (Figure 4C), a growth factor that is released by damaged muscle to promote muscle regeneration. [28][29][30][31][32] Surface biotinylation analysis further confirmed the results (Figure S4A).\nIn adipocytes, PM localization of CD36 depends on its palmitoylation. 10 We therefore hypothesized that the cytosolic localization of CD36 in C2C12 cells might be due to depalmitoylation or lack of palmitoylation. Indeed, palmostatin B (Palm B), an inhibitor of the depalmitoylases, 33,34 increased PM localization of CD36 in C2C12 cells (Figures 4C andS4A). However, the palmitoylation of either CD36 or its palmitoylating enzyme DHHC5 did not show much difference before and after IGF1 or Palm B treatment (Figure 4D), suggesting that PM translocation of CD36 does not rely on palmitoylation of itself, but some other protein(s).\nTo search for the protein(s), we treated C2C12 cells with IGF1, isolated palmitoylated proteins, and performed silver staining. A band around 35 kD caught our attention, as it was enriched in IGF1-treated cells (Figure 4E). Mass spectrometry analysis identified this protein as STX11, a palmitoylated SNARE protein (Figure 4F). 35 Indeed, STX11 was dynamically palmitoylated by IGF1 treatment, peaking at 15 min (Figure 4G).\nWe then generated a Stx11 \u00c0/\u00c0 C2C12 cell line (Figure S4B) and found that IGF1 failed to induce PM translocation of CD36 in the knockout cells (Figure 4H). Consistently, knocking out Stx11 blocked IGF1-induced FA uptake (Figures 4I andS4C) and inhibited cell growth (Figure S4D).\nTo investigate the effect of palmitoylation on STX11, we mutated all 6 palmitoylation sites of STX11 from Cys to Ser and generated a non-palmitoylated mutant (6CS) (Figure S4E). When re-introduced into Stx11 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells, the 6CS mutant could not restore IGF1-induced translocation of CD36 to the PM (Figure 4I) or FA uptake (Figure S4F).\nTo further consolidate the results, we generated knockin mice that express the non-palmitoylated form of STX11 (Stx11-KI) (Figure S4G). In WT primary MuSCs, palmitoylation of STX11 dramatically increased on day 3.5 (Figure S4H); however, in Stx11-KI MuSCs, STX11 remained unpalmitoylated before and after injury. In either MuSCs, palmitoylation of CD36 did not change before and after injury. Surface localization of CD36 was significantly increased after injury in WT MuSCs, but it was dramatically abolished in Stx11-KI myoblasts (Figure 4J). Consistently, injury-induced FA uptake was dramatically lower in Stx11-KI MuSCs (Figure 4K), and the Stx11-KI myoblasts and MuSCs growth significantly slower (Figures 4L, S4J, andS4K).\nWhen subjected to muscle injury, Stx11-KI mice showed a significant delay in muscle regeneration (Figures 4M,4N, and S4M-S4O). As a control, mutations of STX11 did not affect damage-induced increase in plasma level of FAs but blocked accumulation of muscle triglyceride (Figure S4P).\nTaken together, palmitoylation of STX11 facilitates MuSC proliferation and muscle regeneration by stimulating injury-induced PM translocation of CD36.\n**Palmitoylation facilitates fusion between CD36-and STX11-containing vesicles**\nWe next sought to explore how palmitoylated STX11 promoted PM translocation of CD36. We first examined the subcellular localization of STX11 and CD36. Under basal conditions, STX11 and CD36 were localized on different vesicles (Figure 5A). CD36 was co-localized with Rab11A, the endosome recycling compartment marker (Figure S5B). At 5 min after IGF1 treatment, these two vesicles started to fuse. At 15 min, CD36 started to show PM localization. By 30 min, the majority of CD36 was sorted to the PM (Figures 5A andS5A).\nTo characterize the two vesicles and explore how they were fused, we isolated CD36-or STX11-containing vesicles (Figure 5B).\n(C and D) Single myofibers were isolated from WT and Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and cultured in FCS-containing medium for 3 days, followed by immunostaining and quantification (n = 14 for WT; n = 12 for Cd36 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice). (E and F) Single myofibers were isolated from WT mice, cultured in FCS-containing medium, and treated with PP2 (15 mM), piceatannol (40 mM), or SP600125 (20 mM). On day 3, myofibers were harvested for immunostaining and quantification (n = 49 for DMSO-treated group; n = 47 for PP2-treated group; n = 42 for piceatannol-treated group; n = 49 for SP600125-treated group). (G and H) WT mice were subjected to muscle injury and treated with a daily gavage of vehicle (0.5% methyl cellulose), SP600125 (20 mg/kg), or entospletinib (10 mg/kg). Soleus was dissected at indicated time for immunostaining and quantification. (I) Control and CD36 knockdown C2C12 cells were set up, treated with oleate (100 mM) for indicated time, and harvested for detection of the phosphorylation of SYK and JNK. FYN was immunoprecipitated and blotted with anti-pY antibody. (J and K) On day 0, control and C2C12 stabling expressing FYN-S531F (J) or SYK-Y131E (K) were set up at 2 3 10 3 cells per well in a 12-well plate. From days 1 to 3, cells were harvested and counted each day after BSA or C8:0 (100 mM) treatment. Each value represents the mean \u00b1 SEM of a triplicate. (L) A working model showing that FAs function both as fuels and signal molecules to promote MuSC proliferation. See also Figure S3.\nMass spectrometry analysis revealed that the SNARE proteins VAMP4 and SNAP23 were on CD36-and STX11-containing vesicles, respectively (Table S3), which was confirmed by immunostaining (Figures 5C and5D). Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that VAMP4, STX11, and SNAP23 formed a complex (Figure S5C). Furthermore, knockdown of either VAMP4 or SNAP23 abolished IGF1-induced fusion of the vesicles and the subsequent PM translocation of CD36 (Figure 5E). Consistently, knocking down either of them inhibited growth of C2C12 cells (Figures 5F,  5G, S5D, andS5E). These results indicate that STX11 forms a SNARE complex with VAMP4 and SNAP23 to facilitate vesicle fusion and PM translocation of CD36.\nWe next investigated the role of palmitoylation in regulating the function of STX11. We first performed immunostaining and found that the 6CS mutant was still localized on the same vesicles with SNAP23 (Figure S5F). We then examined the effect of palmitoylation on the conformation of STX11 by performing a trypsin digestion analysis. Compared with WT STX11, the 6CS mutant was relatively resistant to trypsin digestion and showed different digestion patterns (Figures 5H andS5G), suggesting that palmitoylation regulates the conformation of STX11.\nTo further verify the results, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis by fusing mCherry and EGFP at the N and C terminus of STX11, respectively (Figure 5I). In the WT version of the fusion protein, IGF1 treatment caused a dramatic decrease in the FRET efficiency (Figure 5J), indicating the separation of the N and C terminus. By contrast, in the 6CS mutant of the fusion protein, the FRET efficiency remained high before and after IGF1 treatment (Figure 5J).\nWe moved on to study the effect of palmitoylation of STX11 on the formation of the SNARE complex. We noticed that SNAP23 is a palmitoylated protein (Figure S5H). 36 Similar to STX11, SNAP23 showed a dynamic palmitoylation after IGF1 treatment (Figure S5I). We fused EGFP and mCherry at the C terminus of STX11 and SNAP23, respectively, and perform FRET (Figure 5K). When the WT version of the two proteins was subjected to the assay, IGF1 treatment increased FRET efficiency. However, when the non-palmitoylated mutants of the two proteins were used, the effect of IGF1 was abolished (Figures 5L andS5J). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that lack of palmitoylation in either STX11 or SNAP23 largely decreased their interaction (Figure S5K).\nTaken together, these results indicate that palmitoylation of STX11 releases the locked conformation of STX11, thereby facilitating the formation of the STX11/SNAP23/VAMP4 complex and the subsequent fusion of CD36-and STX11-containing vesicles (Figure 5M).\n**DHHC20 palmitoylates STX11 to promote MuSC proliferation and muscle regeneration**\nTo further verify the results, we sought to identify the palmitoylating enzyme of STX11. We went through the mass spectrometry data and identified that DHHC20 was on the STX11-containing vesicles (Table S3) and confirmed the results by immunostaining (Figure 6A). Overexpressing DHHC20 increased palmitoylation of STX11 (Figure 6B), and knockdown of DHHC20 largely abolished palmitoylation of STX11 under either basal or IGF1-treated condition (Figure 6C). Furthermore, knockdown of DHHC20 blocked IGF1-induced PM translocation of CD36 (Figure 6D) and FA uptake (Figure 6E) and significantly inhibited cell growth (Figure S6B). These results indicate that DHHC20 is the palmitoylating enzyme of STX11.\nWe then generated Dhhc20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Figures S6C andS6D). As expected, knockout of Dhhc20 abolished palmitoylation of STX11 before and after muscle injury (Figure S6E). Furthermore, injury-induced PM translocation of CD36 was dramatically inhibited in Dhhc20 \u00c0/\u00c0 MuSCs (Figure 6F). Consistently, knockout of Dhhc20 inhibited injury-induced FA uptake (Figure S6G) and MuSC proliferation (Figures 6G-6I).\nWhen subjected to muscle injury, Dhhc20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice showed delayed muscle regeneration with decreased muscle triglyceride accumulation on day 3.5 (Figures 6J,6K, and S6H-S6L). These results indicate that DHHC20 palmitoylates STX11 to promote MuSC proliferation and muscle regeneration.\n**Inactivation of the depalmitoylase ABHD17A promotes muscle regeneration**\nWe next asked whether the dynamic palmitoylation of STX11 was due to dynamic activation of DHHC20. Palmitoylation of DHHCs is frequently used to evaluate the activity, as DHHCs tend to form self-palmitoylated intermediates. 37 However,  (A andB) Primary MuSCs were isolated from Pax7 GFP mice muscle using flow cytometry at different time points after muscle injury. One part of the cells was permeabilized and stained with anti-CD36 to evaluate total CD36 expression level (A), and the other part was directly stained with anti-CD36 antibody to evaluate surface content of CD36 (B). Each value represents mean \u00b1 SEM obtained from 3 samples. (C and D) C2C12 cells expressing CD36-mCherry and EXOC70-GFP were pretreated in serum-free medium overnight, then treated with IGF1 (30 ng/mL) for 1 h or Palm B (20 mM) for 12 h, and harvested for immunostaining (C) or acyl-resin-assisted capture (acyl-RAC) assay (D). (E) C2C12 cells were pretreated in serum-free medium overnight and then treated with IGF1 (30 ng/mL) for 1 h. Palmitoylated proteins were isolated from membrane fractions and subjected to silver staining and mass spectrometry analysis. (F) The upper panel shows a schematic illustration of the domain structure and palmitoylation sites of STX11. (G) C2C12 cells stably expressing STX11-FLAG were set up and pre-treated with serum-free medium as in (C). On day 3, cells were treated with 30 ng/mL IGF1 for indicated time and harvested for the acyl-RAC assay. (H and I) WT and Stx11 \u00c0/\u00c0 C2C12 cells were set up, transfected with indicated plasmids, and subjected to immunostaining as in (C). (J) Primary MuSCs were isolated from WT and Stx11-KI mice muscle on days 0 and 3.5 after injury and stained with anti-CD36 antibody to analyze surface content of CD36. (K) Single myofibers were isolated in WT and Stx11-KI mice on day 0, 5.5 after injury, and subjected to BODIPY staining. (L) Single myofibers were isolated in WT and Stx11-KI mice, cultured for 3 days, and subjected to immunostaining. (M and N) WT and Stx11-KI mice (8 week old, male, n = 3) were subjected to muscle injury and quantification of myofibers as in Figures 1H and1I. See also Figure S4. (legend continued on next page) palmitoylation of DHHC20 did not change before and after IGF1 treatment (Figure S6M), suggesting that the activity of DHHC20 might not be regulated by injury.\nWe then hypothesized that the dynamic palmitoylation of STX11 might be due to dynamic inactivation of the depalmitoylase, especially considering inhibiting depalmitoylation by PalmB stimulated PM translocation of CD36 (Figures 4A and4B). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that ABHD17A, a depalmitoylase, was on the STX11-containing vesicles (Table S3), which was confirmed by immunostaining (Figure 7A). Knocking down ABHD17A dramatically increased palmitoylation of STX11 in control cells (\u00c0IGF1), to a similar level of that in IGF1-treated cells (Figure 7B). Consistently, knockdown of ABHD17A promoted CD36 translocation to the PM even without IGF1 treatment (Figures 7C andS7A). These results indicate that ABHD17A is the depalmitoylase of STX11.\nTo explore whether the activity of ABHD17A is regulated, we set up an in vitro enzymatic assay system (Figure 7D). Although ABHD17A purified from control cells (\u00c0IGF1) efficiently depalmitoylated STX11, the enzyme from IGF1-treated cells failed to do so (Figure 7E), indicating that ABHD17A is inactivated by IGF1 treatment.\nTo investigate how the IGF1 signaling leads to the inactivation of ABHD17A, we first examined phosphorylation of ABHD17A, as IGF1 usually triggers a phosphorylation pathway. Indeed, IGF1 treatment triggered an increase in Ser phosphorylation of ABHD17A, and it was blocked by inhibiting the IGF1 downstream kinases MEK1/2 with U0126 (Figure 7F). Mass spectrometry analysis identified Ser212 as a phosphorylation site (Figure S7B), which is spatially close to the active site Ser190 (Figure 7G). We then mutated Ser212 to Asp and Ala to mimic the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated form, respectively. Although WT and S212A could efficiently depalmitoylate STX11, S212D failed to do so (Figure 7H). Furthermore, when re-introduced into Stx11 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells, S212A failed to restore IGF1induced PM translocation of CD36, but S212D promoted PM localization of CD36 even without IGF1 treatment (Figure S7C). These results indicate that phosphorylation at Ser212 inactivates ABHD17A.\nWe moved on to identify the kinase that phosphorylates ABHD17A. Treatment with U0126 blocked IGF1-induced palmitoylation of STX11 (Figure S7D), suggesting that ERK1 or ERK2, the downstream kinases of MEK1/2, might be candidates. Knockdown of ERK2, not ERK1, inhibited IGF1-induced palmitoylation of STX11 (Figure 7I) and PM translocation of CD36 (Figure 7J). This is consistent with the previous findings that ERK2 is required for myoblast proliferation. 38 Furthermore, U0126 blocked injury-induced translocation of CD36 to thr PM (Figure S7E) and significantly inhibited growth of PAX7 + myoblasts (Figures 7K and7L). When administrated to WT mice, U0126 dramatically inhibited muscle regeneration and injury-induced accumulation of muscle triglycerides (Figures 7M, 7N, S7F, and S7G).\n\n**DISCUSSION**\nEssentially all cells need FAs, but they uptake FAs under different conditions 3 ; however, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of context-dependent FA uptake. Several proteins have been reported to facilitate FA uptake. 2 Among them, CD36 gains the most attention as it directly binds FAs and has been shown to facilitate FA uptake in both mice and human. 4,5,7 CD36 is widely expressed in various types of cells, including adipocytes, myocytes, hepatocytes, and endothelia cells. 1 Currently, most of the studies on CD36 focus on the transcriptional regulation and simply link FA uptake to the expression level of CD36. It remains largely unknown about how CD36 activity is differentially regulated in different cells. We have previously shown that in adipocytes, CD36 is usually localized on PM, which requires its palmitoylation by DHHC4 and DHHC5. 10 Here, we identify a different regulatory mechanism of CD36 in MuSCs. In quiescent MuSCs, CD36 is localized in the cytosol, but it is translocated to the PM in activated MuSCs. The spatial and temporal regulation of PM localization of CD36 in MuSCs sets a good example of understanding the context-specific FA uptake in response to different physiological conditions or stimuli.\nIn adipocytes, palmitoylation of CD36 is required for its PM localization. 10 The small GTPase ARF6 plays a crucial role in sorting palmitoylated CD36 from Golgi to the PM. 39 However, in MuSCs, palmitoylation of CD36 itself is not enough to target CD36 to the PM. Instead, palmitoylation of another protein, STX11, is required for the translocation of CD36 to the PM. Palmitoylation of STX11 unlocks the closed confirmation, thereby facilitating the formation of STX11/SNAP23/VAMP4 complex and subsequent fusion of CD36-and STX11-containing vesicles. Therefore, the sorting machineries for targeting CD36 to the PM are different in adipocytes and MuSCs. It will provide more insights into the different sorting mechanisms by figuring out more components of the machineries in the future.\nWe have also identified FAs as essential nutrients for muscle regeneration, demonstrated adipose tissues and dietary lipids as the major sources of FAs, and figured out the underlying (B) C2C12 cells stably expressing CD36-HA or STX11-HA were lysed and subjected to vesicle purification and mass spectrometry analysis as in STAR Methods. (C and D) C2C12 cells were set up, transfected with indicated plasmids, and subjected to immunostaining as in Figure 4C. (E) C2C12 cells with knockdown of indicated genes were set up, transfected, treated with IGF1, and subjected to immunostaining as in Figure 4C. (F and G) Control, VAMP4 (F) or SNAP23 (G) knockdown C2C12 cells were set up, cultured, and counted as in Figure 2E. Each value represents the mean \u00b1 SEM of a triplicate.

On day 3, cells were treated with IGF1(30 ng/mL) for 30 min and subjected to FRET analysis. (M) An illustration of the role of STX11 palmitoylation on IGF1-induced fusion of CD36-and STX11-containing vesicles. See also Figure S5. (legend continued on next page) mechanism of how FAs promote MuSC proliferation. We show that dietary supplementation of lipids by acute HFD feeding dramatically accelerated muscle regeneration. Notably, chronic HFD feeding has been shown to attenuate MuSCs function. 40 It will be interesting to investigate how long-term exposure of FAs affects the functions of MuSCs. Notably, FAs have been shown to play essential role in controlling the fate and proliferation of several stem cells, 41 but the roles were mainly attributed to FA oxidation. 42 Our findings that FAs can function as signal molecules might help to explain their role in stemness maintenance.\nIn addition, the regulation of STX11 by dynamic palmitoylation makes it special from the syntaxin family. Different from the other members of the syntaxin family, STX11 does not have the transmembrane domain but has 6 palmitoylation sites at the C terminus, which were thought to be required for its membrane localization. 35,43 Here, we show that palmitoylation of STX11 releases the lock confirmation by separating its N terminus from C terminus. Such a regulation might put STX11 as a key node in context-specific vesicle fusion event. Notably, STX11 is abundantly expressed in the immune cells, 44 and lack of STX11 results in familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. 45 As immune cells are constantly exposed to changes in the microenvironment, it will be interesting to know whether and how dynamic palmitoylation of STX11 regulates the activity of the immune cells.\nIn summary, our findings have uncovered a context-specific regulatory mechanism of CD36 in response to muscle injury. CD36 is localized in the cytosol in quiescent MuSCs but translocated to the PM in activated MuSCs. The process requires the dynamic palmitoylation of STX11, which is achieved by inactivation of ABHD17A and palmitoylation by DHHC20. Meanwhile, we identify FAs, mobilized from adipose tissues or dietary fats, as essential nutrients to promote muscle regeneration. We show that FAs function not only as fuels but also as signal molecules to trigger a FYN/SYK/JNK signaling pathway. Our findings shed lights on context-specific regulation of FA uptake and nutritional regulation of muscle regeneration.\n**Limitations of the study**\nAlthough we have identified the pivotal role of FAs in muscle regeneration, we could not rule out that other nutrients might also play essential roles in the process. Besides, we show that FAs are mobilized from adipose tissues after muscle injury. We do not know how muscle injury triggers lipolysis of adipose tissues.\n**Mice**\nCd36 -/-mice 46 from Jackson laboratory were generously provided by Dr. Bin Liang from Yunnan University. Pax7-EGFP transgenic mice 24 on C57BL6 background were kindly provided by Dr. Dahai Zhu at Bio-island laboratory. Fsp27 -/-mice were generated as previously described. 22 Dhhc20 -/-mice were generated by targeting exon 3 using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique at Shanghai Model Organisms, China. Stx11-KI mice were generated by mutating all 6 palmitoylation sites to alanines at GemPharmatech (Nanjing, China). All mice used in the manuscript are male on a C57BL6 background.\nMice were housed in colony cages at 25 o C with 12-h light/12-h dark cycles, with 20-60% humidity. The dark cycle began at 7 pm. Mice were housed and maintained in the animal facility with free access to standard rodent chow and water. Male mice are used in the studies. All animal studies were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee at Fudan University.\n**Plasmids**\nMouse Cd36 was cloned in our previous studies. 10 Full length cDNAs of mouse Dhhc20, Abhd17a, Stx11, Snap23 and Vamp4 were cloned from a cDNA library prepared from C2C12 cells. These genes were cloned into pCDH-EF1-MCS-IRES-Puro (System Biosciences) with indicated tags. For knockdown, shRNAs were cloned into pLKO.1 (Addgene, 10878). SgRNA was cloned into pLenti-CRISPR (Addgene, 52961). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using commercial kits from New England Biolabs. The primers were listed in Table S4.\nCell culture C2C12, HEK293T cells were cultured in Medium A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/L glucose), supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin) at 37 o C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 .\nStx11 -/-C2C12 cells were generated using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Two sgRNAs flanking the coding regions of Stx11 were designed and cloned into pLentiCRISPR for lentivirus packaging. C2C12 cells were infected with lentivirus encoding these two sgRNAs and selected with 2 mg/ml puromycin. Cells were then seeded into 96-well plates and single clones were tested to confirm knockout of Stx11. A subclone of STX11 -/-C2C12 cells was used for the study.\n\n**METHOD DETAILS**\nIsolation of primary MuSCs PAX7 + MuSCs were isolated from the gastrocnemius muscle of Pax7 EGFP transgenic mice by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Briefly, muscles were chopped, digested with 0.1% collagenase (Sigma, C-0130) for 45 min, and filtered through 300-mm and 100-mm cell strainers. The resultant mononuclear muscle-derived cells were directly sorted with a BD Aria II Cell Sorting System, and PAX7 hi subpopulations were sorted based on intensity of EGFP expression levels. To analyze the surface content of CD36, we first incubated cells with monoclonal antibody 2.4G2 to block Fcg receptors, and then incubated with the anti-CD36 antibodies (1:400, BD Biosciences, 562744) in PBS containing 2% bovine serum on ice for 30 min. To analyze total levels of CD36, cells were processed for intracellular staining using CytoFix/CytoPerm Buffer Kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed with Fortessa (BD Biosciences).\n**Lentivirus production and infection**\nFor lentivirus packaging, indicated genes on pCDH-puro, shRNA on pLKO.1 or sgRNA on pLentiCRISPR was co-transfected with psPAX2 and pMD2.G into HEK293T cells as described. 10 For infection, cells were infected at 30% confluence with lentivirus in medium containing 10 mg/ml polybrene. Cells were selected against 2 mg/ml (C2C12) puromycin for at least 48 h before use for the described experiments.\n**Immunofluorescence**\nImmunofluorescence was performed as previously described. 10,39 Images were taken using a Zeiss LSM880 confocal microscopy. Co-localization analysis was performed using ZEN2.3 software. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Flag (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich, F3165), anti-HA (1:200, Roche, 11867423001), and anti-PAX7(1:10, DSHB, #PAX7). The secondary antibodies were Donkey anti-Mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21202), Goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21236), Goat anti-Rat IgG Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11007), Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A31573), and Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor Plus 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A21429), Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (1:80, Abclonal Technology, RM02835) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis EGFP (donor) and mCherry (acceptor) are the pair for the FRET analysis. To check the intramolecular confirmation of STX11, mCherry and EGFP were fused at the N-and C-terminus, respectively. To examine the interaction of STX11 and SNAP23, EGFP and mCherry were fused at the C-terminus of STX11 and SNAP23, respectively. On day 0, C2C12 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. On day 2, cells were treated with or without IGF1 (30 ng/ml) for 30 min. Imaging and photobleaching of mCherry were performed and analyzed on a Zeiss LSM-880 microscopy.\n\n\nHighlights d Fatty acids from adipose tissues and dietary fat promote muscle regeneration d Fatty acids function as both fuels and growth signals to promote MuSC proliferation d Injury-induced translocation of CD36 to the PM facilitates fatty acid uptake in MuSCs\n\n",
