    "abstract": "The cases were a pair of siblings with a carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT2) deficiency detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Their C16 and C18:1 levels were both within the normal range, while C0 was low, and the (C16+C18:1)/C2 ratio was high. Following genetic testing, a novel CPT2 gene mutation was identified in both patients. The male patient had a normal growth rate during 5 years of follow-up after treatment. By contrast, the female patient did not take l-carnitine supplements and died after an infectious disease-associated illness when she was 1 year old. These data emphasize the need to raise awareness about CPT2 deficiency so as to correctly diagnose and accurately manage the disease.\n"
