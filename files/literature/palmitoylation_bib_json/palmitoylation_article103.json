    "abstract": "S-acylation is a covalent post-translational modification of proteins with fatty acids, achieved by enzymatic attachment via a labile thioester bond. This modification allows for dynamic control of protein properties and functions in association with cell membranes. This lipid modification regulates a substantial portion of the human proteome and plays an increasingly recognized role throughout the lifespan of affected proteins. Recent technical advancements have propelled the S-acylation field into a 'molecular era', unveiling new insights into its mechanistic intricacies and far-reaching implications. With a striking increase in the number of studies on this modification, new concepts are indeed emerging on the roles of S-acylation in specific cell biology processes and features. After a brief overview of the enzymes involved in S-acylation, this viewpoint focuses on the importance of S-acylation in the homeostasis, function, and coordination of integral membrane proteins. In particular, we put forward the hypotheses that S-acylation is a gatekeeper of membrane protein folding and turnover and a regulator of the formation and dynamics of membrane contact sites.\n"
