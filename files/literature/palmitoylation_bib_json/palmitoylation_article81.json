    "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a naturally occurring, toxic environmental metal found in foods. Humans do not have an efficient mechanism for Cd elimination; thus, Cd burden in humans increases with age. Cell and mouse studies show that Cd burden from low environmental levels of exposure impacts lung cell metabolism, proliferation signaling and cell growth as part of disease-promoting profibrotic responses in the lungs. Prior integrative analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics identified the zDHHC11 transcript as a central functional hub in response to Cd dose. zDHHC11 encodes a protein S-palmitoyltransferase, but no evidence is available for effects of Cd on protein S-palmitoylation. In the present research, we studied palmitoylation changes in response to Cd and found increased protein S-palmitoylation in human lung fibroblasts that was inhibited by 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), an irreversible palmitoyltransferase inhibitor. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics showed palmitoylation of proteins involved in divalent metal transport and in fibrotic signaling. Mechanistic studies showed that 2-BP inhibited palmitoylation of divalent metal ion transporter ZIP14 and also inhibited cellular Cd uptake. Transcription analyses showed that Cd stimulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and beta3 expression within 8 h and lung fibrotic markers alpha-smooth muscle actin, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and collagen 1alpha1 gene expression and that these effects were blocked by 2-BP. Because 2-BP also blocked palmitoylation of proteins controlled by TGFbeta1, these results show that palmitoylation impacts Cd-dependent fibrotic signaling both by enhancing cellular Cd accumulation and by supporting post-translational processing of TGFbeta1-dependent proteins.\n",

    "fullText": "**Introduction**\nCadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal associated with a number of health problems, including lung fibrosis (Snider et al., 1988;Lin et al., 1998;Hu et al., 2017). Lung damage and fibrotic changes from prolonged, high levels of exposures in occupational settings have been largely controlled by improved industrial hygiene (Snider et al., 1988) (Sakurai et al., 1982;Lin et al., 1998;Jakubowski et al., 2004). With additional decline in exposures from tobacco use, drinking water and diet now represent the most important population level Cd exposures (Satarug et al., 2003). Even dietary Cd intake alone can result in meaningful deposition of Cd from circulation into the lungs (Adams et al., 2014;Smith et al., 2023).\nMultiple mechanisms contribute to Cd-mediated fibrosis; among these, activation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) by oxidative stress and inflammation appears to be especially important (Jung et al., 2022) (Lag et al., 2002;Kiran Kumar et al., 2016). Cd causes oxidative stress by inhibition of antioxidant selenoproteins (Hu et al., 2018;Smith et al., 2023). The effects of low-level Cd exposure on oxidative stress, lung inflammation and fibrosis have been established in studies of human cells and mouse models (Go et al., 2013a;Go et al., 2013b;Hu et al., 2017). Oxidative stress from low-level Cd causes oxidation of thiol/disulfide systems and disrupts actin-cytoskeleton regulation. Cd also triggers nuclear translocation of thioredoxin-1, an important protein involved in cellular redox regulation (Ahsan et al., 2009) and causes inflammation by increasing NF-\u03baB activity and proinflammatory cytokines (Jiao et al., 2019). Furthermore, activation of these processes by Cd exposure leads to increased stress fibers and myofibroblast differentiation markers, including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and extradomain-A-containing fibronectin (ED-A-FN), characteristic of fibrosis (Hu et al., 2017).\nIn our earlier study investigating low dose Cd-induced lung disease and interaction of Cd with critical cellular metals such as selenium (Se), we performed in vivo mouse experiment by exposing mice to Cd with or without supplemental Se. The lungs isolated from these mice were analyzed for the interactive effects of Cd and Se on the genes and metabolites using RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomics and highresolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, respectively (Hu et al., 2017;Hu et al., 2018). A network analysis was used to identify central transcriptome-metabolome interactions by comparing results from mice exposed to Cd, Se or Cd plus Se. Unexpectedly, the zDHHC11 transcript, not previously associated with Cd or fibrosis signaling, had high centrality associated with Cd, which was lost with co-exposure to Se (Hu et al., 2017;Hu et al., 2018). zDHHC11 is one of >20 zDHHC palmitoyltransferase family enzymes that transfer palmitate onto specific cysteine residues in proteins. Palmitoylation alters the properties of the protein, leading to changes in its localization, stability, and activity (Kummel et al., 2006;Milde and Coleman, 2014;Kaur et al., 2016;Chen et al., 2020). The zDHHC family members are expressed in various tissues and cell types and are involved in a range of cellular processes, including signal transduction, synaptic function, and protein trafficking, essential for the proper functioning of cell signaling, neurotransmitter release, and immune response (Sobocinska et al., 2017;Zmuda and Chamberlain, 2020;Guns et al., 2022). The function of S-palmitoylation in immune response is of special interest because activation by Cd could amplify TGF-\u03b2 fibrotic signaling and help explain the severity of lung responses to Cd.\nHere in, we examined for a role of protein S-palmitoylation in Cddependent fibrotic signaling by measuring changes in protein S-palmitoylation in human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HFL1) treated with Cd. We used an irreversible palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate (BP), to test for inhibition of Cd-enhanced palmitoylation, and used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify proteins undergoing Spalmitoylation in response to Cd. Results showed palmitoylation of several proteins under control of TGF-\u03b2, in addition to proteins functioning in metal transport. Inhibition of palmitoylation by 2-BP decreased cellular uptake of Cd and decreased Cd-induced activation of TGF-\u03b2. The results show that in addition to oxidative stress, protein Spalmitoylation is an important ancillary mechanism to potentiate Cd toxicity in the lungs.\n\n**Materials and methods**\n**Materials**\nF-12 K media was purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC;Rockville, Maryland). Indium standard was purchased from RICCA Chemical Company (Arlington, TX), and Cd standard was purchased from Ultra Scientific (North Kingstown, RI). Primers listed in Supplemental Table 1 were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and EZ-Link HPDP-Biotin. NeutrAvidin\u2122 Agarose were purchased from (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). All other materials were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).\n**HFL1 and A549 cell cultures, and cell treatments**\nHuman lung fibroblasts (HFL1, CCL-153; passages3 to 9; a normal fetal cell line) and human lung epithelial cancer cell (A549, CCL-185; passages 5 to 10), were purchased from ATCC. HFL1 and A549 cells were cultured in F-12 K media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Once cells reached 70% confluency, 2-BP (5 \u03bcM unless stated otherwise) treatments occurred 1 h prior to 24 h-long Cd treatments. To target protein S-palmitoylation globally, rather than specific protein targets, 2-BP was used as a nonspecific inhibitor of palmitoyltransferases. In this study, we used different Cd doses, 1 \u03bcM or 2 \u03bcM CdCl 2 . Although treatments were CdCl 2 , for simplification, \"Cd\" is stated instead of \"CdCl 2 \" throughout the present report. CdCl 2 fully dissociates at these concentrations, and \u03bcM CdCl 2 will result in 1 \u03bcM Cd +2 ion (0.112 mg Cd/L; 112 ppb Cd) in aqueous solution while 2 \u03bcM CdCl 2 will result in 2 \u03bcM Cd +2 ion (0.225 mg Cd/L; 225 ppb Cd). In experiments investigating 2-BP treatment, \u03bcM Cd was used.\nBecause 5 \u03bcM 2-BP inhibited Cd uptake by about 50%, some experiments without 2-BP used 1 \u03bcM Cd so that cellular Cd level [measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), see below] was similar to that observed with 2 \u03bcM Cd plus 5 \u03bcM 2-BP. Both Cd treatment levels used are low-dose exposures well below amounts needed to impact cell survival within the investigated timeframe (Sauvageau and Jumarie, 2013) (Jung et al., 2022). All treatments and treatment controls were performed with low serum media (0.5% FBS, 100 U/ml P/S in F-12 K) to limit low-dose Cd binding by albumin. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 \u2022 C and at 5% CO 2 .\n**Cd measurement**\nHFL1 cells were plated on 10 cm culture dishes and pretreated with a range of 2-BP concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 10 \u03bcM) for 1 h, and all were followed by 2 \u03bcM Cd for 24 h. In an additional experiment, cells were treated with 1 and 2 \u03bcM Cd for 48 h, and a subset of 2 \u03bcM Cd treated cells were pre-treated with 5 \u03bcM 2-BP for 1 h. Vehicle controls were also performed. The cells were harvested for Cd measurements by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as previously described (Hu et al., 2019). Briefly, cells were washed in PBS and collected in reverse osmosis water. Cell lysates were digested by wet acid digestion using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide in a MARS 6 microwave digestion system (CEM, Matthews, NC), with 115 In added as an internal standard. 114 Cd was measured by Thermo Scientific iCAP Q ICP-MS in collision cell mode using kinetic energy discrimination, and intensities were quantitated against a Cd standard curve. Helium was used as the collision gas. Samples were randomized for analysis and analyzed alongside two reference urine samples (NIST SRM 2668 levels 1 and 2). Cell Cd levels were normalized against protein concentrations measured by the BCA assay (Pierce Biotech, Waltham, MA).\n**Palmitoylation assay**\nThe assay was carried out by the method of Brigidi and Bamji with minor modification (Brigidi and Bamji, 2013). HFL1 cells were treated with 2 \u03bcM Cd and/or 5 \u03bcM 2-BP for 24 h and washed with ice-cold PBS two times. Total proteins were extracted with cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2% SDS, 1% NP-40, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340) and 50 mM Nethylmaleimide to block the free thiols of proteins for 2 h at room temperature (RT). The protein-S-palmitates were cleaved by 0.75 M hydroxylamine for 1 h at RT and then the free thiol groups were labeled with 5 \u03bcM of EZ-Link\u2122 HPDP-Biotin (Pierce Biotech) for 1 h at RT and separated by SDS-PAGE. The biotinylated proteins were separated by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, transferred into a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and detected with IRDye\u00ae 800CW Streptavidin (1:1,000 dilution; LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE). For comparison, we also used goat anti-biotin-HRP (1:3,000 dilution, Sigma) with chemiluminescent SuperSignal West Pico PLUS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to detect biotinylated proteins. To purify biotinylated proteins, proteins were pulled down with NeutrAvidin agarose beads (Pierce Biotech) overnight at 4 \u2022 C and then washed with PBS/0.1% SDS 4 times. A portion of each biotinylated protein sample was released with reducing SDS loading buffer (containing 10 mM DTT), separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with silver staining protocol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The remaining portion was used for LC/MS/MS analysis, described below.\n**Palmitoylome analysis by LC/MS/MS**\nFor the on-bead digestion process, we followed a previously published protocol (Soucek et al., 2016). The digestion buffer (50 mM NH 4 HCO 3 ) was added to the bead, treated with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) at RT for 30 min, and followed by 5 mM iodoacetimide (IAA) at RT for 30 min in the dark. Proteins were digested with 2 \u03bcg of lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Chemical, Richmond, VA) at RT overnight and were further digested overnight with the addition of 2 \u03bcg trypsin (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) at RT. Resulting peptides were desalted with HLB column (Waters, Milford, MA) and were dried under vacuum.\nThe data acquisition by LC-MS/MS was adapted from a published procedure (Seyfried et al., 2017). Derived peptides were resuspended in the loading buffer (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, TFA) and were separated on a Water's Charged Surface Hybrid (CSH) column (150 \u03bcm internal diameter (ID) x 15 cm; particle size: 1.7 \u03bcm). The samples were run on an EVOSEP liquid chromatography system using the 15 samples per day preset gradient and were monitored on a Q-Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer cycle was programmed to collect one full MS scan followed by 20 data dependent MS/MS scans. The MS scans (400-1600 m/z range, 3 \u00d7 10 6 AGC target, 100 ms maximum ion time) were collected at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200 in profile mode. The HCD MS/MS spectra (1.6 m/z isolation width, 28% collision energy, 1 \u00d7 10 5 AGC target, 100 ms maximum ion time) were acquired at a resolution of 17,500 at m/z 200. Dynamic exclusion was set to exclude previously sequenced precursor ions for 30 s. Precursor ions with +1, and + 7, +8 or higher charge states were excluded from sequencing.\nLabel-free quantification analysis was adapted from a published procedure (Seyfried et al., 2017). Spectra were searched using the search engine Andromeda, integrated into MaxQuant, against 2020 human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (20,379 target sequences). Methionine oxidation (+15.9949 Da), asparagine and glutamine deamidation (+0.9840 Da), and protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.0106 Da) were variable modifications (up to 5 allowed per peptide); cysteine was assigned as a fixed carbamidomethyl modification (+57.0215 Da). Only fully tryptic peptides were considered with up to 2 missed cleavages in the database search. A precursor mass tolerance of \u00b120 ppm was applied prior to mass accuracy calibration and \u00b1 4.5 ppm after internal MaxQuant calibration. Other search settings included a maximum peptide mass of 6,000 Da, a minimum peptide length of 6 residues, 0.05 Da tolerance for orbitrap and 0.6 Da tolerance for ion trap MS/MS scans. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide spectral matches, proteins, and site decoy fraction were all set to 1%. Quantification settings were as follows: re-quantify with a second peak finding attempt after protein identification has completed; match MS1 peaks between runs; a 0.7 min retention time match window was used after an alignment function was found with a 20-min RT search space. Quantitation of proteins was performed using summed peptide intensities given by MaxQuant. The quantitation method only considered razor plus unique peptides for protein level quantitation.\n**RT-PCR**\nHFL1 cells were treated as described above, and total RNA were extracted by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). cDNA was synthesized by using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) by manufacture's direction. The qRT-PCR was performed on a CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) with iQ\u2122 Supermix reagent (Bio-Rad). Primers for RT-PCR can be found in Supplemental Table 1. All the gene expression levels were normalized against GAPDH expression, and relative levels of gene expressions were quantified by 2 -\u0394\u0394CT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).\n**Statistical analyses**\nBasic statistical analyses were carried out with GraphPad Prism v9.\n\n**Results**\n**Cd-induced protein S-palmitoylation**\nWith knowledge that Cd exposure induced palmitoyltransferase zDHHC11 gene expression in mice (Hu et al., 2017;Hu et al., 2018), we used an acyl-biotin switch method to investigate the effect of Cd exposure on protein S-palmitoylation in HFL1 cells. Pilot studies with 2-BP established the acyl-biotin switch assay and dose-dependent inhibition of S-palmitoylation by 2-BP (Suppl. Fig. 1). While inhibition of total protein palmitoylation was observed with 1 \u03bcM 2-BP, a consistent increase in inhibitory effect was observed with up to 100 \u03bcM 2-BP. To ensure a pronounced effect on total protein S-palmitoylation while limiting any 2-BP toxicity, 5 \u03bcM 2-BP was used in the following experiments of this study. Cd treatment (2 \u03bcM) induced palmitoylation, and this was suppressed by pretreatment with 5 \u03bcM 2-BP (Fig. 1A). Notably, a 10 to 15 kD protein band displayed a strong palmitoylation signal with Cd treatment. Analysis in four independent experiments showed that the palmitoylation signal in this mass range was increased approximately 7fold by Cd exposure and decreased by pretreatment with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP (Fig. 1B). The results show that Cd increases protein S-palmitoylation in HFL1 cells and that 2-BP inhibits Cd-induced protein S-palmitoylation.\n**Mass spectrometry analysis of the Cd-dependent protein Spalmitoylome**\nTo identify proteins undergoing S-palmitoylation, we used the biotin switch with Neutravidin-agarose to pull down the S-palmitoylated proteins. This enriched fraction was then subjected to proteomic analysis using LC-MS/MS. The results provided identification of 8616 protein peptides, corresponding to 1432 distinct proteins. Within this set, 319 proteins (or 1836 peptides) were increased by Cd treatment, indicating that these proteins undergo Cd-dependent increase in palmitoylation. Pretreatment with 2-BP attenuated these increases (Supplementary Table 2), further supporting the interpretation that these proteins undergo Cd-dependent increase in palmitoylation.\nNotably, our investigation yielded enhanced palmitoylation of key players in Cd-dependent fibrosis such as the metal transporters zinc transporter 1 (ZNT1) and 14 (ZIP14), palmitoyltransferases (zDHHC5 and zDHHC18), and 36 proteins distinctly associated with pro-fibrotic attributes, including but not limited to desmoglein-1 and 2, fibrillin, fibronectin type-III, gelsolin, procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2, tetraspanin-4 & 9, and vimentin (Table 1). Among those profibrotic proteins we also identified TGF\u03b2 upstream (fibrillin-1, flotillin-2, fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5, integrin alpha-5, glypican-1, and laminin subunit beta-1) and downstream proteins (desmoplakin, gelsolin, hyaluronan synthase 2, heme oxygenase 2, procollagen-lysine 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 2, vimentin, and tetraspanin-4) were also palmitoylated in response to Cd exposure. In contrast, 8 proteins demonstrated links to anti-fibrotic characteristics (Table 1). Prior research shows that palmitoylation is important in inflammatory processes and our research showed that early life inflammation in response to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection resulted in subsequent increased lung Cd accumulation (Jarrell et al., 2022). The evidence for palmitoylation of metal ion transporters and palmitoyltransferases indicates that palmitoylation may be critical in  determining cellular Cd uptake. Thus, we next examined effect of inhibition of palmitoylation on cellular Cd uptake.\n**2-BP treatment reduced Cd uptake in HFL1 cell**\nTo test whether the inhibition of S-palmitoylation of metal transporters by 2-BP impacts Cd uptake by HFL1 cells, cells were pretreated with various concentrations of 2-BP for 1 h prior to 2 \u03bcM Cd treatment for 24 h. After treatment, the cells were collected, and the Cd levels in the cells were measured by ICP-MS. As shown in Fig. 2, pretreatment with 2-BP effectively inhibited Cd uptake in HFL1 cells, starting from a concentration of 1 \u03bcM 2-BP. Increasing the concentration of 2-BP to 5 and 10 \u03bcM did not result in further suppression of Cd uptake in HFL1 cells. To ensure that the inhibitory effect of 2-BP was maintained at 48 h with the 2 \u03bcM Cd and 5 \u03bcM 2-BP conditions investigated further, intracellular Cd levels were also observed under these conditions and compared alongside 48 h treatment with 1 \u03bcM Cd alone. Under these conditions, 2-BP also decreased Cd uptake by 40%, resulting in Cd levels approximated by 1 \u03bcM Cd treatment alone (Suppl. Fig. 2). These results\nshow that Cd-dependent stimulation of S-palmitoylation has a selfactivating characteristic for Cd toxicity, apparently involving palmitoylation of ZNT1, ZIP14 and/or zDHHC5 and zDHHC18 palmitoyltransferases.\n**TGF\u03b2 and its down-stream gene stimulation by Cd**\nOur previous studies showed stimulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling by Cd (Hu et al., 2017). The possible auto-activation mechanism suggests that a biphasic Cd activation of TGF\u03b2 signaling could occur. In this study, we observed that 5 \u03bcM 2-BP reduces Cd uptake by half (Fig. 2). In order to study the effect of Cd on pro-fibrotic gene expression in isolation from 2-BP effects on Cd uptake, we examined the temporal effects of 1 \u03bcM Cd stimulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling and stimulation of target gene expression.\nCells were treated with 1 \u03bcM Cd and harvested at 0, 8, 24, and 48 h for RT-PCR to measure the abundance of TGF\u03b2 signaling transcripts. As seen in Fig. 3A, TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23 were significantly induced within 8 h. The level was decreased to control level at 24 h, and there was an increasing trend at 48 h. Interestingly, TGF\u03b22 showed the opposite pattern compared to those of TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23, with a decreasing trend at 8 h and 48 h and an intermediate increasing trend at 24 h. One of the most established fibrotic markers, \u03b1SMA, was significantly induced within 8 h, held this trend to 24 h and fell to the 0 h level at 48 h (Fig. 3B). Other well-known fibrosis development markers, MMP2 and collagen 1\u03b11, show similar patterns as those of TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23, with significant induction at 48 h. Another marker, fibronectin (Li et al., 2022), did not show significance even at 48 h treatment with Cd, although the trend seemed to increase at 48 h. Taken together, the temporal pattern of Cd activation of TGF\u03b2 signaling, which is known to involve oxidative stress, and enhancement of protein S-palmitoylation by Cd suggest that protein S-palmitoylation is linked to TGF\u03b2 signaling.\n**2-BP suppressed stimulation of TGF\u03b2 target genes and fibrotic marker genes by Cd**\nTo further investigate the role of palmitoylation in expression of TGF\u03b2 target genes, we pretreated HFL1 cells for 1 h with or without 5 \u03bcM 2-BP followed by treatment with 2 \u03bcM Cd for 48 h, and then extracted total RNA for RT-PCR. As seen in Fig. 4, Cd-elevated mRNA levels of an early fibrotic marker \u03b1SMA (A), and late fibrotic marker genes for collagen1\u03b11 (B), fibronectin (C), and MMP (D), were suppressed by 2-BP treatment. Expression levels of TGF\u03b2 isoforms observed in this experiment are also provided in Suppl. Fig. 3. No significant effect (p < 0.05) under these conditions was observed for TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23, but a trend (p < 0.10) observed in these data resembled that observed with p < 0.05 for TGF\u03b2 downstream targets, demonstrating the effects of palmitoylation inhibition on TGF\u03b2 signaling. To test generalizability of palmitoylation, we performed this experiment with lung alveolar epithelial A549 cells and found the same pattern of fibrotic marker gene expression (Suppl. Fig. 4). Taken together, our data show that protein S-palmitoylation has an important role in Cd-dependent pro-fibrotic TGF\u03b2 signaling.\n**Contextual mapping of Cd-dependent palmitoylome**\nTo further understand these complex Cd-dependent processes, we used PANTHER (https://pantherdb.org/), a gene classification tool (Mi et al., 2019), to identify cellular distribution of proteins exhibiting Cddependent palmitoylation. Among the 317 proteins, 218 proteins were mapped to cellular anatomical entity (GO:0110165), and 60 were associated with protein-containing complex (GO:0032991). Among the 218 proteins, the most of proteins (73.9%) were associated with cell membrane (Table 2). Selected examples (Table 2) and literature searched results emphasize the potential importance of palmitoylation in cellular fibrosis. Specially, the integrin signaling generated Pathway Diagram from PANTHER Classification system (https://pantherdb.org /pathway/pathDetail.do?clsAccession=P00034) shows that palmitoylations of integrin components on plasma membrane were increased by Cd and suppressed by the addition of 2-BP (Suppl. Fig. 5). This data and TGF\u03b2 upstream (fibrillin-1, flotillin-2, fibronectin type III domaincontaining protein 5, integrin alpha-5, glypican-1, and laminin subunit beta-1) establish an important role for protein S-palmitoylation in promotion of fibrosis by low level environmental Cd exposures.\n\n**Discussion**\nThe present study provides evidence for a central role of protein Spalmitoylation in Cd-dependent lung fibrosis mechanisms. Cd is a toxic metal that can cause various health issues, including organ damage, cancer, and fibrosis. Here, we found that low-dose Cd treatment enhanced palmitoylation in HFL1 cells, which was attenuated by the palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-BP. Furthermore, transporters functioning in cellular Cd uptake were found to be S-palmitoylated, and 2-BP attenuated Cd intake in the cell. Palmitoylome analysis established a distinct correlation between the Cd-induced palmitoylome and proteins associated with fibrosis, and Cd exposure resulted in the upregulation in expression of TGF\u03b2 signaling pathways and downstream fibrotic marker genes, which were inhibited by the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP. Thus, in conjunction with known oxidative stress and inflammatory processes involved in Cd-dependent activation of lung fibrosis, protein S-palmitoylation appears to support upstream processes of cellular Cd loading as well as downstream processes of cellular and extracellular remodeling.\nAmong the most intriguing findings is the evidence for S-palmitoylation of palmitoyltransferases zDHHC5 and zDHHC18 and the metal transporters ZNT1 and ZIP14. Inhibition of cellular Cd uptake by 2-BP indicates that the S-palmitoylation of the transporters is important in transporter activity. If Cd-dependent increase in palmitoyltransferases also contributes to increased activity, then the Cd-dependent effect can be viewed as an autocatalytic activator mechanism that potentiates Cd toxicity by activating Cd uptake. Prior evidence that S-palmitoylation functions in immune system activation (Zhang et al., 2021) and our finding that RSV infection in infant mice potentiates subsequent Cd accumulation in the lungs (Jarrell et al., 2022), indicates that palmitoylation might play a role in regulating Cd toxicity after viral infection and other causes of lung infection. Palmitoylation of ZIP14 is one potential mechanism that could contribute to the decrease in Cd concentration after 2-BP treatment, but further investigation is needed to separate effects on Cd transport and efflux. Additionally, interplay of other metals that utilize ZIP14 and ZNT1, such as Cu, Zn, and Co, will need investigation to better understand the role of this apparent selfactivating mechanism in Cd toxicity and cellular defense.\nThe S-palmitoylome analysis provides valuable insights into the specific proteins that undergo palmitoylation in response to Cd exposure. Notably, our results establish a robust link between Cd-dependent S-palmitoylation of >30 proteins associated with TGF\u03b2 and fibrotic signaling pathways. This underscores a potential to be a key modulator of Cd-induced fibrotic responses by influencing the localization and activity of proteins contributing to fibrosis. In this regard, there is a possibility that cysteine residues undergoing S-palmitoylation are also involved in redox regulation by S-glutathionylation, S-nitrosylation, persulfidation or other redox mechanisms (Sies and Jones, 2020). Thus, future studies will be needed to address cross-talk between signaling mechanisms.\nOur findings in HFL1 cells are consistent with previous studies reporting that TGF\u03b2 is involved in the progression of fibrosis in various   organs (Wilson, 2021). Hu et al. (2017) showed that 2 \u03bcM Cd led to increased expression of TGF\u03b2 down-stream genes such as \u03b1SMA, Axin2, collagen 1\u03b11, and ED-A-FN in HFL1 cells, and complimentary increases in protein abundance were observed in HFL1 cells treated with 1-2 \u03bcM Cd. Similar effects were observed in lungs of mice given low-dose dietary cadmium (Hu et al., 2017). Here we showed that Cd induced TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23 in 8 h, which later decreased to the control level, and then increased again at 48 h. In contrast, TGF\u03b22 showed an opposite pattern (Fig. 3). Baroni et al. (2015), showed that TGF\u03b21 and TGF\u03b23 are downregulated while TGF\u03b22 was induced at 48 h with toxic levels (20 \u03bcM) of Cd treatment in human bronchial epithelial cells (Baroni et al., 2015). Our finding that low-dose Cd can induce oscillation patterns of TGF\u03b21, TGF\u03b22 and TGF\u03b23 through a 48 h period suggests additional complexity in TGF\u03b2 signaling in relation to Cd exposure, reflecting what occurs in vivo during tissue repair (Cho et al., 2002). Dependence of both TGF\u03b2-dependent gene expression upon S-palmitoylation and downstream involvement of S-palmitoylation in post-translational modification further highlights the need for temporal considerations in future studies of Cd-driven inflammation, palmitoylation, and fibrosis.\nA proposed scheme for S-palmitoylation function in Cd-dependent lung fibrosis based upon the present research is provided in Fig. 5. Cellular Cd uptake causes oxidative stress through binding and inhibition of antioxidant selenoenzymes (Hu et al., 2018), as well as interference with Zn-dependent processes (Brz\u00f3ska et al., 2021) and calciumdependent signaling (Adi et al., 2016). S-palmitoylation of metal ion transporters stimulates Cd uptake, and Cd potentiation of palmitoylation of palmitoyltransferases, and these transporters provide mechanisms to potentiate Cd-mediated fibrotic signaling. Cd induction of TGF\u03b2 signaling is well documented; however, the mechanism of Cd stimulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling is not known. The 2-BP data show that Cddependent activation of TGF\u03b2 signaling is dependent upon S-palmitoylation, but whether this is exclusively due to stimulated Cd uptake or other mechanisms will require further clarification. The reported palmitoylome results suggest additional involvement of 2-BP in either translocation of unmatured TGF\u03b2 to the plasma membrane with the integrin complex or maturation of TGF\u03b2 in the integrin complex. Additional studies will be needed to determine S-palmitoylation during timedependent Cd exposure and its effects on the distributions and activities of TGF\u03b2-controlled proteins.\nDespite these remaining questions, our results show that protein Spalmitoylation is a potential therapeutic target for prevention or management of Cd-dependent lung fibrosis. Additional consideration is needed for infections and other environmental, lifestyle, or health factors which lead to dysregulation of protein palmitoylation; individuals affected by these factors may carry additional risk for fibrosis or metabolic dysregulation in response to Cd exposure. Further work will be needed to explore how these factors may sensitize or desensitize an individual to Cd exposure, due to differences in Cd-influenced protein palmitoylation.\nIn summary, our study shows that protein S-palmitoylation is an important mechanism involved in Cd-dependent lung fibrosis signaling.\nThe results indicate that sensitivity to Cd is potentiated by autoactivation mechanisms by which exposure to Cd potentiates S-palmitoylation of ZIP14 and cellular Cd loading. At least 30 of the proteins under control of TGF\u03b2 undergo S-palmitoylation in response to Cd exposure, raising the possibility that in addition to upstream potentiation of profibrotic signaling, downstream post-translational modifications of TGF\u03b2-dependent proteins may enhance their fibrotic activities. While additional research is needed to improve mechanistic understanding, the results indicate that S-palmitoylation may represent a drug-able target to prevent or manage Cd-dependent lung fibrosis.\n\n\nCadmium (Cd) is a naturally occurring, toxic environmental metal found in foods. Humans do not have an efficient mechanism for Cd elimination; thus, Cd burden in humans increases with age. Cell and mouse studies show that Cd burden from low environmental levels of exposure impacts lung cell metabolism, proliferation signaling and cell growth as part of disease-promoting profibrotic responses in the lungs. Prior integrative analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics identified the zDHHC11 transcript as a central functional hub in response to Cd dose. zDHHC11 encodes a protein S-palmitoyltransferase, but no evidence is available for effects of Cd on protein S-palmitoylation. In the present research, we studied palmitoylation changes in response to Cd and found increased protein S-palmitoylation in human lung fibroblasts that was inhibited by 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), an irreversible palmitoyltransferase inhibitor. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics showed palmitoylation of proteins involved in divalent metal transport and in fibrotic signaling. Mechanistic studies showed that 2-BP inhibited palmitoylation of divalent metal ion transporter ZIP14 and also inhibited cellular Cd uptake. Transcription analyses showed that Cd stimulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and \u03b23 expression within 8 h and lung fibrotic markers \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and collagen 1\u03b11 gene expression and that these effects were blocked by 2-BP. Because 2-BP also blocked palmitoylation of proteins controlled by TGF\u03b21, these results show that palmitoylation impacts Cd-dependent fibrotic signaling both by enhancing cellular Cd accumulation and by supporting post-translational processing of TGF\u03b21-dependent proteins.\n\n",
