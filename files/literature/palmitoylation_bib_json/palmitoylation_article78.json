    "abstract": "Incomplete structural details of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) fatty acid synthase-I (FAS-I) at near-atomic resolution have limited our understanding of the shuttling mechanism of its mobile acyl carrier protein (ACP). Here, we have performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation of Mtb FAS-I with a homology-modeled structure of ACP stalled at dehydratase (DH) and identified key residues that mediate anchoring of the recognition helix of ACP near DH. The observed distance between catalytic residues of ACP and DH agrees with that reported for fungal FAS-I. Further, the conformation of the peripheral linker is found to be crucial in stabilizing ACP near DH. Correlated interdomain motion is observed between DH, enoyl reductase, and malonyl/palmitoyl transferase, consistent with prior experimental reports of fungal and Mtb FAS-I.\n"
