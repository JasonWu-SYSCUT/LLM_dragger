    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: 2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL), the primary constituent of human milk oligosaccharides, has been identified as a potential regulator of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. Despite this recognition, the specific mechanisms through which 2'-FL alleviates ulcerative colitis (UC) remain ambiguous. This study seeks to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory properties of 2'-FL concerning intestinal inflammation and uncover the associated mechanisms. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were orally administered a daily dose of 500 mg/kg 2'-FL for 11 consecutive days, followed by the induction of colitis using 3 % (wt/vol) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for the final 6 days. Subsequently, a comprehensive range of techniques, including an Acyl-biotin exchange assay, fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled dextran assay, histopathology, ELISA, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry staining, Alcian blue-periodic acid schiff staining, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, transmission electron microscopy, iTRAQ quantitative proteomics, bioinformatics analysis, and the generation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) knockout mice, were employed to explore the relevant molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: Administration of 2'-FL significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice and enhanced the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. 2'-FL downregulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 and inhibited STAT3-related signaling pathways in colon tissues, which, in turn, reduced inflammatory responses. Interestingly, knockdown of STAT3 attenuated the protective effects of 2'-FL, highlighting that 2'-FL-mediated inflammatory attenuation is dependent on STAT3 expression. Additionally, 2'-FL could influence STAT3 activation by modulating the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of STAT3.

Extensive research has provided compelling evidence supporting the crucial role of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) in the favorable effects of breast milk [2]. HMOs are composed of a repertoire of over 200 distinct oligosaccharides. Notably, within this spectrum, 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-FL) is the predominant fucosyloligosaccharide, constituting over 30 % of all HMOs. Remarkably, 2'-FL has been approved for use as a nutritional health care supplement by the US Food and Drug Administration and it is primarily utilized in infant formula at present. Notably, the physiological functionalities of 2'-FL encompass a spectrum of effects such as prebiotic activity, antiadhesive antimicrobial properties, immunomodulation, and the facilitation of brain development [3]. Currently, the predominant focus of research centers on elucidating the impact of 2'-FL on the gut microbiota. Nevertheless, it is imperative to acknowledge that 2'-FL concurrently possesses the intrinsic capability to impede the adhesion of pathogenic microorganisms and inhibit the proliferation of potentially harmful bacteria.\nInflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) comprises autoimmune disorders marked by persistent intestinal inflammation, encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). The etiology involves genetic predisposition, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, environmental triggers, and aberrations in host immune responses. Epidemiological data associating diet with IBD development has spurred considerable interest in investigating dietary interventions for prevention and treatment of IBD [4]. Previous preclinical studies have suggested that 2'-FL can ameliorate colitis by modulating gut microbiota composition, inhibiting pathogen adhesion, and promoting the restoration of intestinal barrier function [5e10]; however, the specific mucosal signaling pathways which 2'-FL could influence in colitis remain unclear.\nPrior investigations have confirmed the crucial involvement of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in diverse autoimmune diseases, including IBD [11,12]. The activation of STAT3 is mediated by various cytokines, with notable examples including IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17 [13]. Particularly, inflammatory cytokine signaling via IL-6 and STAT3 has consistently been recognized as a significant element in the context of colitis [13e15]. Furthermore, recent findings have revealed that the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of STAT3 contribute to the TH17 cell differentiation [16]. Notably, previous study suggests that 2'-FL may alleviate psoriasis induced by imiquimod by modulating the STAT3 signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of the immune response in Th17 cells [17]. However, in the study led by He et al., the application of 2'-FL to intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) resulted in an augmentation of STAT3 phosphorylation. Intriguingly, this intervention concurrently attenuated the expression of membrane CD14, consequently inhibiting the release of IL-8 elicited by type 1 pili enterotoxigenic E. coli infection [18]. This observation contradicts our prior understanding of the pro-inflammatory signaling cascade involving STAT3.\nTo thoroughly investigate the interplay between 2'-FL and the STAT3 signaling pathway in UC, we developed mice with conditional knockout of STAT3 specifically in epithelial cells of the intestinal tract. Our study aimed to assess the proposition that 2'-FL facilitates the restoration of the gut barrier and mitigates inflammatory responses in ulcerative colitis by impeding the palmitoylation and phosphorylation processes of STAT3.\n**Methods and materials**\n**Animals**\nMale C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice, aged 6e8 weeks, were obtained from the Vital River Laboratory (Beijing, China). STAT3 fl/fl mice and Villin-Cre mice were acquired from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). To generate STAT3-deficient mice in intestinal epithelial cells (STAT3 DIEC ), STAT3 fl/fl mice were bred with Villin-Cre mice. The successful deletion of intestinal epithelial STAT3 was confirmed through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis (Table S1, Fig. S1). All mice used in the experiments were kept in a specific-pathogen-free animal facility situated at the Animal Experiment Center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, granted ethical approval for the animal experiments (IACUC Issue No. 20220204). The animal experiments followed the guidelines outlined in the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals.\n**In vivo study**\n2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL) (catalog #GY1141M, HuicH, Shanghai, China) was prepared via dissolution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to usage, where a concentration of 50 mg/ml was recommended. The animals received either an equal volume of 2'-FL (500 mg/kg/day) or PBS alone through gavage administration once daily over a period of 11 consecutive days. During the final 6 days, the mice were provided drinking water containing or lacking 3 % (wt/vol) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS; #160110, molecular weight 36 to 50 kDa; MP Biomedicals, USA). Daily monitoring and calculations of body weight, stool consistency, and the presence of gross blood in the feces and anus were conducted to generate the Disease Activity Index (DAI), utilizing a scoring system ranging from 0 to 4 (Table S2). On the seventh day following DSS treatment, experimental mice were euthanized. Hematological samples were obtained via orbital puncture, with the entire colon isolated for measurement of its length. Then, the bowels were emptied of fecal contents for subsequent analysis. A small segment (1e2 mm 3 ) of the terminal colon was rapidly excised and immersed in 2.5 % glutaraldehyde for transmission electron microscopy. Simultaneously, the remaining distal colon underwent fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The residual part of the colon was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen to facilitate subsequent analyses, including quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting (WB).\n**Evaluation of intestinal barrier integrity in murine models**\nPreceding oral administration, mice were deprived of food access in the morning, 4 h prior to gavage. A fresh solution containing 80 mg/ml 4 kDa Fluorescein-Isothiocyanate-Labeled Dextran (FITCdextran, #CSN36366, CSNpharm, Shanghai, China) was prepared in sterile 1x PBS immediately before administration, ensuring protection from light. Oral gavage administration of FITC-dextran was performed at a dose of 0.8 mg/g body weight, and 1 h after gavage, in vivo fluorescence was assessed by an imaging machine (Lumina II, Caliper Life Sciences, America). Specifically, abdominal fur was removed using an electric shaver, and photographs of the abdominal area were taken with laser settings at 470 nm. Four hours postgavage, hematologic specimens were collected and the plasma was extracted in the dark. Fluorescence intensity (lex \u00bc 485/ lem \u00bc 515 nm) of the samples and standards was detected using a Victor Nivo microplate reader (PerkinElmer, USA) [19].\n**LPS stimulation in vitro**\nThe NCM460 cell line, originating from normal human colon mucosal epithelial cells, was procured from BeNa Culture Collection (Hebei, China). Authentication through short tandem repeat (STR) profiling was performed to ensure its identity. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin. Culturing was carried out at 37 C in a humidified environment with 5 % CO 2 . Cells were plated in 6-well plates and incubated for 48 h in fresh media supplemented with 2'-FL at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. After the incubation, the cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; catalog #L2880, Sigma, USA) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for 24 h. In certain experiments involving the inhibition of TRAF6, cells were co-treated with LPS and 10 mM of C25-140 (TRAF6 inhibitor; catalog #HY-120934, MedChemExpress) for a specified duration [20]. The collected supernatants were stored at \u00c020 C for subsequent analysis.\n**STAT3 knockdown vitro**\nSmall interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules specifically targeting the STAT3 gene (siSTAT3) and non-targeting siRNAs (siNC) were obtained from GenePharma (Suzhou, China). To achieve knockdown of STAT3 protein expression, NCM460 cells were transfected with siSTAT3 utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 (#11668019, Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer's guidelines. Negative control groups included cells transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 alone and cells transfected with siNC in conjunction with Lipofectamine 2000. The efficiency of STAT3 suppression was assessed 72 h after siRNA transfection through quantitative real-time PCR and WB analysis. The sequences of siSTAT3 and siNC are provided in Table S3, and the transfection efficiency is depicted in Fig. S2.\n**Mutagenesis**\nThe wild-type (WT) STAT3 gene and its mutants (Y705F and C108S) were synthesized and inserted into the pcDNA3.1(\u00fe) expression vector, which was obtained from GenePharma (Suzhou, China). Transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine 6000 (#C0526, Beyotime, China) as the transfection reagent.\n**Acylebiotin exchange assay (ABE)**\nThe samples were immersed in 1 ml lysis buffer (LB) with the addition of 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (#N808610, Macklin, China). The protein concentration was assessed through a BCA assay. Methanol, chloroform, and water (v/v 4:1:3) (CM precipitations) were used to enrich protein contents. NH 2 OH and Biotin-HPDP (#B871617, Macklin, China) were applied later. Immunoprecipitation was performed using streptavidin magnetic beads (#88816, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The magnetic beads and loading controls were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, resulting in a reduction, and then heated at 100 C for 5 min. The supernatants containing the target antigen were magnetically separated and stored at \u00c080 C for subsequent WB analysis [16,21,22].\n**Statistical analysis**\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0. The data were presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM (standard error of the mean). Student's t-test was employed for comparisons between two groups, while one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or BrowneForsythe and Welch ANOVA tests were used for other data analyses. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nDetailed methods for ABE, histopathology, ELISA, quantitative real-time PCR, WB, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry staining, Alcian blue-periodic acid schiff (AB-PAS) staining, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL), transmission electron microscopy and iTRAQ quantitative proteomics, and bioinformatics are available in the supplementary materials and methods.\n\n**Results**\n**2'-FL administration alleviates DSS-induced colitis**\nTo investigate whether and how 2'-FL exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, we conducted an experimental study utilizing a murine model of colitis induced by DSS. The experimental design and workflow are depicted in Fig. 1A. Notably, the mice administered 2'-FL exhibited attenuated colonic inflammatory responses, as evidenced by reduced weight loss, lower Disease Activity Index (DAI) scores, and longer colon lengths compared to those of the DSS group (Fig. 1B-D).\nWe subsequently assessed the impact of 2'-FL on murine colitis histopathology by performing H&E staining on the tissue samples of colon. Notably, mice treated with DSS displayed characteristic features of colitis, including mucosal erosion, crypt loss, epithelial cell sloughing, and inflammatory cell infiltration. In contrast, mice pretreated with 2'-FL exhibited a reduction in these manifestations of inflammation (Fig. 1E). Additionally, the level of inflammagenic cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1b, and IFN-g, were notably raised in the DSS groups. However, pretreatment with 2'-FL effectively inhibited the induction of these inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 1F,G). Collectively, our findings provide compelling evidence that 2'-FL exerts a remarkable ameliorative effect on colitis elicited by DSS in mice.\n**2'-FL administration promotes recovery of intestinal mucosal barrier**\nPrevious research has established that 2'-FL has the capacity to promote mucin secretion in goblet cells, indicating its potential role in maintaining the intestinal mucosal barrier [9]. To delve deeper into the influence of 2'-FL on the gut barrier, we evaluated different markers of barrier integrity in the colon tissue of mice. In the in vivo fluorescence analysis, mice with 2'-FL supplementation showed reduced hepatic and splenic FITC-dextran intake and lower abdominal cavity fluorescence compared to PBS-only mice in the colitis model (Fig. 2A), which suggested that 2'-FL pretreatment guarded against increased intestinal permeability. Mice supplemented with 2'-FL exhibited significantly lower plasma FITCdextran levels than those received the PBS alone (Fig. 2B), signifying enhanced gut barrier by restricting the permeation of FITCdextran across the gut into the bloodstream. Moreover, the number of goblet cells and mucin secretion from colonic glands were remarkably elevated upon 2'-FL supplementation (Fig. 2C). Additionally, immunohistochemistry staining showed that mice administered with 2'-FL demonstrated increased levels of ZO-1 and MUC-2 in the inflamed intestinal tissue (Fig. 2D,E). The result of immunofluorescence staining of ZO-1 was consistent with the immunohistochemistry staining results (Fig. 2F). Moreover, pretreatment with 2'-FL markedly ameliorated the ultrastructural alterations in intercellular junctions, with a pronounced effect on tight junctions, as highlighted by red asterisks in the transmission electron microscopy images of colonic tissues (Fig. 2G). Specifically, the DSS group exhibited blurry structures at the apical side of cells, whereas the DSS\u00fe2'-FL group displayed highly electron-dense structures, indicative of preserved tight junction integrity. Furthermore, 2'-FL pretreatment significantly decreased the count of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2H). As depicted in Fig. 2I, mice administered with 2'-FL showcased elevated levels of ZO-1, occludin, and Bcl-2, while concurrently displaying reduced levels of Bax compared to the DSS group. Collectively, these findings indicate that 2'-FL enhances the robustness of the intestinal barrier in mice with colitis induced by DSS.\nConsistent with these effects, treatment with 2'-FL suppressed the induction of IL-6 in NCM460 cells stimulated by LPS (Fig. 2J).  Immunofluorescence staining revealed an elevated level of ZO-1 in response to 2'-FL treatment (Fig. 2K). Furthermore, pretreatment with 2'-FL resulted in heightened expression levels of ZO-1, occludin, and Bcl-2, accompanied by a reduction in the expression of Bax in these cells (Fig. 2L). Taken together, the results suggest that the administration of 2'-FL promotes recovery of the intestinal mucosal barrier.\n**2'-FL treatment suppresses STAT3-related signaling pathways that induce inflammation**\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of STAT3 elicited by IL-6 is associated with the activation of effector lymphocytes and granulocytes in IBD [13]. By analyzing GSE59071 and GSE179285 in the GEO database, we demonstrated that STAT3 was significantly highly expressed in IBD (Fig. 3A).\nThe LPS receptor complex consists of LPS-binding protein (LBP), myeloid differentiation protein 2(MD2), CD14, and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) [23]. Notably, excessive LPS signaling can elicit systemic inflammation, and it was reported that 2'-FL can mitigate LPS-induced inflammation by reducing CD14 expression in intestinal epithelial cell models [18]. Moreover, previous investigations have demonstrated the critical involvement of TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB pathways in the etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [10]. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), functioning as both a signaling adaptor and E3 ubiquitin ligase, exerts regulatory control over the activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [24]. Subsequently, the activation of these molecules can stimulate the transcription of jun oncogene (AP-1) and induce phosphorylation of STAT3 [25]. We continued to analyze GSE59071 and GSE179285 and found that STAT3 was correlated with LBP, CD14, TLR4, and TRAF6 in colitis (Fig. 3B-E).\nTo further explore the relationship between 2'-FL and STAT3 in colitis, iTRAQ-LC-MS/MS quantitative analysis was performed. The quantitative analysis provided a comprehensive characterization of the proteome, identifying a total of 7,037 proteins within the mouse intestinal tissue (see the volcano map in Fig. 3F). Using predefined cutoff thresholds (p < 0.05 and |logFC|>1.5), 46 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, comprising 10 upregulated and 36 downregulated proteins (Fig. 3F andG). Hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted to examine the expression patterns of the DEPs between the two groups of mice, visualized in the form of a heat map (Fig. 3H). The color intensity reflects the relative protein expression level, with deeper red indicating higher expression and vice versa. Notably, KEGG enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of DEPs in various pathways, and the enriched pathways were visualized in scatter plots (Fig. 3I), which indicated that 2'-FL may mitigate colitis through STAT3-related signaling pathways, including the IL17 signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and Th17 signaling pathway. Subsequently, several pathway terms related to STAT3 were selected for network analysis (Fig. 3J).\nThese findings highlight the potential role of STAT3 in the underlying mechanism of colitis attenuation by 2'-FL.\n**2'-FL attenuates colitis by suppressing the STAT3 signaling pathway**\nEarlier investigations have established the important role of LBP in facilitating the transfer of LPS to CD14/MD2, consequently fostering the activation of TLR4 [26]. Consistent with these findings, our results indicated a higher level of serum LBP in the DSS group compared to the control group, while the DSS\u00fe2'-FL group exhibited lower LBP expression (Fig. 4A). Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining revealed a strong correlation between TRAF6 and p-STAT3 Y705 levels (Fig. 4B-D). WB analysis also showed that 2'-FL treatment led to decreased expression of TRAF6 and phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-kB (Fig. 4E).\nWe next examined the inflammatory signaling molecules in NCM460 cells. Remarkably, the changes induced by 2'-FL treatment in these molecules mirrored the outcomes observed in the in vivo experiments (Fig. 4F-H).\nIt is known that phosphorylated STAT3 undergoes nuclear translocation and induces transcription upon activation [13]. To investigate the effects of 2'-FL on the subcellular localization of STAT3, we performed nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction and analyzed their expression levels via WB. Interestingly, while the total expression of STAT3 was similar between the two groups, the level of STAT3 in the nuclear fraction was lower in the 2'-FLpretreated cells than that in the LPS-treated cells. This finding is consistent with the observed inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in cells treated with 2'-FL (Fig. 4I). Furthermore, the translocation of STAT3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was confirmed with immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 4J).\nSubsequent investigations focused on evaluating the influence of TRAF6 inhibition on cellular responses. Remarkably, we observed that the TRAF6 inhibitor effectively attenuated the LPS-induced inflammation and phosphorylation of STAT3 and NF-kB, which mirrored the favorable effects observed with 2'-FL treatment (Fig. 4K). Notably, the combination of 2'-FL and TRAF6 inhibition did not result in any additional enhancement of the aforementioned protein level changes (Fig. 4K).\nIn summary, these findings indicate that 2'-FL exerts its antiinflammatory effects by inhibiting the STAT3 signaling pathway.\n**Knockdown of STAT3 attenuates inflammatory responses and compromises the effectiveness of 2'-FL in vivo**\nTo gain deeper insights into the anti-inflammatory effects of 2'-FL in colitis and its relationship with STAT3, we employed a mouse model with targeted deletion of Stat3 in the intestinal epithelium (STAT3 DIEC ), with cre-negative littermates serving as controls (referred to as STAT3 fl/fl ). The experimental designs are depicted in Fig. 5A. Knockdown of STAT3 in the intestinal epithelium more strongly attenuated colitis manifestations compared to the control group (Fig. 5B-D), and a modest pro-inflammatory cytokine response was observed among STAT3 DIEC mice (Fig. 5F,G). Interestingly, among STAT3 DIEC mice, there were no discernible differences in inflammatory symptoms between the group pretreated with 2'-FL and the untreated group (Fig. 5B-G).\nThe colonic tissue of the STAT3 DIEC -DSS group exhibited elevated expression levels of ZO-1 and MUC2 compared to the STAT3 fl/fl -DSS group. Nevertheless, comparative analysis of protein levels between the STAT3 DIEC -DSS and STAT3 DIEC -DSS\u00fe2'-FL groups did not show any statistically significant variances (Fig. 6A,B). The levels of mucins were lowest in the STAT3 fl/fl -DSS group and were elevated in the other three groups. However, no substantial differences were observed among the three groups (Fig. 6C). The immunofluorescence staining results of ZO-1 were consistent with the immunohistochemical results (Fig. 6D). Transmission electron microscopy images indicated that in the DSS-induced colitis model, the tight junction ultrastructure was more intact in STAT3 DIEC mice than in STAT3 fl/fl mice. Treatment with 2'-FL greatly improved the disruption of intercellular connections caused by colitis in STAT3 fl/fl mice, while this effect was not observed in STAT3 DIEC mice (Fig. 6E). Additionally, using TUNEL fluorescence staining, cell apoptosis was found to be highest in the STAT3 fl/fl -DSS group and reduced in the other three groups, with no significant differences between them (Fig. 6F). Immunohistochemical and fluorescence staining showed that treatment with 2'-FL inhibited the elevation of p-STAT3 induced by DSS in STAT3 fl/fl mice (Fig. 6G,H). The protein levels of ZO-1, Occludin, and Bcl2 were higher in the STAT3 DIEC -DSS group than those in the STAT3 fl/fl -DSS group, while the levels of Bax decreased. However, no substantial variations were detected in the levels of these proteins between the STAT3 DIEC -DSS and STAT3 DIEC -DSS\u00fe2'-FL groups (Fig. 6I).\nIn an in vivo model, these findings demonstrate that knockdown of STAT3 reduces the inflammatory response and enhances the intestinal mucosal barrier while compromising the effectiveness of 2'-FL. \n**Knockdown of STAT3 or inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation reduces inflammatory responses and compromises the effectiveness of 2'-FL in vitro**\nThe expression of STAT3 in NCM460 cells was suppressed by siRNA transfection. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed elevated ZO-1 expression in cells transfected with siSTAT3 under LPS stimulation compared to cells transfected with siNC. Moreover, supplementation with 2'-FL did not impact ZO-1 expression in cells with STAT3 knockdown (Fig. 7A). Additionally, immunofluorescence analysis revealed completely reduced STAT3 and p-STAT3 Y705 intensity in cells transfected with siSTAT3, confirming successful STAT3 knockdown (Fig. 7B,C). Knockdown of STAT3 resulted in decreased IL-6 levels upon LPS stimulation. Notably, in LPS-treated cells with STAT3 knockdown, IL-6 levels were similar between the 2'-FL pretreated group and the untreated group (Fig. 7D). The cells were treated with 2 mg/ml 2'-FL for 48 h, followed by co-treatment with 10 mM C25-140 (TRAF6 inhibitor) and LPS (1 mg/ml) for 24 h. STAT3 was labeled in red, and DAPI was used for nuclear staining (blue). (K) WB analysis of protein expression in cells. Semi-quantitative analysis was performed using ImageJ software, with GAPDH as an internal control. Data represent results from three independent experiments and are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM. P-values were determined using student's t-test or one-way ANOVA test; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.) Furthermore, compared to the LPS \u00fe siNC group, the expression of ZO-1, Occludin, and Bcl2 was increased, while Bax expression was decreased in the LPS \u00fe siSTAT3 group, with no significant differences in these proteins between the LPS \u00fe siSTAT3 and LPS \u00fe siSTAT3 \u00fe 2'-FL groups (Fig. 7E).\nTo explore the involvement of Y705 phosphorylation in STAT3 regarding the protective effects of 2'-FL against inflammation, NCM460 cells were transfected with plasmids containing either the wild-type STAT3 or the STAT3 (Y705F) mutant. Interestingly, cells transfected with WT STAT3 plasmids exhibited more robust inflammatory responses to LPS. Conversely, the cells harboring the STAT3 (Y705F) mutation did not exhibit discernible antiinflammatory effects in response to 2'-FL (Fig. 7F).\nThese findings demonstrate that knockdown of STAT3 or inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation at Y705 alleviates the inflammatory response and diminishes the effectiveness of 2'-FL, highlighting the dependence of 2'-FL-mediated inflammation attenuation on STAT3 expression. \n**2'-FL suppresses STAT3 activation by inhibiting STAT3 palmitoylation**\nZhang's study revealed that the activation of STAT3 involves a palmitoylationedepalmitoylation cycle. Specifically, palmitoylation of STAT3 at Cys108 facilitates the recruitment of STAT3 to the membrane, where it is phosphorylated at Y705. Subsequently, p-STAT3 undergoes depalmitoylation to achieve nuclear translocation [16]. To investigate whether 2'-FL suppresses the palmitoylation of STAT3, we conducted an in vitro acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay. The results revealed an increase in palmitoylated STAT3 in LPStreated cells, which was reduced via pretreatment with 2'-FL (Fig. 8A). The expression of Acyl protein thioesterase 2 (APT2), also known as Lysophospholipase 2 (LYPLA2), was investigated as the enzyme responsible for STAT3 depalmitoylation. It was observed that APT2 expression increased in cells stimulated with LPS, and conversely, 2'-FL treatment resulted in the downregulation of APT2 expression (Fig. 8B,C). Furthermore, APT2 levels were elevated in inflamed intestinal mucosa, and 2'-FL intervention attenuated this elevation (Fig. 8D).\nTo evaluate the impact of palmitoylation on STAT3 phosphorylation and the effect of 2'-FL on these post-translational modifications, we generated a STAT3 (C108S) mutant, as Cys108 is the site required for STAT3 palmitoylation. WB analysis showed wild-type STAT3 plasmid, or Y705F mutant plasmid using Lipofectamine 6000, followed by treatment with 2 mg/ml 2'-FL for 48 h and subsequent stimulation with LPS (1 mg/ml) for 24 h. (F) WB analysis of protein expression levels in cells. The data are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and represent the results of at least three independent experiments. P-values were determined using one-way ANOVA test; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. that phosphorylation of STAT3 (C108S) was inhibited compared to WT STAT3, and the phosphorylation status of STAT3 was not affected by 2'-FL treatment in the STAT3 (C108S) group (Fig. 8E). The ABE assay validated the decreased palmitoylation of STAT3 in STAT3 (C108S) cells when compared to both WT STAT3 and STAT3 (Y705F) cells. Significantly, 2'-FL inhibited STAT3 palmitoylation in both WT STAT3 and STAT3 (Y705F) cells (Fig. 8F). These findings support the notion of a palmitoylationedepalmitoylation cycle contributing to the inhibitory effects of 2'-FL on STAT3 activation.

Among the various HMOs, 2'-FL has attracted considerable interest owing to its abundant presence in breast milk [3]. The functions of 2'-FL can be classified based on four main aspects, including its prebiotic effects, direct inhibition of pathogen adhesion [7,28,29], immunoregulatory functions, and promotion of brain development [30,31]. Notably, 2'-FL possesses immunoregulatory properties and has been extensively studied for its role in pediatric necrotizing enterocolitis [32]. In recent years, research on the effects of 2'-FL in the field of IBD has increased.\nIn adults, 2'-FL promotes the proliferation of Bifidobacteriaceae, including Bifidobacterium adolescents and Bifidobacterium longum, especially B. longum [5,33]. A study found that 2'-FL can stimulate the proliferation of pseudo-B. longum. Additionally, 2'-FL may contribute to the improvement of colitis by enhancing the secondary bile acid generation in microbial metabolism and inhibiting the TGR5-mediated NF-kB pathway [6]. Beyond its promoting effect on Bifidobacteria, 2'-FL also fosters the growth of other probiotics in the intestinal tract and inhibits the proliferation of harmful bacteria [5,9,34]. In addition to its regulatory role in the gut microbiota, 2'-FL possesses the direct ability to inhibit pathogen adhesion and suppress the growth of pathogenic bacteria [7,8,28,29]. In a model of colitis, 2'-FL reduced the expression of CD14 in epithelial cells of the intestine, thus alleviating inflammation stimulated by LPS [18]. These research findings underscore the potential of 2'-FL in resisting pathogen infections and mitigating inflammation.\nDuring the preclinical phase of IBD, the integrity of the intestinal barrier is impaired, allowing luminal contents to penetrate deeper tissues, thereby activating immune cells. The ongoing disruption of barrier function and dysregulation of mucosal immune systems eventually lead to tissue damage and the clinically observable IBD [35]. Sultigoj et al.'s research suggests that 2'-FL reduces the permeability of the Caco2 monolayer membrane in in vitro experiments while upregulating the expression of tight junction proteins in both Caco2 cells and chip tissues of human colon [36]. This discovery suggests that 2'-FL contributes to enhancing intestinal barrier function, reducing the permeation of harmful substances, and aiding in alleviating the severity of IBD. Liu et al.'s investigation indicates that, when compared to GOS, 2'-FL exhibits greater efficacy in colitis, characterized by the suppression of inflammation and the enhancement of gut barrier function [6]. In DSS-induced colitis, 2'-FL, as an anti-inflammatory factor, exerts its effects through various mechanisms, including regulating the composition of gut microbiota, promoting the restoration of goblet cells and secretion of mucin, and upregulating the expression of NLRP6 [9,10].\nConsistent with previous studies, we observed that oral administration of 2'-FL led to a notable amelioration of colitis, particularly by fortifying the intestinal barrier against the heightened permeability induced by DSS. In vivo imaging delineated a rapid spread of fluorescence to the liver and spleen in mice with compromised gut barriers due to DSS, contrasting with mice receiving 2'-FL supplementation, where the fluorescent signal predominantly localized within the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, DSS-exposed mice who received only PBS exhibited increased plasma fluorescence, while conversely, mice supplemented with 2'-FL exhibited reduced levels in the plasma and elevated fluorescence intensity in the intestinal. Notably, 2'-FL promoted the expression of the intercellular tight junction components, ZO-1 and Occludin, thereby repairing the ultrastructure of tight junctions. Moreover, 2'-FL enhanced the secretion of the goblet cell mucin protein MUC2, indicating its role in restoring the intestinal mucosal barrier.\nPrevious research suggests that 2'-FL exerts its effects through inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kB pathway, fostering mucin protein secretion and mitigating inflammation [10,37]. Additionally, 2'-FL hinders the binding of E. coli bacteria to epithelial TLR4 by suppressing the expression of the membrane CD14 [18].\nSpecifically, the receptor complex for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) encompasses LBP, MD2, CD14, and TLR4 [23]. Extensive research has illustrated the important role of LBP in facilitating the transfer of LPS to CD14/MD2, consequently triggering the activation of TLR4 [26]. CD14 is present in both membrane (mCD14) and soluble (sCD14) forms. mCD14's transcription and translation can be inhibited by 2'-FL, leading to a reduction in cellular CD14 levels. Furthermore, 2'-FL has the capacity to induce the endocytosis of mCD14 from the cellular surface into the cytoplasm [18]. Consistent with previous studies, our experiments found that 2'-FL inhibited the expression of TLR4 and the phosphorylation of NF-kB. Fascinatingly, our study revealed that pretreatment with 2'-FL downregulated LPS-binding protein (LBP) levels in both the serum and tissues. However, it is essential to acknowledge a limitation in our study, as we did not further validate the alterations in CD14 expression induced by 2'-FL. Subsequent experiments could supplement our findings by delving deeper into understanding the cellular-autonomous mechanisms through which 2'-FL exerts its effects.\nPrevious studies have shown that 2'-FL can inhibit Th17 cells activation and subsequently attenuate immune-related diseases such as psoriasis by suppressing the STAT3 signaling pathway [17]. Extensive research has delved into the role of STAT3 in IBD [13]. Specifically, the activation of STAT3 induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-23, in conjunction with factors such as IL-1b and TGF-b, is associated with the development of Th17 cells. Conversely, the activation of STAT3 in these cells by IL-10 is crucial for the functionality of regulatory T cells (Tregs), particularly in their ability to efficiently suppress concurrent pathogenic Th17 responses [38]. Notably, it was demonstrated that STAT3 is a downstream molecule of TRAF6 and that the TRAF6/STAT3 signaling pathway can trigger neuroinflammatory responses and damage following ischemic stroke [25]. Our proteomic analysis showed that 2'-FL suppressed the STAT3-related signaling pathways that induce inflammation. Moreover, our experiments demonstrated that 2'-FL pretreatment suppressed elevated levels of TRAF6 and phosphorylated STAT3 associated with inflammation. Notably, the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation was further confirmed after treatment with a TRAF6 inhibitor, suggesting that STAT3 might function downstream of TRAF6 in our study model.\nTo delve deeper into the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of 2'-FL in colitis, we established in vitro and in vivo models of STAT3 knockdown and overexpression. Our in vivo experiments revealed that conditional knockout of STAT3 in intestinal epithelial cells inhibited inflammation and promoted intestinal mucosal barrier repair in the DSS-induced colitis model. Importantly, the protective effect of 2'-FL against colitis was attenuated in the context of STAT3 conditional knockout. Consistent findings were observed in our in vitro experiments, where STAT3 silencing or inhibition of Y705 phosphorylation reduced inflammation induced by LPS, and the inhibitory effect of 2'-FL on LPS-induced inflammation was not evident in cells with low STAT3 expression or Y705 mutation. These results highlight the crucial role of STAT3 as a key signaling molecule in mediating the effects of 2'-FL.\nPrevious studies have reported that the palmitoylatione depalmitoylation cycle of STAT3 contributes to its phosphorylation, with C108 being the palmitoylation site of STAT3. Palmitoylation of STAT3 influences its phosphorylation at Y705, while phosphorylation does not have a substantial impact on palmitoylation [16]. It was shown that fatty acids endogenously synthesized by fatty acid synthase can regulate the immune system [39]. These endogenous fatty acids have the potential to transform into palmitoyl-CoA, which then binds to protein cysteine residues through thioester bonds through a process referred to as S-palmitoylation. Palmitoylation mainly functions in stabilizing the membrane association of soluble proteins. While the palmitoylation of many proteins is dynamic, depalmitoylation can mediate membrane release and cytosolic diffusion [40]. In our study, we observed a notable increase in STAT3 palmitoylation levels in the inflammatory model; these levels were effectively attenuated by 2'-FL treatment. Our experiments indicated that 2'-FL also affected STAT3 depalmitoylation, as evidenced by the high expression of the depalmitoylation enzyme APT2 in the inflammatory model and its downregulation following 2'-FL pretreatment. Consistent with previous studies, our research demonstrated that the STAT3 C108 mutation inhibited STAT3 palmitoylation, subsequently suppressing STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation and its detrimental effects on the intestinal mucosal barrier.\nIn conclusion, our findings reveal that 2'-FL restores the intestinal mucosal barrier and alleviates colitis through the STAT3 signaling pathway, especially by inhibiting STAT3 palmitoylation and phosphorylation. 2'-FL downregulates the level of LBP and inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation, leading to decreased expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b, and IFN-g), repair of the intestinal mucosal barrier, and upregulation of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin). Additionally, our study suggests a potential mechanism by which 2'-FL inhibits STAT3 palmitoylationedepalmitoylation, contributing to the suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that 2'-FL might be a valuable oral prophylactic and therapeutic agent to alleviate mucosal inflammation. While we have explored the impact of 2'-FL on LBP, existing literature also suggests that 2'-FL can inhibit the expression of CD14, we did not further validate the alterations in CD14 expression induced by 2'-FL. Moreover, our study did not directly investigate the specific mechanism through which 2'-FL inhibits STAT3 palmitoylationdepalmitoylation. These limitations call for future experiments to supplement and delve further into understanding how 2'-FL operates autonomously at the cellular level.\n\n\nBackground & aims: 2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL), the primary constituent of human milk oligosaccharides, has been identified as a potential regulator of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease. Despite this recognition, the specific mechanisms through which 2'-FL alleviates ulcerative colitis (UC) remain ambiguous. This study seeks to investigate the potential anti-inflammatory properties of 2'-FL concerning intestinal inflammation and uncover the associated mechanisms. Methods: C57BL/6J mice were orally administered a daily dose of 500 mg/kg 2'-FL for 11 consecutive days, followed by the induction of colitis using 3 % (wt/vol) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for the final 6 days. Subsequently, a comprehensive range of techniques, including an Acylebiotin exchange assay, fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled dextran assay, histopathology, ELISA, quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, immunohistochemistry staining, Alcian blue-periodic acid schiff staining, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, transmission electron microscopy, iTRAQ quantitative proteomics, bioinformatics analysis, and the generation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) knockout mice, were employed to explore the relevant molecular mechanisms. Results: Administration of 2'-FL significantly ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in mice and enhanced the integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier. 2'-FL downregulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 and inhibited STAT3-related signaling pathways in colon tissues, which, in turn, reduced inflammatory responses. Interestingly, knockdown of STAT3 attenuated the protective effects of 2'-FL, highlighting that 2'-FL-mediated inflammatory attenuation is dependent on STAT3 expression. Additionally, 2'-FL could influence STAT3 activation by modulating the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of STAT3. Conclusions: 2'-FL promotes the recovery of the intestinal mucosal barrier and suppresses inflammation in ulcerative colitis by inhibiting the palmitoylation and phosphorylation of STAT3.\n\n",
