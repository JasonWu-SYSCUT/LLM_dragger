    "fullText": "**| INTRODUCTION**\nThyroid cancer is the most common primary endocrine malignancy with rapidly increasing mortality (Chen et al., 2023). Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the commonest subtype of thyroid cancer and its risk factors includes ionizing radiation exposure, thyroid nodular disease and the family history (Mao et al., 2020). However, the specific mechanism underlying PTC has not been elucidated so far.\nAlthough PTC is generally recognized as a kind of tumor with low malignancy degree and slow progression and good prognosis than many other types of cancers, some studies have found that mutations of some different genes can cause significant changes in biological behavior and physiology such as tumor progression and metastasis (Lin et al., 2022;Mastronikolis et al., 2020;Yan et al., 2021).\nHypoxia promotes a plethora of genetic and epigenetic changes that effectively alter the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment, leading to increased glycolysis, angiogenesis, and metabolic alterations (Hompland et al., 2021). In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, poor vascularization and nutrient and oxygen deprivation lead to adaptive metabolic cancer cell reprogramming (Ryan et al., 2000;Xia et al., 2021). Hypoxia-induced upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 expression promotes fatty acid metabolism and reduces intracellular lipid accumulation to meet cellular energy requirements (Rios-Colon et al., 2021). Long chain fatty acids are an important source of lipid energy metabolism in cells, especially mitochondria, and have a close influence on the proliferation and metastasis of various tumors (Chu et al., 2023). High fat diet containing mainly palmitic acid can cause the occurrence of B-Raf (V600E) mutation in thyroid cancer (one of the most common mutations in PTC, giving cells greater proliferation and metastasis capacity) (Kim et al., 2022). Moreover, the growth of B-Raf (V600E) mutant cancer cells was significantly inhibited by hyperactivation of MAPK protein phosphatase 2A with long-chain fatty acid analogs (Atiq et al., 2016).\nCarnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A) is one of the most common carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1) family of rate-limiting enzyme for \u03b2-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, which is regulated by many factors at the gene and protein levels (Li et al., 2022;Schlaepfer & Joshi, 2020;Wang et al., 2018). Deficiency or reduction of CPT1A activity lead to limited oxidation of normal fatty acids, resulting in dysfunctions of cells and tissues (Hao et al., 2021;Huang et al., 2021).\nOne study has found that the expression levels of three key enzymes LPL, FATP2 and CPT1A were significantly increased in PTC using metabolomics, proteomic and lipidomics test and high levels of FATP2 and CPT1A may lead to poor prognosis of PTC (Lu et al., 2021). In addition, ectopic overexpression of LPL, FATP2 and CPT1A can promote the migration of thyroid cancer cells (Lu et al., 2021). Lack of CPT1A will prevent cells from meeting the increased energy demands of growth in a hypoxic environment, due to the regulatory role of CPT1A in fatty acid oxidation (Rios-Colon et al., 2021).\nIn this study, we explored the biological roles and mechanisms of CPT1A in PTC cell growth, oxidative stress and apoptosis under hypoxia. We provide evidence to support that CPT1A could be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of PTC patients.\n\n**| MATERIALS AND METHODS**\n**| Cell culture and treatment**\nHuman PTC lines TPC-1, IHH-4, GLAG-66 and normal thyroid cells Nthy-ori 3-1 were obtained from Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. To establish an in vitro hypoxia model, TPC-1 cells were cultured in a Modular Incubator Chamber (Billups-Rothenberg Inc.) with 1% O2, 94% N 2 and 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. After that, the cells were transferred back to full culture medium at an atmosphere with 95% O 2 and 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C. Normal TPC-1 cells were incubated in a regular cell culture condition as a normoxia control. Besides, to research fatty acid metabolism, TPC-1 cells were exposed to 200 \u03bcM palmitic acid (PA; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h after hypoxia.\n**| Cell transfection**\nThe specific shRNA targeting CPT1A (shRNA-CPT1A-1: CAGTGG-TATTTGAAGTTAA; shRNA-CPT1A-2: CCATGAAGCTCTTAGACAA), CPT1A-specific pcDNA overexpression vector (OV-CPT1A), and corresponding control (NC: CCGGCAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAAC TC) were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). These recombinants were transfected into TPC-1 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h transfection, cells were harvested for subsequent experiments.\n**| Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay**\nAfter transfection and treated with or without hypoxia and PA, cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and cultured at 37\u00b0C. After 12, 24, and 48 h, 10 \u00b5L CCK-8 solution was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 h, and the absorbance was measured with a microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 450 nm.\n**| Evaluation of mitochondrial membrane motential (MMP)**\nCationic dye 5, 5\u2032, 6, 6\u2032-tetrachloro-1, 1\u2032, 3, 3-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) staining was conducted to assess mitochondrial membrane motential (MMP). Briefly, after transfected with sh-CPT1A or OV-CPT1A in the presence or absence of hypoxia and PA, TPC-1 cells were collected and incubated with JC-1 for 20 min at 37\u00b0C, and were then detected with fluorescence microscope. Red fluorescence represented a potential-dependent aggregation in the mitochondria, reflecting \u0394\u03a8m. Green emission of the dye represented the monomeric form of JC-1, appearing in the cytosol after mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The wavelengths of excitation and emission were 514 nm and 529 nm for detection of monomeric form of JC-1, while 585 nm and 590 nm were used to detect aggregation of JC-1.\n**| Detection of free fatty acids**\nTPC-1 cells were transfected with sh-CPT1A or OV-CPT1A, followed by treatment of hypoxia with or without PA. Firstly, treated cells were lysed with RIPA buffer for 45 min. Then cell homogenates were obtained by chlo-roform and methanol solution (chloroform: metha-nol=2:1, followed by lipid extraction. The level of free fatty acids was detected by using corresponding commercial kits (Bioassay Systems).\n**| Flow cytometric analysis**\nCell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry using annexin V-PI assay kit. Cells were treated with hypoxia with or without PA for 24 h after transfection. The treated cells were collected for annexin V-PI staining according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences PharMingen). Flowjo software (Tree Star) was applied for apoptosis analysis. were grown, and 5 \u00d7 10 7 /mL cell suspensions were prepared in 100 \u03bcL PBS and subcutaneously injected into the back of each mouse on the right side. Mouse weight and tumor size were monitored daily and recorded, and the tumor volumes were calculated every 3 days using the formula: volume = (length \u00d7 width 2 )/2. Thirty days later, the mice were killed and the tumor was immediately harvested, weighed and collected for following assays.\n**| Xenograft experiments**\n**| Oil red O staining**\nOil Red O staining was carried out to detect the Lipid deposition in tumor tissues of mice from different groups. 0.5 g Oil Red O powder (Sigma Chemical Co.) was evenly dissolved in 100 mL of isopropanol to prepare stock solution, which was then diluted with distilled water at the ratio of 3:2 and filtrated to make working solution. The sections of tumor tissues were fixed and prewetted with 60% isopropanol, and then stained with Oil Red O working solution for 15 min. The positive area was measured with the ImageJ 1.47 software.\n**| Detection of oxidative stress**\nTPC-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well, while the mice tissues were homogenized. Following treatment, the activity of SOD in media was analyzed using a SOD kit from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute. The MDA level was measured with an MDA kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). For colorimetric analysis, the absorbance at 532 nm was recorded using a microplate reader (Spectra Max 190; Molecular Devices, LLC).\n**| Measurement of inflammatory factors**\nThe contents of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in TPC-1 cells and mice tissues were determined with ELISA kits according to the relevant kits. The optical density of each well was assayed at 450 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer. Finally, the contents were calculated according to the standard curves.\n**| Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)**\nTotal RNA was extracted from cells using the TRIzol kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A NanoDrop 3000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) was used to confirm the sufficient quality of total RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Then, the RNA was converted to cDNA by PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara, Japan). The primer sequences for PCR are presented as below: CPT1A: 5\u2032-TGGGATCGATCGTCACCTCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TTTCCAGCCCAGCACATGAA-3\u2032 (reverse); HIF-1\u03b1: 5\u2032-AG AGGTTGAGGGACGGAGAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CTCCGACATTGGG AGCTCAT-3\u2032 (reverse); GAPDH: 5\u2032-GGGAAACTGTGGCGTGAT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GAGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGA-3\u2032 (reverse). The real-time quantitative PCR used ChamQTM SYBR \u00ae qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The relative mRNA level was normalized with GAPDH by 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method.\n**| Western blot analysis assay**\nThe total proteins were extracted from cells and tissues using RIPA buffer (Auragene) and quantified using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Dingguo). An equal amount of protein was loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to a Pure Nitrocellulose Blotting membrane (Pall Life Science). After being blocked with 5% nonfat milk, primary antibodies targeting CPT1A (1:1000, ab220789; Abcam), HIF-1\u03b1 (1:1000, ab1; Abcam), VEGF (1:1000, ab32152; Abcam), Bax (1:1000, ab32503; Abcam), Casp3 (1:1000, ab32351; Abcam), GLUT1 (1:1000, ab150299; Abcam) and GAPDH (1:1000, ab8245; Abcam) were added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The protein bands were detected by an ECL detection system and analyzed by ImageJ software.\n**| Statistical analysis**\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS 23.0 statistical software (SPSS) and GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad SoftwareA). All data were reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The data were in accordance with the normal distribution by Shapiro-Wilk test.\nSignificant differences between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons tests as both normality tests and equality tests passed (SigmaPlot 14.0; Systat Software). Values of p < .05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n**| RESULTS**\n**| Hypoxia promotes the expressions of CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1 in PTC cells**\nFirstly, we detected the mRNA and protein expressions of CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1 in PTC cells. The data showed that the expressions of both CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1 were significantly increased in PTC cells compared with the control cells Nthy-ori 3-1 (Figure 1a-d). Combined with the above results, we chose the cell line TPC-1 for the following assays. Then, TPC-1 cells were placed in hypoxic environment (1% O 2 and 5% CO 2 ) for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. We found that the cell viability of TPC-1 cells were reduced by hypoxia in a timedependent manner (Figure 1e). And, mRNA and protein levels of CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1 were remarkably elevated after hypoxia treatment in this PTC cell line (Figure 1f-i).\n**| The effects of CPT1A expression on PTC cells under hypoxia condition**\nTo investigate the role of CPT1A in PTC progression, we transfected sh-CPT1A-1/2 and OV-CPT1A into TPC-1 cells to knockdown and overexpress CPT1A, respectively. The results from qRT-PCR and western blot assay showed that sh-CPT1A-1 led to lower expression of CPT1A in TPC-1 cells (Figure 2a,b). Therefore, sh-CPT1A-1 was chosen for the subsequent study (named as sh-CPT1A). CCK-8 assay indicated that cell proliferation was notably increased after transfection with OV-CPT1A but inhibited in TPC-1 transfected with sh-CPT1A compared with the negative control (Figure 2c). Then we detected the effects of CPT1A under hypoxia condition on cell proliferation. The data showed that after treatment of hypoxia for 24 h, the cell proliferation declined in each groups. The OV-CPT1A group had the higher cell proliferation capacity compared with the negative control while sh-CPT1A group was lower (Figure 2d). In addition, hypoxia enhanced the levels of ROS and MDA and reduced the activity of SOD. PA treatment further added the ROS and MDA level and decreased SOD activity. However, CPT1A overexpression reversed the effects of hypoxia and PA while CPT1A silencing showed the opposite effects (Figure 2e). The experiments for the detection of inflammation factors showed a similar trend to that of oxidative stress (Figure 2f). Moreover, aggregated JC-1 in mitochondria of control cells exhibited red fluorescence, and exposure to hypoxia and PA increased dissipation of \u0394\u03a8m, with increased green fluorescence (monomeric JC-1) in mitochondria. CPT1A overexpression or silencing increased or reduced the decreased red fluorescence by hypoxia and PA and reduced or increased green fluorescence (Figure 2g).\n**| CPT1A ameliorates PA-induced abnormal lipid metabolism in TPC-1 cells treated with hypoxia**\nAs shown in Figure 3a, PA treatment significantly reduced cell viability of TPC-1 cells after hypoxia. Upregulation of CPT1A rehabilitated the viability after treatment of both hypoxia and PA, and CPT1A silencing further repressed cell viability. In addition, the addition of PA resulted in increased level of free fatty acids in hypoxia-induced TPC-1 cells. CPT1A overexpression reduced the contents of free fatty acids but CPT1A knockdown increased the level of free fatty acids compared with the hypoxia+PA group (Figure 3b). Furthermore, PA evidently elevated the rate of cell apoptosis of hypoxia-induced cells. However, the cell apoptosis was inhibited by transfection with OV-CPT1A and aggravated by transfection with sh-CPT1A (Figure 3c).\n**| CPT1A has an effect on tumor growth and lipid deposition in vivo**\nTo verify the results obtained from cell experiments above, a xenograft PTC mouse model was established by injecting with TPC-1 cells transfected with OV-CPT1A or sh-CPT1A (Figure 4a).\nThe body weight, tumor volume and tumor weight in OV-CPT1A group were greatly higher compared with the negative control, but CPT1A silencing decreased those in mice (Figure 4b-d). Additionally, Oil Red O staining revealed that lipid deposition was significantly decreased after CPT1A overexpression while downregulation of CPT1A obviously increased the level lipid deposition (Figure 4e).\n**| The changes of CPT1A expression influences multiple indicator in mice tumor tissues**\nAs shown in Figure 5a, the levels of ROS and MDA in tumor tissues were found to be abrogated and SOD activity was increased after transfection with OV-CPT1A whereas the tendency was reversed by sh-CPT1A. The production of IL1\u03b2, IL6 and TNF in tumor tissues were inhibited by CPT1A overexpression but promoted by CPT1A silencing (Figure 5b). Moreover, upregulation of CPT1A enhanced the protein levels of HIF-1\u03b1, CPT1A, VEGF and GLUT1 and reduced the generations of Bax and Casp3, whereas CPT1A silencing had the opposite effects on these protein levels in tumor tissues (Figure 5c). Thyroid cancer is one of the most common endocrine tumors, ranking 9th among the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with a global incidence increasing at an annual rate of 20% (Laha et al., 2020).\nPTC is the most frequent pathologic type, accounting for more than 85% of thyroid cancers (Ijaz & Yin, 2023). PTC usually has a favorable prognosis, with a 5-year postoperative survival rate of more than 90%, and some are even considered not to require immediate surgery (Lam, 2022). However, due to the multifocal nature of PTC and early  lymph node metastasis, the recurrence rate is as high as 35%, and the 10-year disease-specific survival rate for progressive PTC is less than 50% (Maciel et al., 2022). In this study, we found that Hypoxia affected PTC cell viability, oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid metabolism and even apoptosis. Overexpression of CPT1A reversed the bad effects of hypoxia on PTC cells and promoted lipid metabolism reprogramming to help cells adapt to low oxygen environment and restrain mechanism of cell death.\nHypoxia is an important factor in promoting thyroid cancer progression and metastasis (Bao & Wong, 2021). Indeed, solid tumors often grow in a hypoxic environment and thus their biological properties are already altered (Chen & Lou, 2017;Chiu et al., 2017;Park et al., 2023). In this state, hypoxia-inducible factors play important roles, and the upregulation of HIF-1\u03b1 leads to a series of changes, including the promotion of erythropoiesis, the increase of oxygen supply to tumor tissues, the promotion of intra-tumor angiogenesis, the mediation of glycolytic function in the state of ischemia and hypoxia, and the inhibition of apoptosis (Sch\u00f6del et al., 2016). In this study, we found that hypoxia brought about lower cell viability, higher expressions of CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1, higher levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory response.\nMetabolic reprogramming helps tumor cells alter their metabolic capacity to support increased energy demands due to their rapid growth and proliferation (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2011). Rapidly proliferating cells such as cancer cells show the alteration of lipid metabolism (Luo et al., 2017). Numerous evidence show that reprogramming of fatty acids metabolism happens in lung, prostate, gastric, ovarian and breast cancer cells, with the characteristics of active fatty acids synthesis and/or \u03b2-oxidation (Mashima et al., 2009;Orita et al., 2008). Some studies have reported the changes of fatty  et al., 2018;Lu et al., 2016). Lu et al. performed a Multi-Omics analysis of fatty acid metabolism in thyroid carcinoma and fount that CPT1A expression level was significantly elevated in PTC, and it is possible that high level of CPT1A was associated with poor prognosis in PTC (Lu et al., 2021). Our results also showed that the levels of CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1were upregulated in several PTC cell lines compared with the Nthy-ori 3-1 control cells.\nCPT1 family is the first rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), playing a significant role in metabolic adaptation in cancer pathogenesis (Casals et al., 2016). CPT1A is one member of CPT1 family and controls the entry of fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation (Tan et al., 2018). HIF-1\u03b1 also has an effect on cellular lipid metabolism (Seo et al., 2020). In addition, upregulated HIF-1\u03b1 can promote fatty acid metabolism, maintain cellular energy demand, and reduce intracellular lipid accumulation by activating pathway pathways such PPARs in a hypoxic environment (Lee et al., 2021). At the same time, HIF-1\u03b1 enhances the expression activity of fatty acid metabolizing enzymes and antioxidative stress enzymes, so that reactive oxygen species or peroxides generated during mitochondrial metabolism can be reduced and degraded, thus reducing cellular oxidative stress injury (Jassim et al., 2021;Li et al., 2019). In the current study, we overexpressed and silenced CPT1A to explore the effects of CPT1A expression on cell injury and fatty acid metabolism in PTC cells. The data revealed that CPT1A overexpression reduced the cell injury induced by hypoxia by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammatory response, as well as maintaining MMP. Moreover, the treatment of PA further exacerbated hypoxia-induced cell damage, and CPT1A overexpression reversed the effects of PA by reducing free fatty acid and inhibiting cell apoptosis. Animal experiments also proved the results from our cell assays. CPT1A overexpression aggravated PTC tumor growth and reduced lipid deposition in tissues. However, CPT1A silencing revealed opposite effects to CPT1A overexpression in each experiments. It's worth noting that HIF-1 has been proved to alter lipid accumulation, beta-oxidation and lipolysis in cancer, but we did not deeply observe the relationship between CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1 in PTC, which need to be explored in further study.\nIn summary, we demonstrated that hypoxia reprogrammed the lipid metabolism of PTC cells to adapt to the hypoxic environment by inducing high expression of CPT1A, which resulted in supplying tumor cells with energy while inhibiting oxidative stress-induced cellular damage (especially mitochondria) and apoptosis. CPT1A dysregulation has an important role in hypoxia-induced pathological processes in PTC development, which not only enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of hypoxia-regulated cancer but also lead to the development of novel therapeutic targets for PTC treatment.\n\n\nHypoxia has been reported to promote the proliferation and migration of thyroid cancer, while the special mechanism was still unclear. HIF-1\u03b1/carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) was found to be associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) but the biological role of CPT1A in PTC was not explored. The effects of hypoxia and carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A) expression on PTC cells were determined by cell counting kit-8 assay, detection of oxidative stress, inflammation response and mitochondrial membrane motential (MMP). Oil Red O staining and the detection of free fatty acids were performed to assess the status of lipid metabolism. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to assess cell apoptosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis were applied to investigate the expressions of CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1 and the molecules involved cell function. The expressions of CPT1A and HIF-1\u03b1 were significantly increased in PTC cells with or without hypoxia treatment. CPT1A overexpression or silencing promoted or inhibited cell viability, and hypoxia further repressed cell viability. In addition, CPT1A overexpression alleviates hypoxia-induced increased oxidative stress, inflammation response and elevated MMP. CPT1A overexpression enhanced palmitic acid-induced decreased cell growth, enhanced the metabolic capacity of free fatty acid and suppressed cell apoptosis. Animal experiments showed that CPT1A overexpression promoted PTC tumor growth, reduced lipid deposition, oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as enhancing cell function indicators. However, CPT1A silencing showed the opposite effects both in vitro and in vivo. Hypoxia induces the high expression of HIF-1\u03b1/CPT1A, thereby reprogramming the lipid metabolism of PTC cells for adapting the hypoxia environment, meanwhile inhibiting the cell damage and apoptosis caused by oxidative stress.\n\n",
