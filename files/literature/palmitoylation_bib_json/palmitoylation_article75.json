    "abstract": "Toll-like receptor (TLR)/myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MYD88) signaling aggravates sepsis by impairing neutrophil migration to infection sites. However, the role of intracellular fatty acids in TLR/MYD88 signaling is unclear. Here, inhibition of fatty acid synthase by C75 improved neutrophil chemotaxis and increased the survival of mice with sepsis in cecal ligation puncture and lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock models. C75 specifically blocked TLR/MYD88 signaling in neutrophils. Treatment with GSK2194069 that targets a different domain of fatty acid synthase, did not block TLR signaling or MYD88 palmitoylation. De novo fatty acid synthesis and CD36-mediated exogenous fatty acid incorporation contributed to MYD88 palmitoylation. The binding of IRAK4 to the MYD88 intermediate domain and downstream signal activation required MYD88 palmitoylation at cysteine 113. MYD88 was palmitoylated by ZDHHC6, and ZDHHC6 knockdown decreased MYD88 palmitoylation and TLR/MYD88 activation upon lipopolysaccharide stimulus. Thus, intracellular saturated fatty acid-dependent palmitoylation of MYD88 by ZDHHC6 is a therapeutic target of sepsis.\n",

    "fullText": "**S**\nepsis is a life-threatening systemic inflammation due to dysregulation of the host response to bacterial infection and causes more than 250,000 annual deaths in the United States as well as a great medical-care cost burden to patients 1 . Numerous clinical trials with the aim of alleviating septic conditions have been unsuccessful 2 . Upon infection, neutrophils protect the host using bactericidal signals through interleukin (IL)-8/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) and formylated peptide/formyl peptide receptor 3 . Under septic conditions, however, such bactericidal activity of neutrophils is impaired because of the uncontrollable activation of inflammatory signaling through TLR/MYD88, making neutrophils less apoptotic and chemotactic 4 . Thus, developing methods of suppressing the TLR/MYD88 response without affecting the signaling pathway of CXCR2 or formyl peptide receptor may prevent host damage, while maintaining the antibacterial activity of neutrophils, leading to improved survival of patients with sepsis and breakthroughs in the clinical setting.\nSaturated fatty acid (SFA) activates TLR signaling and generates proinflammatory conditions 5 . However, the precise mechanism by which SFA facilitates TLR responses remains poorly understood. Previously, numerous studies have focused on exogenous SFA, which has been suggested to directly stimulate TLR 6 or to change the lipid raft composition of the plasma membrane 7 . However, a recent paper challenged the current concept, with structural evidence showing that SFA is not a TLR4 agonist, suggesting a different method of activating TLRs by SFA 8 . In contrast, fatty acid synthase (FASN) generates endogenous de novo fatty acids that are also important regulators of signal transduction; emerging evidence suggests that endogenous fatty acids regulate inflammation and the immune system 9,10 . We predicted that fatty acids can modulate TLR signaling in a different manner from the established route.\nEndogenous fatty acids synthesized by FASN can be converted to palmitoyl-CoA and incorporated into cysteine residues of the protein via thioester linkage in a process known as S-palmitoylation. Extensive studies have revealed diverse roles of palmitoylation in protein trafficking and subcellular localization 11 . However, very little is known about whether palmitoylation directly influences inflammatory signaling, particularly TLR/MYD88 signaling, and whether it is dynamically regulated in the immune system.\nHere, we demonstrate that treatment with C75 (1), an FASN inhibitor, enhanced the chemotactic activity of neutrophils and improved the survival of mice under septic conditions in vivo.\nIn vitro experiments showed that MYD88, a common adapter molecule in the TLR family, was palmitoylated. By comparing the effects of different FASN inhibitors, we demonstrated that MYD88 palmitoylation is affected by both de novo fatty acid synthesis and CD36mediated exogenous fatty acid incorporation. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that MYD88 was palmitoylated at cysteine 113 and cysteine 274. The ZDHHC6 enzyme was the strongest candidate for MYD88-specific palmitoyl-acyl transferase (PAT). In vitro analyses of MYD88 palmitoylation after treatment with FASN inhibitors, cysteine mutagenesis or PAT knockdown decreased the TLR4 response, revealing a novel regulatory mechanism of inflammation.\n\n**Results**\nC75, a FASN inhibitor, improves the survival of septic mice. To investigate the potential role of endogenous fatty acid synthesis in inflammation, C57BL/6J mice subjected to a cecal ligation puncture (CLP) were treated with C75 (Fig. 1a). Compared to DMSOtreated mice, C75-pretreated mice (4 h before CLP procedure) had a higher survival rate and the median overall survival was extended from 4.0-8.5 d (Fig. 1b); additionally, a lower bacterial burden was\n**Toll-like receptor mediated inflammation requires FASN-dependent MYD88 palmitoylation**\nArticles Nature ChemiCal Biology observed in the peritoneal exudate (Fig. 1c), suggesting that the FASN inhibitor may be useful as a therapeutic agent under early septic conditions. In another in vivo model intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 45 mg kg -1 ), C75-pretreated mice showed better survival (Supplementary Fig. 1). LPS-induced inflammation at the bacterial infection site is known to impair neutrophil migration. This process involves p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation that can promote CXCR2 internalization to desensitize bactericidal signals produced by neighboring cells 4,12 . We found that C75 treatment inhibited LPS-induced internalization of surface CXCR2 (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2) and improved the chemotactic ability of neutrophils toward only IL-8 in the presence of LPS by blocking LPS-induced activation of TLR signaling (Fig. 1e). An enhanced chemotactic response to IL-8 was also observed when FASN expression was downregulated by human short hairpin RNA in a DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cell line (Fig. 1f). These data indicate that inhibiting FASN prevents the desensitization of neutrophils, such as internalization of CXCR2, upon bacterial infection. Taken together, pharmacologic inhibition of FASN may play a therapeutic role in vivo by effectively inhibiting septic inflammation and improving survival by modulating TLR signaling.\nFASN inhibitor specifically decreases TLR signaling. To explain the observed in vivo effect of C75 in TLR-mediated inflammation, we isolated neutrophils and exposed them in vitro to three differ-ent stimulants, namely LPS, IL-8 or N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP). We evaluated whether neutrophil activation was prevented by pretreatment with C75 13 . All three stimulants resulted in a dented and activated morphology of neutrophils in the DMSO-pretreated control group; C75 treatment specifically blocked LPS-induced morphological changes, whereas it did not affect IL-8or fMLP-induced neutrophil activation (Fig. 2a). We also performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of neutrophil activation, such as the shedding of L-selectin and induction of CD11b. C75, a FASN inhibitor, blocked only LPS-induced neutrophil activation but not IL-8-or fMLP-induced activation (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, treatment with C75 effectively blocked LPS-induced p38MAPK activation in neutrophils (Fig. 2c). To rule out the possibility that the observed effect was due to C75 toxicity, we analyzed the apoptotic cell population after pretreatment of C75 in human neutrophils and observed no significant difference in the nonapoptotic cell population (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, gross morphology did not differ between the two groups. Because neutrophils are the first leukocytes to be recruited to an inflammatory site, we used a 'carrageenan-induced air pouch' model 14 to determine whether FASN inhibition inhibits TLR-dependent neutrophil migration in vivo. When inflammation was induced by carrageenan to stimulate TLR4 signaling in the air pouch, C75-pretreated mice showed fewer infiltrated neutrophils than DMSO-pretreated mice (Fig. 2d). Thus, our results demonstrate that C75 specifically inhibits TLR-induced neutrophil activation in vitro and in vivo. \n**Articles**\n**Nature ChemiCal Biology**\nIn TLR signaling, each adapter is differentially used by different receptor complexes. To further investigate the inhibitory mechanism of C75 in TLR signaling, we used purified Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 agonist), LPS (TLR4 agonist) and R848 (TLR7-8 agonist) to activate different TLR signaling pathways. Agonist-induced neutrophil activation was blocked by C75, maintaining the normal and round morphology of the cells (Fig. 2e). Transcript levels of the MYD88dependent proinflammatory cytokine TNF messenger RNA were downregulated by C75, while those of the MYD88-independent proinflammatory cytokine IFNB1 mRNA were unaffected in neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b). A previous study showed that the MYD88-independent pathway (TLR3) is not activated in mature human neutrophils 15 and our data suggest that C75 inhibits only MYD88-dependent pathways. We therefore hypothesized that C75 acts downstream of a common adapter molecule of TLR signaling, MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. 4c).\n**FASN regulates MYD88-dependent inflammation.**\nTo search for a downstream molecular target of C75, we used the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB luciferase gene reporter system. At the plasma membrane level, LPS-activated NF-\u03baB luciferase, which was dosedependently blocked by C75 in hTLR4-293T cells. However, at the submembrane or cytoplasmic level, overexpression of MYD88, TRAF6, IKBKB or RELA activated NF-\u03baB luciferase, which was not blocked by C75 (Fig. 3a). Because MYD88 overexpression can cause death-domain self-dimerization and subsequent nonspecific downstream activation independently of TLR [16][17][18] , we generated a MYD88-GyrB stable cell line from hTLR4-293T cells by fusing the C-terminus of MYD88 with the subunit of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase 17,19 . MYD88-GyrB dimerizes only on binding with the Streptomyces product, coumermycin (2), and elicits the TLR signal to bypass the TLR4 surface receptor. In the MYD88-GyrB stable cell line, dimerization of MYD88 by coumermycin activated phospho-p65 and degraded I\u03baB\u03b1 that was dose-dependently blocked by C75 (Fig. 3b). Consistent results were obtained in the NF-\u03baB luciferase assay in which C75 blocked coumermycin-induced NF-\u03baB activation (Supplementary Fig. 5) and the reduction in NF-\u03baB activity was similar to that observed following genetic inhibition of FASN with targeting shRNA (Fig. 3c). Taken together, these results indicate that C75 targets the machinery of MYD88 dimerization such as the intermediate (INT) or TIR domain of MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. 6).\nTo investigate the direct effect of FASN on MYD88, coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays were conducted. The results suggest a physical interaction between FASN and MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Because FASN is an enzyme known to produce palmitate as its primary product, we evaluated MYD88 palmitoylation. GPS-Lipid, a free software recently developed for the comprehensive prediction of lipid modification sites 20 , supported our hypothesis that at a default threshold, cysteine at positions 113, 166, 192 and 274 were identified as potent S-palmitoylation sites in the MYD88 protein (Supplementary Fig. 8). Accordingly, the NF-\u03baB luciferase assay revealed that treatment with a well-known palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) (3), decreased NF-\u03baB activation, while treatment with palmostatin B (4) 21 that is known to increase steady-state palmitoylation by inhibiting depalmitoylating enzyme acyl-protein thioesterase-1, enhanced NF-\u03baB activation in the MYD88-GyrB stable cell line treated with coumermycin (Fig. 3d). Additionally, when all cysteine residues were mutated to alanine (MYD88-CA), both coumermycin-and LPS-induced p38MAPK activation were inhibited (Supplementary Fig. 9a,b). The competitive inhibitor of coumermycin, novobiocin, completely blocked coumermycin-induced p38MAPK activation (Supplementary Fig. 9c), confirming that the MYD88-GyrB fusion protein does not exhibit nonspecific activation unless cells are exposed to coumermy-cin stimulation. Therefore, the cysteine residues of MYD88 are important in TLR signaling and FASN-associated palmitoylation may account for the mechanism of MYD88-dependent TLR signaling activation.\nTwo sources of palmitate for MYD88 palmitoylation. We used an in vitro acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay and click chemistry method to test the palmitoylation of MYD88. After transiently overexpressing wild-type (WT) MYD88 and CS-mutant MYD88, in which all cysteine residues were mutated to serine (MYD88-CS), we detected a specific band in the hydroxylamine-treated sample of WT MYD88, whereas it completely disappeared in MYD88-CS (Fig. 4a). Moreover, treatment with 2-BP significantly inhibited WT MYD88 palmitoylation (Supplementary Fig. 10a). The click chemistry method also revealed palmitoylated MYD88 only in the 17-octadecynoic acid (ODYA) (5)-treated group. Treatment with hydroxylamine completely detached 17-ODYA-labeled MYD88, confirming that the detected band was specific for palmitoylated MYD88 (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, an In-Gel fluorescence detection method after the click reaction revealed a distinct band the size of MYD88 in the 17-ODYA-treated group (Supplementary Fig. 10b), confirming MYD88 palmitoylation. MYD88 palmitoylation was nearly completely blocked 2 h after C75 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 10c) and was not induced by LPS (Supplementary Fig. 10d). The observed palmitoylated MYD88 was also detected in endogenous THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 10e).\nOn the basis of our hypothesis that FASN is required to supply the endogenous fatty acids required for MYD88 palmitoylation, shFASN RAW264.7 cells were generated to evaluate the changes in MYD88 palmitoylation levels. The ABE assay demonstrated that MYD88 palmitoylation was reduced in shFASN cells compared to control cells (Fig. 4c). Furthermore, pretreatment with C75 and cerulenin (6) effectively inhibited MYD88 palmitoylation in hTLR4-293T-GyrB cells (Supplementary Fig. 10f), suggesting that MYD88 is FASN-dependently palmitoylated. However, treatment with another potent FASN chemical inhibitor, GSK2194069 (7), did not inhibit MYD88 palmitoylation and TLR activation (Supplementary Fig. 11). Previous studies showed that FASN protein can regulate membrane cholesterol levels 10 , which is important for the influx of exogenous palmitate and that different chemical inhibitors that bind to different subdomains of FASN may have different impacts on cholesterol synthesis 22 . C75 or cerulenin inhibits FASN in the ketoacyl synthase domain, which may decrease the production of acetoacetyl-CoA, a potent precursor of cholesterol synthesis, leading to decreased cholesterol synthesis. In contrast, GSK2194069 inhibits the ketoacyl reductase domain of FASN and increases acetoacetyl-CoA levels, leading to increased cholesterol synthesis. We hypothesized that the FASN protein maintains the total intracellular palmitate pool by both regulating the influx of exogenous fatty acids through membrane cholesterol level and producing endogenous fatty acids. We examined whether treatment with cholesterol reversed the C75mediated inhibition of MYD88 palmitoylation. Treatment with acetoacetyl-CoA, \u03b2-hydroxy \u03b2-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA and cholesterol reversed C75 inhibition of MYD88 palmitoylation, while treatment with exogenous palmitate alone did not (Fig. 4d). This result suggests that the mechanisms of C75 to inhibit MYD88 palmitoylation are twofold: (1) inhibition of de novo synthesis of endogenous palmitate and (2) suppression of membrane cholesterol contents leading to decreased influx of exogenous palmitate. We hypothesized that, in contrast to C75, GSK2194069 may increase membrane cholesterol leading to the influx of exogenous palmitate. To further validate our hypothesis, we treated MYD88-transfected hTLR4-293T cells with GSK2194069 during culture in delipidated FBS media to block both, de novo synthesis of endogenous palmitates and influx of exogenous palmitate. The \n**Articles**\nNature ChemiCal Biology result showed that depleting exogenous fatty acids and inhibiting de novo fatty acid synthesis blocked MYD88 palmitoylation (Supplementary Fig. 12a) and TLR signaling (Supplementary Fig. 12b). Next, to evaluate the effect of blocking exogenous fatty acid transport on MYD88 palmitoylation, we treated the cells with 50 \u00b5M of sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) (8), an inhibitor of the long-chain fatty acid transporter, CD36. Either SSO (inhibitor of influx of exogenous palmitate) or GSK2194069 (inhibitor of synthesis of endogenous palmitate) alone slightly decreased the amount of MYD88 palmitoylation. But, combination treatment with SSO and GSK2194069 completely blocked MYD88 palmitoylation (Supplementary Fig. 12c) and LPS-activated TLR signaling (Supplementary Fig. 12d). These results suggest that a total intracellular palmitate pool comprising both de novo-synthesized palmitate and incorporated exogenous palmitate is an important source of palmitate-mediated posttranslational modification of MYD88.\nMYD88 is palmitoylated at cysteine 113 and 274. MYD88 protein contains nine cysteine residues, all of which are highly conserved among vertebrates. Only the first residue (C113) resides in the INT domain, while others are within the TIR domain (Supplementary Fig. 13). To identify specific palmitoylation sites in MYD88, we performed MS analysis. Briefly, (1) the free sulfhydryl groups were bound and blocked with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM); (2) the palmitoylated cysteine residue was de-palmitoylated by treatment with hydroxylamine; (3) cysteine residues that were initially palmitoylated and then de-palmitoylated with hydroxylamine were bound and marked with N-methylmaleimide (NMM) 23 (Supplementary Fig. 14a). Liquid chromatography-mass \n**Articles**\nNature ChemiCal Biology spectrometry analysis identified two NMM-modified MYD88 peptides containing Cys 113 and Cys 274 positions (Fig. 4e). Collisioninduced dissociation analysis of the precursor ion at m/z 780.72 identified an NMM modification at the Cys 113 position with high confidence (Supplementary Fig. 14b), while modification of NMM in the Cys 274 showed low confidence but the corresponding MS2 spectrum supported the modification (Supplementary Fig. 14c).\nTo confirm the predicted palmitoylation sites from MS analysis, an ABE assay was performed using hTLR4-293T cells transiently overexpressing a series of mutant MYD88-GyrB plasmids: MyD88 C113A, C274A, C113/274A or CA mutant plasmid. Compared to WT MYD88, all mutant MYD88 (C113A, C274A, C113/274A and CA) showed decreased palmitoylation levels (Fig. 4f), confirming that the C113 and C274 residues were palmitoylated.\n**IRAK4 recruitment requires MYD88 palmitoylation.**\nTo evaluate the function of MYD88 palmitoylation, NF-\u03baB luciferase activity was measured using WT and various mutant MYD88-GyrB stable cell lines. The dimerization inducer, coumermycin, activated NF-\u03baB luciferase, which was significantly inhibited in the C113A and CA mutants. As expected, when alanine at position 113 was reversed back to cysteine from the CA mutant (CA113C), NF-\u03baB luciferase activity was rescued (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, p38MAPK signal activation induced by coumermycin in MYD88-GyrB stable cells was effectively inhibited in the C113A mutant and completely inhibited in the CA mutant that was partially rescued in the CA113C reverse mutant (Fig. 5b).\nPrevious studies suggested that an alternatively spliced variant of MYD88 that lacks an INT domain, negatively regulates IL-1/ TLR signaling because of defective IRAK4 recruitment to the myddosome complex 24,25 . Moreover, amino acids in MYD88 critical for IRAK4 binding (E110, E111 and D112) are adjacent to C113 within the INT domain 26 . We therefore hypothesized that C113 palmitoylation affects IRAK4 recruitment during signal transmission. Compared to WT MYD88, CA and C113A MYD88 failed to interact with IRAK4; however, the CA113C reverse mutant restored the interaction with IRAK4, confirming the importance of MYD88 C113 palmitoylation in recruiting IRAK4 (Fig. 5c). To rule out the possibility that defective binding with IRAK4 occurs because of structural disruption by alanine mutation, we used a chemical FASN inhibitor and palmitoylation inhibitor, C75 and 2-BP, respectively. Binding of IRAK4 to MYD88 was significantly retarded by C75 or 2-BP, confirming that FASN-dependent MYD88 palmitoylation is crucial for IRAK4 recruitment (Fig. 5d). In contrast, MYD88 palmitoylation did not affect its self-dimerization, indicating a specific role for palmitoylation in the INT domain of MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. 15). Moreover, mutating the E52 of MYD88, which was previously reported as a key amino acid for IRAK4 \n**Articles**\nNature ChemiCal Biology binding 27 , to alanine (E52A) had no effect on NF-\u03baB activation by MYD88 overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 16), indicating that in vitro activation of NF-\u03baB in an MYD88 overexpression model by its self-dimerization was independent of IRAK4 and could not be blocked by the FASN inhibitor.\n**ZDHHC6 palmitoylates MYD88.**\nProtein palmitoylation is mediated by a family of PAT enzymes containing a conserved zinc-finger domain and DHHC motif (ZDHHC) 28 . A total of 23 mammalian ZDHHC proteins have been identified, 17 of which are known to have PAT activity 29,30 . We screened all 23 ZDHHC enzymes to identify the one responsible for MYD88 palmitoylation. First, we tested the mRNA expression of 23 enzymes in THP-1 and RAW264.7 cells by real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. 17a). Next, we performed an overexpression screening assay 31 involving overexpression of each ZDHHC plasmid to identify any palmitoyltransferases targeting MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. 17b). We selected ZDHHC6 as a potent palmitoyltransferase for MYD88 as (1) abundant expression was observed in both cell lines and (2) overexpression increased MYD88 palmitoylation. A proximity ligation assay revealed an \n**Articles**\nNature ChemiCal Biology endogenous MYD88-ZDHHC6 interaction in the perinuclear region (Fig. 6a) and coimmunoprecipitation in FLAG-ZDHHC6overexpressing cell lysates showed potent interactions with endogenous MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. 18). We performed an ABE assay using shZDHHC6 RAW264.7 cells to monitor changes in MYD88 palmitoylation levels. In contrast to shNT control cells, different clones of shZDHHC6 cells failed to palmitoylate MYD88 (Fig. 6b).\nIn contrast, when FLAG-ZDHHC6 was overexpressed in hTLR4-293T cells, the level of MYD88 palmitoylation was higher than in the control group (Fig. 6c). To validate the functional significance of these results, we designed shZDHHC6 knockdown cell lines and tested the activation of the downstream signal by LPS in shZDHHC6 cells. Compared to shNT cells, shZDHHC6 cells showed markedly reduced p38MAPK (Fig. 6d) and NF-\u03baB p65 activation (Fig. 6e). We also observed a similar pattern of TLR signaling inhibition using siRNA targeting ZDHHC6 (Supplementary Fig. 19). Taking these results together, the ZDHHC6 enzyme may be a potent palmitoyltransferase responsible for MYD88 palmitoylation in macrophages and neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 20).\n\n**Discussion**\nThere has been great expansion in our knowledge of fatty acid metabolism and its possible role in modulating inflammatory conditions. However, the direct molecular mechanisms underlying how endogenously synthesized free fatty acids contribute to the innate immune responses remain less well understood. In most cancer cells, de novo fatty acid synthesis is often facilitated to synthesize membranes and signaling molecules 32 . In contrast, in normal cells, exogenous lipids act as ligands for nuclear hormone receptors including LXR, RXR and PPARs to transmit proper inflammatory signals 33,34 . The possible involvement of endogenous fatty acids in normal cell inflammation has recently been suggested; FASN, a producer of endogenous free fatty acids, is activated in LPS-induced macrophages 10,35 . Moreover, alternating membrane lipid compositions controlled by fatty acid metabolism are thought to modulate TLR4 signaling in the innate immune system 33,36 . We identified a previously undescribed neutrophil response to the FASN inhibitor C75 which is specific for MYD88-dependent TLR signaling pathways. Our identification of a previously unknown palmitoylation of the common adapter molecule MYD88 provides mechanistic insight into how MYD88-dependent TLR signaling is associated with endogenous fatty acid metabolism.\nAlthough we identified two palmitoylation sites (C113 and C274) in MYD88 protein, p38MAPK and NF\u03baB-p65 activation was significantly impaired in C113A MYD88. Notably, C113A MYD88 alone showed defective IRAK4 binding, emphasizing the importance of C113 palmitoylation in facilitating TLR signaling. Our finding is consistent with previous findings showing that the INT domain of MYD88 is critical for IRAK4 recruitment and subsequent downstream TLR activation. Because IRAK4 is downstream of MYD88, MYD88 palmitoylation in IRAK4 recruitment is in conflict with the finding that NF-\u03baB activation by MYD88 overexpression was not blocked by the FASN inhibitor. However, even when we mutated the death domain residing in E52 of MYD88 that was previously reported as a key amino acid for IRAK4 binding 27 , to alanine (E52A), NF-\u03baB was activated by overexpression of E52A MYD88. This result indicates that C113 MYD88 palmitoylation in association with IRAK4 is a physiologically relevant mechanism, whereas in vitro NF-kB activation by MYD88 overexpression is independent of IRAK4.\nIntracellular dynamics of palmitoylation are regulated by a family of 23 ZDHHC enzymes that are defined by the presence of a conserved 51-amino acid zinc-finger domain containing a highly conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) tetra peptide. Most ZDHHC enzymes localize to cellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane 37 . In this study, we showed that ZDHHC6 catalyzes MYD88 palmitoylation and observed downregulated inflammatory responses when ZDHHC6 was knocked down. Some pleiotropic mechanisms may exist to decrease the inflammatory response by knockdown of ZDHHC6, as ZDHHC6 was previously shown to palmitoylate calnexin 38 and regulate the functions of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 39 . However, we detected a palmitoyltransferase targeting MYD88 that participates in modulating TLR signaling in the innate immune system. In terms of spatial arrangement, ZDHHC6 localizes primarily in the ER 37 ; how cytosolic MYD88 interacts with ZDHHC6 remains unclear. One possible explanation is the location where MYD88 mRNA is translated. Recent transcriptome-based studies have suggested that not only secretory and membrane-targeted proteins but also cytosolic proteins can be translated in ribosomes associated with the ER 40 . We identified a ZDHHC6-MYD88 interaction that regulates inflammatory responses to bacteria, providing insight into how membraneassociated ZDHHC proteins are associated with cytosolic protein and its palmitoylation.\nFASN is involved in S-palmitoylation of important proteins, such as Wnt-1 in prostate cancer cells 41 , endothelial nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells 42 and Mucin2 in the colonic epithelium 43 . As some proteins were reported to be FASN-dependently palmitoylated 42 , we examined the mechanism of FASN-dependent MYD88 palmitoylation. Our study suggests that FASN plays an important role in maintaining the total intracellular palmitate pool both by de novo fatty acid synthesis and by maintaining exogenous fatty acid uptake via controlling membrane cholesterol levels. Our data are consistent with those in macrophage lineagespecific FASN knockout mice showing an attenuated response to inflammation with changes in lipid composition 10 . We also found that ZDHHC6 is a potent enzyme that palmitoylates MYD88 protein. This model may have clinical implications, as no specific palmitoylation inhibitors have been identified to date. 2-BP is widely used to verify the function of palmitoylation of a specific protein, but it is also a nonselective inhibitor of many lipid enzymes 44 . Other drugs such as cerulenin 45 and tunicamycin are indirect palmitoylation inhibitors that inhibit FASN. Although the effects of the C75 inhibitors on cellular physiology were confirmed with genetic inhibition of FASN in our current study, C75 is nonspecific and can activate CPT1 46 . This study overcomes these limitations by providing clinically applicable insights into a drug or small molecule which can modulate ZDHHC6 activity for developing a specific modulator of innate immune functions while minimizing off-target effects.\nIn summary, our results reveal how bacterial toxin LPS activates NF-\u03baB through TLR4 and MYD88 in neutrophils. The key step is the palmitoylation of C113 in the INT domain of MYD88 by ZDHHC6 enzyme using intracellular palmitic acids either from endogenous fatty acids synthesized by FASN or from exogenous fatty acids supplied by CD36-mediated uptake. In in vitro and animal experiments, blocking MYD88 palmitoylation in neutrophils suppressed TLR-induced inflammation and enhanced the chemotactic activity of neutrophils, improving the survival of mice with sepsis. This study directly demonstrates that endogenous fatty acids modulate innate immune function and suggests a therapeutic niche for controlling sepsis.\n**online content**\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, statements of code and data availability and associated accession codes are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41589-019-0344-0. \n**Articles**\n**Nature ChemiCal Biology**\n\n**Methods**\nExperimental procedures.

The hTLR4-293T and HEK-293T cells were cultured in DMEM highglucose supplemented with 10% FBS (Welgene), 1X penicillin and streptomycin and 1X normocin (InvivoGen). RAW264.7 (mouse macrophage cell line) and THP-1 (human monocytic cell line) cells were maintained in RPMI high-glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X penicillin and streptomycin. Most culture media were from Gibco unless otherwise noted. Delipidated FBS (900-123, lot no. A24F02G) was purchased from Gemini Bio-Products. DMSO, LPS (E. coli; serotype O26:B6), 2-BP, cerulenin, puromycin, acetoacetyl-CoA, HMG-CoA, water-soluble cholesterol, palmitic acid, coumermycin A1 and novobiocin were from Sigma-Aldrich. C75 (10005270, lot no. 05040302), 17-ODYA, GSK2194069 and SSO were obtained from Cayman Chemical. From the manufacturer, the purity of C75 was confirmed by HPLC (100% purity) and the identity of C75 was confirmed by MS and IR. Palmostatin B was from Calbiochem. LPS-EB Ultrapure, Pam3CSK4 and R848 were from InvivoGen.\nHuman neutrophil isolation. Blood samples were obtained from healthy donors from whom written consent had been obtained. Ethics approval was granted by the Seoul National University Hospital Institutional Review Board. All relevant ethical regulations were followed. To isolate neutrophils, 30 ml of normal saline (PBS) was added to every 10 ml of human blood, and 10 ml of Ficoll-Hypaque solution (GE Healthcare) was added from the bottom of the tube, followed by centrifugation at 224g at 20 \u00b0C for 20 min. The bottom layer (red blood cells and neutrophils) was carefully separated and mixed with dextran solution (31392; Sigma) at a 1:1 ratio, inverted 20 times to ensure adequate mixing, and incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 1 h. When clearly layered, the top layer was transferred and centrifuged at 1,100 r.p.m. at 4 \u00b0C for 8 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml PBS, after which 10 ml of 0.2% NaCl solution was added and left for 20 s. The same volume of 1.6% NaCl solution was quickly added and the tube was inverted. After washing twice with cold PBS, the pellet was resuspended in RPMI media containing 3% FBS.\n**HL-60 cell differentiation.**\nThe HL-60 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing l-glutamine (11875; Gibco), 10% FBS and 1X penicillin and streptomycin. To differentiate the cells into the granulocyte lineage, the cells were cultured in 1.3% DMSO for 7 d. Cell characteristic changes were confirmed by flow cytometry to detect surface markers including CD11b and CXCR2.\nFlow cytometry. Samples were pretreated with DMSO or 10 \u00b5M C75 for 3 h and LPS (1 \u00b5g ml -1 ), IL-8 (50 ng ml -1 ) or fMLP (1 \u00b5M) was added to activate neutrophils. As CD11b is reported to be a calcium-dependent epitope, cells (1 \u00d7 10 6 cells per tube) were suspended in FACS buffer with 1% FBS and 0.1% BSA in PBS containing Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ (0.9 mM CaCl 2 and 0.5 mM MgCl 2 (pH 7.4)). After blocking using 1:100 of FcR blocker (130-059-901; Miltenyi Biotec), the cells were incubated with antibodies to CD11b (ICRF44), L-selectin (DREG-56) (all from eBiosciences) or CXCR2 (6C6) (BD Biosciences). For the air pouch models, retrieved cells were washed and incubated with specific antibodies to Ly6G (1A8) or CD11b (M1/70) (both from BD Biosciences) to count neutrophil and monocyte numbers. For human neutrophil apoptosis analysis, an FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit II (556570; BD Biosciences) was used. Appropriate isotype controls were used to exclude nonspecific binding results. Cells were washed three times with FACS buffer and analyzed with a FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences).\nAir pouch mouse model. At the start of the experiment, 5 ml air was injected through a sterile 0.22-\u00b5m filter at the dermal site of a mouse to form an air pouch. On the third day, 2 ml air was injected. On the sixth day, 6 \u03bcl of 10 mM C75 or DMSO was intraperitoneally preinjected and 1% carrageenan (22049-5G-F; Sigma) solution, and 1 ml was injected 4 h later. After the irritants were injected into the pouch, predominant monocytes in the unstimulated pouch exudate were replaced with polymorphonuclear cells during first 24 h. Exudates were harvested 24 h later in 2 ml of sterile saline.\nQuantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) lysis reagent, reverse-transcribed into cDNA by reverse transcriptase (EP0451) and oligo (dT) primers (S0132) (both from Fermentas), and then amplified in a CFX Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems) and specific primers (listed below). Gene expression was normalized to a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase or 18S ribosomal RNA control. Primers used to amplify genes are listed from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 (Supplementary Table 1). The sequence origin was either mouse (m) or human (h).\nNF-\u03baB luciferase reporter assay. hTLR4-293T (2.4 \u00d7 10 4 ) cells were seeded into a clear-bottom 96-well plate (Corning) overnight. Cells were then transfected with 10 ng of pNF-\u03baB luciferase plasmid (pGL3-basic) and 2 ng of pRL-TK (E2241) (both from Promega) using lipofectamine LTX according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 10, 20 or 40 \u03bcM of C75 in 1% BSA DMEM media for 3 h. Next, the cells were treated with 100 ng ml -1 LPS, 1 \u03bcg MYD88, 1 \u03bcg TRAF6, 1 \u03bcg IKBKB or 1 \u03bcg p65 for 6 h. The expression constructs encoding TRAF6, IKBKB and p65 have been described previously 47 . Cells were harvested and assayed using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Reporter System (E2920) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence was measured with a fluorescence detector (Glomax Discover, Promega). For the mutant MYD88 experiment, various mutant hTLR4-MYD88-GyrB-293T stable cells (2 \u00d7 10 4 ) were seeded into the same 96-well plate overnight and followed by the above-stated transfection method. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with 0, 1 or 5 ng coumermycin for 6 h.\nImmunoblotting and co-immunoprecipitation studies. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in 1% NP-40 (Sigma)-containing lysis buffer or RIPA buffer (R0278; Sigma) with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (BioVision) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (93482; Sigma). Lysates were then fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.45-\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Merck Millipore), and probed with antibodies to detect FASN (3180), MYD88 (4283), p-p65 (3033), p-p38 (4511), I\u03baB-\u03b1 (9242), p38 (9212), p65 (8242) (all from Cell Signaling Technology), actin (sc1616; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ZDHHC6 (ab121423), TLR4 (ab13556; both from Abcam) and FLAG (F1804; Sigma). For interaction experiments, hTLR4-293T cell (10 7 ) lysates were incubated for 1 h on ice followed by centrifugation at 13,300 r.p.m. at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. Supernatants then were incubated with 20 \u03bcl FLAG-Gel (A2220; Sigma) for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C. After three washes, immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with TLR4, MYD88 and FLAG. Immunoblot detection was conducted either using a FluorchemM detector (ProteinSimple), Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare) or Automatic Film Processor (Daesung Tech).\nPlasmids. Full-length MYD88 cDNA was cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Addgene) and pKS-GyrB expression plasmids. The pKS-MYD88-GyrB construct was cloned into pcDNA4-V5/His(A), followed by site-directed mutagenesis to generate pcDNA4-V5/His(A)-MYD88-GyrB WT, C113A, C274A, C113/274A, CA and CA113C. The pcDNA3.1-MYD88 construct was cloned into pCMV-tag2A, followed by site-directed mutagenesis to generate FLAG-MYD88 WT, CA, CA113A and E52A. Full-length FASN cDNA was cloned into the pCAG-FLAG-IP vector 48,49 to generate FLAG-FASN. The full-length IRAK4-containing plasmid purchased from Addgene (no. 23749) was cloned into the CAG vector. Deathdomain truncated-MYD88 cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA4-V5/His(A) vector to generate truncated-MYD88 WT, CA and CA113A. ZDHHC6 was cloned into the pCAG-FLAG-IP vector. All clones were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing from Macrogen. ABE assay. HEK-293T cells (10 7 ) were seeded into a 100-mm dish overnight. If transfection was required, the cells were transfected with 10 \u03bcg of MYD88-GyrB plasmid using polyethylenimine (PEI; 23966; Polysciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were harvested using palmitoylation lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Nethylmaleimide (NEM), 1 \u03bcM PMSF (all from Sigma), 200x PIC (Biovision), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl. Lysates were sonicated and incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. These lysates were centrifuged at 13,300 r.p.m. for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatant was subject to chloroform-methanol protein precipitation (4:1:3, methanol:chloroform:water). Pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS buffer and briefly sonicated. Concentrated proteins were treated with 0.5 M hydroxylamine (159417; Sigma) or Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer (negative control) for 2 h at room temperature. The proteins were precipitated following the chloroform-methanol precipitation method, solubilized in 1% SDS and briefly sonicated. Solubilized proteins were diluted by 1/10 to prepare a 0.1% SDS solution and immunoprecipitated with 40 \u03bcl neutravidin agarose (29200; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. Immunoprecipitated beads were washed three times with palmitoylation lysis buffer and eluted with 2x Laemmli sample buffer (S3401; Sigma). Click assay. Click assay was carried out as previously described 50 . First, 10 7 cells were seeded into a 100-mm dish overnight and transfected with 10 \u03bcg of the WT MYD88-GyrB plasmid using PEI according to the manufacturer's protocol. Next, the cells were metabolically labeled with DMSO or 17-ODYA in 1% BSA DMEM media for 7 h. The DMSO-treated group was a negative control, as only samples labeled with 17-ODYA could undergo the click reaction. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 200x PIC. After centrifugation for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatant nature research | reporting summary October 2018\nField-specific reporting Please select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.\n**Life sciences**\nBehavioural & social sciences Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences For a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf\n**Life sciences study design**\nAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.\n**Sample size**\nPilot studies were used to estimate the sample size to analyze with the adequate power. In most of experiments performed, 7-16 mice/group was sufficient to identify statistical differences with at least 80% power and a 5% significance level.\nData exclusions No data was excluded.\n**Replication**\nDifferent biological replicates were performed at defined numbers described in each figure legend. All attempts of replication were successful.\nRandomization No Randomization was performed. The current study used the same sample split into either control or drug treated group. For animal studies, we treated control or drug in syngenic C57BL/6J mice so no randomization methods were considered.\n**Blinding**\nBlinding was not possible in the current study, as samples were analyzed shortly after collection, thus investigators were not blinded to samples.\nReporting for specific materials, systems and methods\nWe require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material, system or method listed is relevant to your study. Recruitment neutrophils from the same person were compared between control vs drug-treated groups, it is less likely that inter-individual biases are minimized in interpreting the results of the study.\n\n\nToll-like receptor (TLR)/myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MYD88) signaling aggravates sepsis by impairing neutrophil migration to infection sites. However, the role of intracellular fatty acids in TLR/MYD88 signaling is unclear. Here, inhibition of fatty acid synthase by C75 improved neutrophil chemotaxis and increased the survival of mice with sepsis in cecal ligation puncture and lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock models. C75 specifically blocked TLR/MYD88 signaling in neutrophils. Treatment with GSK2194069 that targets a different domain of fatty acid synthase, did not block TLR signaling or MYD88 palmitoylation. De novo fatty acid synthesis and CD36-mediated exogenous fatty acid incorporation contributed to MYD88 palmitoylation. The binding of IRAK4 to the MYD88 intermediate domain and downstream signal activation required MYD88 palmitoylation at cysteine 113. MYD88 was palmitoylated by ZDHHC6, and ZDHHC6 knockdown decreased MYD88 palmitoylation and TLR/MYD88 activation upon lipopolysaccharide stimulus. Thus, intracellular saturated fatty aciddependent palmitoylation of MYD88 by ZDHHC6 is a therapeutic target of sepsis.\n\n",
