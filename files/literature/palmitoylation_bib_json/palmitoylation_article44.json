    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, protein S-acylation (often referred to as S-palmitoylation) has emerged as an important regulator of vital signalling pathways. S-Acylation is a reversible post-translational modification that involves the attachment of a fatty acid to a protein. Maintenance of the equilibrium between protein S-acylation and deacylation has demonstrated profound effects on various cellular processes, including innate immunity, inflammation, glucose metabolism and fat metabolism, as well as on brain and heart function. This Review provides an overview of current understanding of S-acylation and deacylation enzymes, their spatiotemporal regulation by sophisticated multilayered mechanisms, and their influence on protein function, cellular processes and physiological pathways. Furthermore, we examine how disruptions in protein S-acylation are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases from cancer to autoinflammatory disorders and neurological conditions.\n",

These enzymes consist of at least four transmembrane domains 30 with the DHHC cysteine-rich domain exposed to the cytoplasm between transmembrane domains 2 and 3 (refs. 30-33) (Fig. 1c). The Z in ZDHHC (zDHHC in the mouse) designates two zinc-binding motifs in the cysteine-rich domain 34 . Other conserved sequences are aspartate-proline-glycine (DPG), threonine-threonine-x-glutamic acid (TTxE) and a palmitoyltransferase conserved carboxy-terminal (PaCCT) motif 32,33,35 . However, ZDHHCs diverge considerably in their amino and C termini, both in length and sequence, and some also harbour other well-defined protein domains, such as ankyrin repeats (ZDHHC13 and ZDHHC17) 36 , SH3 domains (ZDHHC6) 37 or PDZ-binding motifs (for example, ZDHHC5 and ZDHHC8) 38,39 .\nThe catalytic process involves two sequential steps. Initially, the DHHC cysteine within the active site undergoes acylation, a process termed auto-acylation, through reaction with an acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) donor that binds to a CoA-binding surface on the cytosolic face of the ZDHHC 40 . Subsequently, this acyl chain is transferred from the DHHC cysteine to a cysteine on the target protein 41 . The crystal structures of human ZDHHC20 and zebrafish ZDHHC15 reveal that the four transmembrane domains form a lengthy cavity containing hydrophobic residues that are likely to govern the selection of acyl chain length 31 (Fig. 1d). Positioned at the entrance of this acyl-binding cavity is the active-site cysteine, presumably to facilitate engagement of the acyl-CoA substrate leading to auto-acylation.\n**Subcellular localization**\nGiven the large diversity of S-acylation substrates, perhaps it is not surprising that each individual cell type or tissue expresses many (or even most) ZDHHC family members [42][43][44] , albeit with tissue-specific enrichment of some enzymes (Box 1). Quantitative proteomics has revealed that individual ZDHHC proteins are present in low abundance relative to that of other enzymes that catalyse lipid modifications. Two studies that analysed 9 and 17 different ZDHHCs, respectively, in HeLa cells 45,46 reported ZDHHC copy numbers ranging from hundreds for ZDHHC12 to ~5,000 for ZDHHC6 and 15,000-60,000 for ZDHHC5. Even combined, however, the total ZDHHC copy number (43,000-110,000) was still substantially lower than that for N-myristoyltransferase 1 alone (225,000) 45 . This observation suggests that ZDHHC enzymes must be very active and therefore require a high level of control. Low enzyme abundance might also favour specificity.\n\n**Introduction**\nFor cells to function adequately in a context-dependent manner, the contributions of each protein molecule must be tightly controlled in both time and space. Such fine-tuning is ensured by enzymes that locally and temporally modify the physical and chemical properties of proteins, thereby affecting their function. Some 400 different types of post-translational modifications have been reported [1][2][3] . Among these, lipidation confers hydrophobicity on proteins and, consequently, drives their association with membranes and even with specific membrane subdomains [4][5][6] . Therefore, lipid modifications are essential for the compartmentalized organization of eukaryotic cells and for enabling these compartments to work together in a coordinated manner. Membrane-bound organelles enable the spatial separation of biochemically incompatible processes. In addition, they offer active, dynamic and spatially restricted membrane surfaces that act as assembly platforms for various cellular processes 7 and provide access routes, via vesicular trafficking, to other subcellular locations 7,8 .\nLipid modifications include several forms of fatty acylation: N-myristoylation, N-acylation, O-acylation and S-acylation 5,6 . These modifications can be differentiated by the amino acid (glycine, lysine, serine or cysteine) on which the modification occurs, the enzymatic reaction involved, the reversibility of the modification and the type of lipid chain to be attached (saturated or unsaturated, short-chain or long-chain; for example, palmitic (C16) or stearic (C18) acids) [4][5][6] .\nS-Acylation is reversible by deacylation and, consequently, can act as a dynamic on/off switch, similar to phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation. As palmitic acid is the most frequently added lipid 9 , S-acylation has often been referred to as S-palmitoylation or palmitoylation, even when the specific lipid has not been identified. This post-translational modification is extremely common and could, potentially, affect 10-20% of the human proteome (Box 1). S-Acylation and deacylation cycles consistently influence or control many cellular and physiological processes, including signalling, cell migration and division, inter-organelle and inter-cell communication, energy metabolism, innate immunity and tissue function 4,6,[10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20] . As a consequence, alterations in S-acylation and deacylation dynamics are increasingly found to be associated with a range of human disorders, from metabolic to inflammatory diseases, neurodegeneration and cancer 10,[16][17][18][20][21][22] .\nDespite being discovered more than 40 years ago, we stand at the threshold of a new era of growing research interest in S-acylation. This Review describes the structures, functions and regulation of S-acylation and deacylation enzymes. We use specific examples to explore the protein-level implications of S-acylation, the influence of this modification on cellular pathways and its effects on physiological and disease processes. Although we mainly focus on mammals, S-acylation is of crucial importance in all eukaryotic organisms and their pathogens, particularly viruses (Supplementary Box 1). Promising prospects offered by the therapeutic applications of targeting S-acetylation and deacylation enzymes are also discussed.\n**S-Acyltransferases**\nS-Acylation involves the attachment of medium-chain or long-chain fatty acids to specific cytosolic cysteine residues within proteins 9,23 . This modification is mediated by a family of S-acyltransferases that contain a conserved aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine (DHHC) cysteine-rich domain first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 24 and confirmed by biochemical reconstitution of enzymatic activity [25][26][27] .\n**Review article**\ndensities at the plasma membrane of dendritic spines. Once there, ZDHHC2 modifies post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), which leads to increased recruitment of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors 56 . Conversely, in response to neuronal activity, ZDHHC5 on synaptic membranes is transported to dendritic shafts where it acylates \u03b4-catenin 57 . Together, ZDHHC5 and \u03b4-catenin are then mobilized in recycling endosomes and shuttled back into synapses 57 . These studies underscore the integration of spatial regulation of ZDHHC proteins into cellular responses.\n**Lipid and protein substrate specificity**\nZDHHCs have two levels of specificity: the acyl chain they add and the protein(s) to which it is added. The maximal length and, potentially, also saturation of the acyl chain are determined by the architecture and amino acid composition of the hydrophobic cavity within the tepee structure of ZDHHC enzymes, particularly the interactions with and the size of a pair of residues (Ser29 and Tyr181 for ZDHHC20) present at the end of the lipid-binding cavity 31,32,58,59 (Fig. 1d). Except for viral glycoproteins (Supplementary Box 1), the identity of the acyl chain attached to a protein by ZDHHCs has rarely been determined 60,61 .\n**Box 1**\n**Protein S-acylation bioinformatic tools**\nSeveral online databases facilitate the study of protein S-acylation. SwissPalm provides a catalogue of S-acylated proteins and some analysis tools; RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data on genes that regulate S-acylation are provided for the brain by BrainPalmSeq and for various human single cells and bulk RNA-seq by CellPalmSeq.\n**SwissPalm**\nThis centralized multi-species database catalogues all reported S-acylation substrates and is composed of curated proteome data sets and experimental validation data from the literature. SwissPalm provides a tool to search for any given protein and returns a summary of the number of times this protein has been identified in an acyl-proteome data set or validated experimentally. Currently, close to 25% of the human proteome appears at least once in reported acyl-proteomes. Mass spectrometry has a substantial statistical false discovery rate, however, and hydroxylamine-dependent capture of proteins in addition generates a level of background detection (Box 2). Validation of S-acylation by other methods (Box 2) and determination of the biological relevance of the acylation have so far only been performed for a limited number of proteins. However, we can safely conclude that S-acylation is a very common post-translational modification, the precise extent of which remains to be determined. Moreover, proteomics studies do not directly confirm the S-acylation of all hits. In the search output for each protein, SwissPalm provides S-acylation site prediction data using PalmPred and CSS-Palm tools 264,265 . Additional tools facilitate the rapid comparison of large protein lists with the SwissPalm database and offer many modular layers of filtering (including by species and by the curated SwissPalm evidence for a protein being an S-acylation substrate). Knowledge of whether a protein or group of proteins are substrates for S-acylation is extremely useful when trying to understand how S-acylation might alter any given biological pathway. The SwissPalm proteome comparison tool enables rapid identification of S-acylation substates included within large data sets and protein lists, which can then be assessed to determine the percentage of S-acylation substrates within the list. Identified substrates can be analysed using other bioinformatic ontology-based tools, such as STRING and Gene Ontology (GO).\n**BrainPalmSeq**\nThis curated online database of RNA-seq data covers the genes that regulate S-acylation in the brain, including the zinc-finger and aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine (DHHC) motif-containing (ZDHHC) enzymes, the best-characterized deacylation enzymes and known ZDHHC accessory proteins. The tool was created by collating expression data from numerous previously published single-cell and bulk RNA-seq studies, reanalysing the data using the same analysis pipeline for all data sets, and summarizing the data in standardized, easy-to-use, interactive heatmaps. The relative expression of each S-acylation-associated gene can either be summarized across all cell types or brain regions in a selection of data sets or searched within individual data sets according to brain region or cell type. Drop-down menus can be used to highlight and compare the expression of genes that regulate S-acylation in selected cell types. This tool can be used to identify which specific ZDHHC and deacylation enzymes are likely to have the most influence over protein S-acylation in different cellular contexts in the brain, which is composed of hundreds of unique and highly divergent cell types. BrainPalmSeq can also be used to investigate how the expression patterns of disease-linked genes that regulate S-acylation might relate to disease aetiology and to predict enzyme-substrate interactions for S-acylation substates in specific cell types.\n**CellPalmSeq**\nThis database parallels BrainPalmSeq but covers human single-cell and bulk RNA-seq data derived from hundreds of cancer cell lines that are a mainstay of biological and cancer research as well as commonly used non-human cell lines. The relative expression patterns of genes that regulate S-acylation can be quickly compared using interactive heatmaps organized by dataset. Bar charts also enable the comparison of the expression of each individual gene across many tissues and cell types in the human body, or in cancer cell lines with a similar origin. This tool is particularly useful for researchers and cell biologists who use immortalized cell lines to investigate S-acylation-regulated processes, including in vaccine development, drug toxicity research, protein production and studies of gene function. Given the well-established role of tumour-promoting protein S-acylation in cancer progression, this tool can enable cancer researchers to determine which S-acylation and deacylation enzymes are enriched in cancer cell lines and how these enzymes might be targeted for cancer therapies. A target protein of interest is acylated at the thiol of a target cysteine residue by zinc-finger and aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine (DHHC) motif-containing (ZDHHC) enzymes, which use acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) molecules (such as palmitoyl-CoA, shown) as an acyl donor. The thioestertethered lipid modification can be removed through hydrolysis mediated by deacylation enzymes such as acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs). ZDHHC and APT inhibitors, as well as imaging probes, enable the perturbation and study of this dynamic regulatory process. b, Phylogenetic tree of ZDHHC S-acyltransferases. The 23 human ZDHHCs are categorized into subfamilies on the basis of their full-length amino acid sequences. c, Core membrane topology and conserved sequence motifs. ZDHHC proteins contain at least four transmembrane domains. The conserved DHHC cysteine-rich domain (green) includes the canonical DHHC motif (magenta) situated on the cytoplasmic face of the lipid bilayer. Additional conserved features include an aspartic acid-proline-glycine (DPG) motif of unknown function that lies adjacent to transmembrane domain 2 on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (yellow); a threonine-threonine-xglutamic acid (TTxE) motif that interacts with the catalytic DHHC and is required for robust enzymatic activity 31 (red); and a palmitoyltransferase conserved carboxy-terminal (PaCCT) motif, part of an amphipathic helix that interacts with transmembrane domains 3 and 4 and contributes to stabilization of the C-terminal domain 31 (blue). In a subset of ZDHHCs, cysteine residues within the PaCCT motif are S-acylated 70,71,77 . d, Structures of ZDHHC20 (Protein Database (PDB) entry [PDB:6BML]) 31 and the ZDHHC9-golgin subfamily A (GOLGA) member 7 (GCP16) heterodimer [PDB:8HF3] 73 . The four transmembrane domain helices in ZDHHC20 and ZDHHC9 (blue) form a tepee-like cavity into which the acyl chain of the acyl-CoA co-substrate is inserted. Cytoplasmic regions flanking the green DHHC cysteine-rich domain are shown in white. Two zinc ions (brown spheres) are positioned between \u03b2-hairpins, each coordinated by three cysteines and a histidine. The zinc ions do not coordinate the active-site cysteine in the DHHC motif and are not involved in catalysis but, rather, serve a structural role 31 . In the ZDHHC9-GCP16 complex 73 , GCP16 (red) lacks a transmembrane domain but has two \u03b1-helices that insert into the membrane and interact with transmembrane domains 2 and 3. The position of these helices is analogous to that of the hydrophobic loop in ZDHHC20 (red-loop), which stabilizes the structure to fully support enzyme activity 31 . The hydrophobic loop of GCP16 probably fulfils a similar function and might partly account for the requirement of ZDHHC9 for an accessory protein. Three additional interfaces drive the main interactions of GCP16 and ZDHHC9: two involve the zinc-finger motifs and the third contacts a polyproline helix near the end of the cytoplasmic domain. Together, these interactions stabilize the structure of ZDHHC9 and promote its catalytic activity. CMA, cyano-myracrylamide.\n**Review article**\n**Review article**\nTherefore, although some ZDHHC enzymes might have the ability to add various lengths of acyl chains 23 , it is unclear whether they actually do so, whether acyl chain length is controlled and what the consequences of varying the acyl chain length might be.\nDefining substrate selectivity rules for ZDHHC proteins is an ongoing challenge. Some enzymes (such as ZDHHC17) seem to be very selective 62 , whereas others, such as ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC7, are fairly promiscuous 39,48,63,64 . Subcellular protein distribution provides a first level of specificity because it dictates where enzymes and substrates can interact. ZDHHC substrate specificity could arise also from the divergent N and C termini. For example, ZDHHC17 and ZDHHC13 harbour ankyrin repeat domains that bind to a short linear sequence motif in their respective substrates. The ankyrin repeat of ZDHHC17 binds to a short peptide in SNAP25 (synaptosomal-associated protein 25, a target (t) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)) and in huntingtin, a key ZDHHC17 target 62,65 . However, ankyrin-independent binding has also been reported 36,66 . Other ZDHHCs, such as ZDHHC5, ZDHHC8 and ZDHHC14, bear PDZ-binding motif domains. For example, a PDZ-binding motif in ZDHHC5 facilitates its binding to the neuronal scaffold protein PSD95 (refs. 39,67). Substrate recognition might also occur within the membrane: as an example, ZDHHC6 recognizes both type I and type II transmembrane domain proteins as substrates, and S-acylation by ZDHHC6 seems to require only a juxtamembranous cysteine residue 68 , a feature that is consistent across all validated ZDHHC6 substrates 37,42,50,69 . Emerging evidence suggests that even low-affinity interactions between ZDHHC proteins and target peptide sequences can display striking selectivity. S-Acylation of the G protein \u03b1-subunit (G\u03b1 o ) is dependent only on a short N-myristoylated sequence. When the N-terminal peptide of G\u03b1 o was appended to green fluorescent protein, minor changes in the amino acid sequence could change it from a substrate for ZDHHC3 localized at the Golgi to a substrate for ZDHHC11 localized at the plasma membrane 55 .\n**ZDHHC regulation**\nThe mechanisms that regulate the activity of ZDHHC enzymes are only now starting to be understood. These mechanisms include transcriptional regulation, post-translational modification and interaction with accessory proteins. Of note, cells can also regulate the abundance of fatty acids, which influences the ability of ZDHHCs to modify their substrates.\nAccessory proteins. Most ZDHHCs function as homomeric enzymes. However, a subset of ZDHHCs can form heterodimers with an accessory protein 70 . The founding acyltransferase, yeast Erf2, requires association with accessory protein Erf4 for enzyme activity and protein stability 25 . The mammalian counterpart of Erf4, GOLGA7 (also known as GCP16), associates with ZDHHC9, ZDHHC14 and ZDHHC18 (refs. 71,72). GOLGA proteins are present in the Golgi and thought to be involved in the formation and function of the Golgi apparatus. Both yeast Erf4 and GOLGA7 stabilize the structure of the heterodimers, and thereby enable the ZDHHC protein to adopt a conformation that is capable of efficient catalysis. Published cryo-electron micrography structures of ZDHHC9-GOLGA7 and yeast Erf2-Erf4 heterodimers reveal a conserved binding mode mediated by interactions at four main interfaces 73 (Fig. 1e). Neither GOLGA7 nor Erf4 seems to play a direct role in the catalytic mechanism or in substrate recognition. ZDHHC5 also associates with GOLGA7 and the related accessory protein GOLGA7B (refs. 74,75), which suggests that heterodimer formation extends to other ZDHHC9 subfamily members (Fig. 1b). However, GOLGA7 and GOLGA7B are probably not necessary for ZDHHC5 function, given that binding of ZDHHC5 to the sodium pump and to GOLGA7B occurs at overlapping sites in its C-terminal domain 76 .\nPost-translational modifications. Phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and S-acylation are prominent post-translational modifications of ZDHHCs that have consequences for their enzyme activity, proteinprotein interactions, localization and protein stability 77,78 . The mechanisms that underlie the installation and removal of post-translational modifications in ZDHHCs, and the functional sequelae of these events, are only beginning to be uncovered 37,79,80 .\nIncreased synaptic activity leads to the sequential phosphorylation of ZDHHC5 (mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and polo-like kinase 2, respectively) on two serine residues within its polo-box domain 80 . Dual phosphorylation leads to ZDHHC5 degradation, presumably by enabling its ubiquitylation 80 . By contrast, phosphorylation of ZDHHC13 leads to increased binding to and S-acylation of its substrate, melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R). S-Acylation of MC1R results in increased signalling to its downstream effectors, a process that prevents melanoma carcinogenesis 79,81 .\nMany ZDHHC enzymes also undergo regulatory S-acylation at locations outside the active-site cysteine, which can be monitored using various methods (Box 2). The mechanism of regulatory S-acylation was initially proposed to be intramolecular transfer of the acyl chain from the active site to distal cysteines 82 but we now appreciate that ZDHHC proteins participate in S-acyltransferase cascades in a manner analogous to those involving protein kinases. For example, ZDHHC6 is S-acylated by ZDHHC16 at three cysteine residues within its C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Reversible S-acylation at these sites is finely tuned and results in site-specific regulation of ZDHHC6 enzyme activity and stability 37 . ZDHHC5 is S-acylated within its C-terminal PaCCT motif by ZDHHC20 at cysteines that mediate the interaction of ZDHHC5 with GOLGA7B (ref. 75) and facilitate substrate recruitment 76 . Conservation of S-acylation at cysteines within or adjacent to the PaCCT motif in other ZDHHC proteins is supported by mass spectrometry data 83 , which suggests that additional S-acyltransferase cascades remain to be identified.\n**Transcriptional regulation.**\nStudies of S-acylation of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus revealed that it is S-acylated by ZDHHC20 (refs. 52,84) and that ZDHHCs might undergo transcriptional regulation 85 . In response to infection with SARS-CoV-2, extended transcripts of ZDHHC20 are generated from a transcriptional start site upstream of the canonical site, which results in an enzyme with an N-terminal extension. This long isoform is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (as opposed to the Golgi localization of canonical ZDHHC20). Retention leads to greatly enhanced S-acylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein following its synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and viral budding in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment. Viruses carrying S-acylated spike proteins have increased fusogenic capacity during infection.\n**Inhibitors**\nFew small molecule inhibitors of ZDHHC enzymes are known 86 (Table 1). For decades, the gold-standard ZDHHC inhibitor was 2-bromopalmitate, which covalently binds to the ZDHHC active-site cysteine and effectively inhibits enzymatic activity 87 . However, this agent has numerous off-target effects 88 and also interferes with deacylation Review article enzymes 48,89 , which introduces complexity by disrupting the delicate equilibrium between lipid installation and removal in unpredictable ways. Development of cyano-myracrylamide (CMA), a covalent ZDHHC inhibitor with improved selectivity 90,91 , facilitated investigation of the dynamic lipidation of ERK1 and ERK2 (ref. 92). However, the search for new potent and highly selective ZDHHC inhibitors has proven extremely challenging. Screens yielded either agents with no notable activity 93 or moderately potent, non-covalent inhibitors 94 . An orthogonal ligand-enzyme genetic strategy that relies on using a mutation to make a small cavity in the structure of the enzyme that can be filled by a ligand with a corresponding pump (known as a 'bumped' lipid probe) and its corresponding mutant ZDHHC enzyme pair enables targeted substrate examination and inhibition of ZDHHCs. This technique provides a valuable approach to map ZDHHC substrate and function connectivity 58,59 at locations outside the active-site cysteine.\n**Deacylation enzymes**\nS-Acylation is reversed by deacylation enzymes of the metabolic serine hydrolase superfamily. These enzymes use a conserved catalytic serine for nucleophilic attack on a target electrophile, which in protein S-acylation is the thioester carbonyl group. The resultant ester intermediate is hydrolysed by water, thereby regenerating the enzyme in a simple catalytic mechanism.\nThe current known deacylation enzymes include acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1) and APT2 (also known as LYPLA1 and LYPLA2, respectively); palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1); and \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase\n**Box 2**\n**Techniques for studying protein S-acylation**\nVarious methods have been developed to study S-acylation, each having its advantages and each providing somewhat different information (illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1). To determine whether a protein can be S-acylated, on which site and with what stoichiometry, we recommend using multiple methods. Acyl-biotin exchange (ABE), acyl resin-assisted capture (acyl-RAC) and metabolic labelling reveal whether a protein can be acylated. Use of hydroxylamine controls ensures that the detected signals are due to thioester linkages to cysteines. Cysteine mutagenesis can be used for confirmation and site identification. Mass spectrometry can determine which fatty acid has been attached to which cysteine 61,266,267 . Often, however, such precise identification is not feasible owing to limited sample amounts, the difficulty of isolating lipidated proteins (particularly transmembrane proteins) and the inherent lability of the thioester modification. Identification of the involved zinc-finger and aspartate-histidine-histidinecysteine (DHHC) motif-containing (ZDHHC) enzyme strengthens conclusions about the S-acylation status of a protein. Finally, stochiometric information can be obtained by acyl-polyethylene glycol exchange, which involves the covalent attachment of one PEG molecule (PEGylation) to each acyl-modified cysteine residue.\n**ABE and acyl-RAC**\nThese methods involve protecting all unmodified cysteines in the proteome, followed by selective exposure of the thioester-modified cysteines to the intervention and enrichment based on the presence of those cysteines. Cysteine modification via S-acylation is indicated by the unique chemical reactivity of the thioester to hydroxylamine-mediated hydrolysis. ABE and acyl-RAC offer the advantage of enabling downstream proteomic analysis of the entire population of S-acylated proteins in the sample analysed, which provides a snapshot of the acylated proteome. The disadvantages of these methods are that the identity of the specific thioester modification (that is, S-acylation versus other thioester modifications) is not determined, nor is stoichiometry, as it is an enrichment-based approach.\n**Cysteine PEGylation**\nCysteine PEGylation is a derivative of the ABE and acyl-RAC assays, except that rather than tagging the thioester-modified proteome sites with an affinity handle, the sites are mass-tagged with a long PEG molecule. Western blot analysis can then be used to elucidate the approximate stoichiometry of the modified sites by comparing the relative signals of the unmodified and modified band(s) in the gel. Disadvantages are the same as those for ABE and acyl-RAC assays, most notably that this method does not determine the type of thioester modification.\n**Metabolic labelling**\nIncorporation of either radiolabelled or clickable lipids, followed by analysis using either gel electophoresis (for radiolabelling) or click chemistry, followed by enrichment (for clickable lipids) provides a crucial set of orthogonal information. These methods provide some information about lipid identity, determined by which lipids are incorporated or not, and they distinguish fatty acids linked to proteins from other types of cysteine thioesters, such as ubiquitin. Some caution must be taken with clickable lipids, which are synthetic surrogates of the natural lipid substrate. Thus, although such studies are qualitatively useful for determining the preferred acyl chain length, they are not conclusive. A unique advantage of metabolic labelling methods is that they can provide information about dynamic changes in protein S-acylation over time (by using different times of labelling with radiolabelled or clickable lipids), as well as the turnover rate of the acyl chain (in pulse-chase experiments). Therefore, metabolic labelling methods provide invaluable information on the dynamics of acylation-deacylation cycles 28,266 . Advantages include the amenability of metabolic labelling with clickable lipids to downstream proteomic analysis. Disadvantages include the fact that this method is not inherently selective for thioester-based proteome modifications. However, the addition of a control to distinguish which modifications are sensitive to hydroxylamine deprotection can be employed to indicate S-acylation sites. Also, these methods inform only about proteins that were modified during the labelling period, and do not provide a snapshot of the acylated proteome (unlike ABE and acyl-RAC).\n**Review article**\ndomain-containing protein 10 (ABHD10), ABHD17A, ABHD17B and ABHD17C (refs. 4,95,96). Structures have been solved for PPT1 (ref. 97), APT1 and APT2 (refs. 98,99), and ABHD10 (ref. 100). The active sites of these enzymes contain a Ser, His and Asp catalytic triad with confirmed deacylating activity for various substrates in vitro (APT1, APT2, PPT1 and ABDH10) and/or sensitivity to deacylation inhibitors and activity-based probes (ABHD6, ABHD12, ABHD13, ABHD16A, ABHD17A, ABHD17B and ABHD17C) 28,96,98,[101][102][103] . Lysophospholipase activity has also been reported for APT1, APT2, ABHD6, ABHD12 and ABHD16A (refs. 104-106).\nA comprehensive view of deacylation is now surfacing. To access their targets, acyl-thioesterases must first bind to cell membranes. Membrane binding is an important regulatory event that does not involve recognized lipid-interacting motifs (as shown for APT1 and APT2) but, instead, relies on electrostatic interactions with positively charged residues in cooperation with the membrane insertion of a hydrophobic loop, the so-called \u03b2-tongue 48 . Subsequently, stable membrane association is mediated by S-acylation of APTs and ABHD17A, ABHD17B and ABHD17C (ref. 107), which are otherwise soluble proteins. Intriguingly, structural predictions suggest that ABHD16A has four transmembrane regions 108 . By contrast, once APT1 and APT2 achieve stable association with a membrane, these deacylation enzymes must extract the acyl chain attached to their substrate from the membrane and position it in a hydrophobic pocket, which enables correct positioning of the thioester bond at the active site 48 .\n**Localization**\nThioesterases that have regulatory roles in S-acylation and deacylation cycles must necessarily reside in the cytosol, as the location of ZDHHC enzyme activity (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, in terms of copy numbers per cell, the thioesterases are each 10-100 times more abundant than the ZDHHC enzymes 45,46 , probably to ensure that the changes induced by S-acylation can be efficiently terminated when necessary. Bone disorders: osteoporosis, bone malformations, dysregulation of osteogenic differentiation\n**Table 1 | Associations between protein S-acylating or deacylation enzymes and disease or physiological processes**\nCancers: skin, breast, colon, ovarian, prostate, lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, bladder, bone, glaucoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, glioblastoma\nMental disorders: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, memory and learning deficits, behavioural deficits, hyperactivity, visual and cognitive deficits, epilepsy, autism, depression, psychosis Illustrative examples for which the activity a , expression level b or mutations c of zinc-finger and aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine (DHHC) motif-containing (ZDHHC) and acyl-protein thioesterase (APT) enzymes or their specific S-acylated substrates d have been linked with disorders and physiological processes in various models.

Importantly, deacylation enzymes are found in other subcellular locations; however, such enzymes cannot contribute to regulation of S-acylation and deacylation cycles.\nOnly one non-regulatory deacylation enzyme is known to be involved in the lysosomal degradation of S-acylated proteins, namely PPT1. Mutations in PPT1 are associated with the devastating neurodegenerative disease neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 1 (CLN1) 110 (Table 1). PPT1 is consistently abundant (500,000-1,000,000 copies per cell 4,45,46 ) inside late endosomes and/or lysosomes, and this localization is driven by its N-terminal signal sequence and by mannose-6-phosphate modification in the Golgi, even though a cytosolic presence of PPT1 has also been reported 4 . APT1 and ABHD10 primarily localize to mitochondria, as revealed by activity-based imaging and subcellular fractionation 100,109 . The role of APT1 in mitochondria remains to be established, although a proteomic study in mice with liver-specific double-knockout of APT1 and APT2 confirmed the abundance of mitochondrial APT1 substrates. APT1 activity was further linked to a role in glucose metabolism in mice fed a high-fat diet, a phenotype exacerbated in mice with liver-specific double-knockout of APT1 and APT2 (ref. 111). ABDH10 seems to be involved in regulation of mitochondrial redox homeostasis 100 .\nAlthough the regulatory deacylation enzymes are topologically cytosolic, they accumulate via their own S-acylation on specific membranes -the Golgi for APT2 (refs. 48,112,113) and the plasma membrane for ABHD17A-ABHD17C (refs. 101-103). When non-acylated, localization of these enzymes is determined by diffusion, whereas localization of their S-acetylated forms is driven by vesicular transport. Moreover, these cytosolic thioesterases undergo dynamic acylationdeacylation cycles. For example, APT2 on the Golgi is S-acylated by ZDHHC3, whereas APT2 on the endoplasmic reticulum is S-acylated by ZDHHC7 (ref. 48), thereby enabling APT2 to potentially be trafficked to the Golgi by vesicular transport. Accumulation of APT2 at the Golgi indicates that it undergoes slow vesicular transport out of this compartment and slow release by deacylation. Slow transport to the plasma membrane, where some APT2 targets reside, does indeed occur 112 . At the plasma membrane surface, APT2 is thought to undergo deacylation by an as yet unidentified thioesterase to reinitiate the trafficking cycle 4,112 . Understanding how APTs and ABHDs reach different endomembranes to access their substrates requires further investigation.\n**Regulation and specificity**\nOnly few regulatory features of APT activity are known. In cells, APT2 activity requires stable association with a membrane, which requires S-acylation of APT2 near its N terminus 48 . In the membrane-bound state, APT2 inserts a hydrophobic loop, the \u03b2-tongue, into the lipid bilayer. This event masks a lysine residue in APT2 that in the unbound state undergoes ubiquitylation, thereby targeting APT2 for proteasomal degradation 48 . Therefore, S-acylation and ubiquitylation control the APT2 pool size as well as its localization and activity. Cytosolic APT1 also undergoes S-acylation 112 . In addition, activation of WNT5A signalling induces phosphorylation of two exposed serine residues, which enhances the activity of APT1 and promotes metastatic behaviour of tumour cells 114 . Mutation of one of these serines is frequent in human melanoma and is associated with high tumour grade.\nDeacylation enzymes possess unique structural features around their active sites that enable isoform-specific inhibition despite the similarity of their acyl-binding elements 98 . Sequence elements in their protein substrates, particularly residues adjacent to the acylated cysteine(s), also influence deacylase specificity 115 . Non-redundancy among deacylation enzymes is emphasized by their distinct cellular and tissue expression patterns 116 and specific substrates 101 . For example, ABHD17A can deacylate both GTPase N-Ras and PSD95, which APT1 and APT2 are unable to modify [101][102][103] . APT1 and APT2 display mostly specific substrates 115 , although some studies report that they can have compensatory roles 111,117 .\n**Inhibitors and activity probes**\nIn contrast to the paucity of ZDHHC inhibitors, numerous small mole cules are available for both inhibiting and monitoring thioesterases in living systems. Among these, the most frequently utilized is palmostatin B 118 , a pan-deacylation enzyme covalent inhibitor. Isoform-selective inhibitors are also available that can target APT1 (ML348) 119 , APT2 (ML349) 98,120 and the three ABHD17 enzymes (the covalent inhibitor AB957) 103 . A lipid-based covalent inhibitor that localizes to mitochondria (mitoFP) led to the identification of ABHD10 (ref. 100). Real-time deacylation enzyme activity can be monitored within live cells, for example using inducible fluorescent depalmitoylation probes 100,114,[121][122][123][124][125] . Studies using such sensing probes 126 have revealed that the activity levels of deacylation enzymes are not static but, rather, respond dynamically to signalling events such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation 121 , Wnt signalling 114 , tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signalling 124 , hyperglycaemia 122 , palmitate stress 109 and redox stress 100 . Therefore, the deacylation enzymes themselves seem to be regulated by and able to respond dynamically to cellular cues.\n**Effects of S-acylation on proteins**\nAt the individual protein level, the direct effects of S-acylation are arguably limited to two often-interlinked primary outcomes: association with specific membrane domains (Fig. 2a) and alterations in local protein structure (Fig. 2b). These elements can instigate several types of secondary and tertiary effects, including relocation to membrane structures with a distinct curvature or thickness (Fig. 2c); binding to or separation from other membrane or peripheral proteins (Fig. 2d); and alterations to the protein's activity (Fig. 2h). In turn, these changes could, collectively or individually, lead to a non-exhaustive range of tertiary consequences that are often, again, interconnected: vesicular trafficking to specific locations in the endomembrane system, such as the plasma membrane or lysosomes (Fig. 2e); the establishment of protein complexes and signalling platforms (Fig. 2f,g); changes in protein activity and/or function (Fig. 2h); and interaction with other post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitylation and phosphorylation (Fig. 2i).\n**Membrane nanodomains**\nS-Acylation of soluble proteins causes them to bind to membranes (Fig. 2a). It is important to note that these proteins generally require an additional mechanism for membrane interaction, which brings them close to the ZDHHC catalytic sites. This mechanism can be a membrane-interacting sequence or another form of lipidation, such as myristoylation 127,128 . However, many reported S-acylation substrates are transmembrane proteins 4,15 . When acylation occurs on a cytosolic domain, this domain is brought to the membrane, similar to the acylation of soluble proteins 48 (Fig. 2a,b). Acylation sites often reside very close to transmembrane domains 15,42 (Fig. 2a,b), sometimes even within them. The addition of the saturated acyl chain influences the\n**Review article**\naffinity of the transmembrane region for specific lipids, particularly ones that form ordered phases, such as cholesterol, sphingolipids and phospholipids with long saturated acyl chains [129][130][131] .\nProteins that have a high number of S-acylated cysteines near the membrane -such as the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which forms trimers and carries ten acylation sites per protomer -could potentially induce the de novo formation of membrane nanodomains (rather than simply associating with pre-existing ones) through a phase-separation mechanism 52 . Therefore, S-acylation ensures the association of a protein with specific nanodomains within a membrane. This specificity guarantees the precise spatial control of mediated events and a high local concentration of the required components, including signalling lipids.\n**Protein conformation**\nS-Acylation, similar to other protein modifications, can directly or indirectly induce conformational changes (Fig. 2b) that potentially alter the activity of the target protein. For instance, S-acylation can modulate the opening and closing of membrane channels [131][132][133][134][135] (Fig. 2h).\nVarious subtypes of voltage-gated sodium (Na V ) channels can undergo S-acylation on two or more cysteines in an intracellular loop, which leads to functional changes in their gating kinetics 132 . In cardiac Na V 1.5 channels, for example, mutation of one of the four putative S-acylation sites affects both voltage dependence and channel inactivation; these changes have been linked to cardiac arrhythmia 133 . Similar alterations in voltage sensitivity and tarantula toxin reactivity are observed in Na V 1.2 channels with mutations in S-acylation sites 134 , which suggests that S-acylation-induced conformational changes also influence regions beyond the voltage-sensing domain.\nS-Acylation can also tilt transmembrane domains 136,137 , such as those of the Wnt co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, LRP6 folds and then moves to the Golgi and, ultimately, the cell surface. The transmembrane domain length of LRP6 is a good match for the plasma membrane thickness but is too long for the thinner endoplasmic reticulum membrane. S-Acylation-induced transmembrane domain tilting compensates for this hydrophobic mismatch 137 . In addition to preventing premature targeting to the endoplasmic \n**Review article**\nreticulum-associated degradation pathway, such mechanisms could potentially enable S-acylation to play a crucial role in the biogenesis of transmembrane proteins 15 .\n**Subcellular protein localization**\nS-Acylation-induced alterations in the physical and chemical properties of proteins might lead to their movement into membrane regions with different thicknesses and/or curvatures, such as the nuclear envelope, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomal tubules and budding sites of vesicular transport intermediates (Fig. 2c). For example, S-acylation of LRP6 is required for its association with endoplasmic reticulum exit sites and transport to the Golgi 138 . S-Acylated proteins concentrate into curved regions at the Golgi rims, which enables their anterograde trafficking to the plasma membrane 63 . The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) mediates the transport of S-acylated proteins, such as the EGF receptor (EGFR) 139 and the fatty acid transporter CD36 (ref. 140), out of the Golgi. Regardless of any conformational changes, S-acylation could promote interactions between cargo proteins and the armada of proteins that regulate membrane trafficking (Fig. 2e). In particular, S-acylation and deacylation cycles might positively or negatively regulate the endocytosis and targeting to lysosomes of numerous receptors, thereby fine-tuning their surface abundance 50,117,124,[141][142][143][144][145] . Through mechanisms that remain to be identified, S-acylation could also promote or inhibit the association of proteins with nascent transport vesicles and/or various regulators of membrane trafficking. The influence of S-acylation in protein localization is accentuated by the fact that many proteins involved in regulation of vesicular trafficking also require acylation, including small GTPases of the Rho family and various SNAREs 22,[146][147][148] .\n**Formation of multiprotein complexes**\nSignalling at the plasma membrane provides a compelling illustration of the importance of precisely recruiting and/or producing specific proteins and lipids at designated sites. Extracellular stimuli activate specific receptors that converge on a limited set of shared signalling molecules, such as the Src-family kinases, RAC\u03b1 serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the serine/ threonine-protein kinase mTOR. Nonetheless, the cellular response finely matches the initial stimulus. Localized sequential recruitment and activation of proteins at the membrane-cytosol interface ensure this response specificity, and S-acylation is well suited for orchestrating both the reversible lateral organization of membrane domains and the association of cytosolic proteins with these domains. The molecular underpinnings of the role of S-acylation in signal propagation is beginning to be uncovered. Stimulus-induced cycles of S-acylation and deacylation (in which, for example, a signal might trigger S-acylation of a receptor that is then internalized and subsequently deacylated) have indeed been observed for signalling through growth factor receptors 149,150 , G-protein-coupled receptors 151,152 , T cell receptors 153 and cytokine receptors 64 . The formation of multiprotein complexes at membrane interfaces has implications well beyond signalling pathways. Such platforms also mediate functional interactions between the membranes of two distinct cells, as in neuronal or immunological synapses, or between the membranes of different organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria membrane contact sites 8,15 . For example, when calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum are too low, the transmembrane endoplasmic reticulum calcium sensor stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) adopts an extended conformation that enables it to interact with and activate calcium release-activated calcium channel protein 1 (ORAI1)-containing calcium channels at endoplasmic reticulum-plasma membrane contact sites. Assembly of STIM1-ORAI1 complexes requires S-acylation of both STIM1 and ORAI1 (refs. 154-156). This lipid modification affects both the membrane nanodomain localization and conformation of these two proteins, thereby facilitating their interaction.\n**Crosstalk with other modifications**\nCoordination of signalling events demands the precise orchestration of various proteins and necessitates that each protein possesses 'evolving' properties; that is, ones mediated by multiple sequential and reversible post-translational modifications that can also influence each other. Indeed, S-acylation can be influenced by many other post-translational modifications of cysteine residues, such as S-nitrosylation 157 and oxidation 158 . Furthermore, S-acylation both influences and is influenced by phosphorylation 38 , ubiquitylation 19,137,143 , methylation, acetylation 77 and succinylation 159 . However, these documented interactions are likely to be only the tip of the iceberg 77,160,161 . Illustrative examples of such crosstalk are mentioned throughout this Review, for example those involving ZDHHC5, APT2 and LRP6.\n**Cellular and physiological processes**\nGiven that S-acylation affects the ability of proteins to interact with one another at membrane interfaces, it is not surprising that this post-translational modification influences many cellular processes, including endothelial cell and cardiac cell function 11 as well as cell adhesion, growth and division. The function of adhesion molecules [162][163][164][165] , claudins 166 and desmosomal proteins 75 depends on S-acylation. The dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton (both the actomyosin network and microtubules) required for cell division also relies on acylation-deacylation cycles of proteins such as protocadherin 7 (ref. 167) and tubulin 168 . Among the many possible options, in this Review we focus on how S-acylation can regulate and be regulated by signalling receptors, given their crucial upstream involvement in many cellular processes. We also discuss important contributions of S-acylation to autophagy, metabolism, innate immunity and brain function.\n**Signalling receptors**\nThe intricate relationship between S-acylation and signalling is beautifully illustrated in the heart, in which ZDHHC5 is a key player 78 . Cardiac contractility is stimulated by the activation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2-ARs). In cardiomyocytes, \u03b2-AR agonist treatment leads to a rapid and transient increase in ZDHHC5-mediated S-acylation of G\u03b1 coupled to \u03b2-AR 152 . The kinetics of G\u03b1 S-acylation correlates with the timing of cAMP production and with cardiomyocyte contractile responses. Interestingly, \u03b2-AR agonist treatment also increases S-acylation of ZDHHC5 at its C-terminal cysteines 78 . Although ZDHHC20 was not investigated in this study, it might also participate in this signalling pathway as ZDHHC20 is responsible for ZDHHC5 acylation 76 , which stabilizes ZDHHC5 at the plasma membrane and thereby maintains its proximity to components of the \u03b2-AR signalling module within membrane nanodomains 38,169 .\nZDHHC5 is also involved in insulin-dependent regulation of sodium-calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1) 149 . NCX1 undergoes S-acylation on an intracellular loop flanked by multiple transmembrane domains, which triggers a conformational change that leads to its inactivation. Insulin stimulates the activity of ZDHHC5 by triggering acylation of its\n**Review article**\nactive-site cysteine. Moreover, insulin is well known to trigger fatty acid and fatty acyl-CoA synthesis, which could contribute to the increased S-acylation of ZDHHC5. Indeed, blocking long fatty acyl-CoA synthetase with the inhibitor triacsin C abrogated insulin-stimulated acylation of ZDHHC5, and consequently maintained NCX1 activity. These findings highlight the importance of considering regulation of S-acylation by acyl-CoA availability.\nMany 'promiscuous' signalling molecules, such as the Src-like kinases, AKT and AMPKs, also undergo cycles of acylation and deacylation. Acylation can localize these proteins on membrane surfaces and might additionally control the shuttling of some proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) can be acylated by ZDHHC7, leading to its cell membrane association 64 . When cells are stimulated with growth factors or interferons, STAT3 is phosphorylated, which converts it into a substrate of APT2. Deacylation of STAT3 enables its release from the plasma membrane and transport into the nucleus, where STAT3 can switch on a transcriptional response. STAT3 is also required for the differentiation of T helper 17 cells (T H 17) cells. T H 17 cell overactivation leads to autoinflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease. Accordingly, APT2 inhibitors such as ML349 could be of therapeutic interest in these disorders 64 (Tables 1 and2).\n**Autophagy**\nMaintenance of cellular homeostasis demands the efficient and precisely regulated clearance of damaged proteins and organelles. Autophagy plays an important part in this process, and can even take over when the proteasome system is overwhelmed [170][171][172] . Autophagy is an intricate process that involves numerous molecules that recognize damaged proteins or organelles, generate autophagosomes to encapsulate them and mediate their subsequent fusion with lysosomes. A role for S-acylation in autophagy 173 is increasingly recognized, particularly in the context of neurodegeneration 22 . Several soluble autophagy regulators, such as huntingtin 174 , AKT 175 , ragulator complex\n**Review article**\nprotein LAMTOR1 and mTOR 176 transition from the cytosol to cell membranes after S-acylation. The important autophagy receptor sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1; also known as ubiquitin-binding protein p62) also undergoes acylation 177,178 . Upon autophagy induction, p62 binds to ubiquitylated proteins that are earmarked for degradation, forming p62 condensates. Their subsequent recruitment to LC3 + autophagocytic membranes depends on ZDHHC19-mediated acylation of p62 (ref. 178). Preventing p62 deacylation by APT1 leads to increased autophagic flux and enhanced protein clearance 178 . This finding aligns with observations of reduced p62 acylation in mice and patients with Huntington disease 177 , which suggests that elevating p62 acylation levels might have therapeutic potential in some neurodegenerative diseases.\n**Fatty acid and glucose uptake**\nInsulin, which stimulates fatty acid and glucose uptake, is secreted by pancreatic \u03b2-cells in response to high blood glucose levels in a multistep process that heavily relies on S-acylated proteins 179 . However, the extent of S-acylation must be finely tuned to avoid excessive as well as insufficient acylation. For example, mice with APT1 deficiency have hyperinsulinaemia, which is linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus 180 . The underlying defect was pinpointed as altered secretory vesicle \n**Review article**\ntrafficking, which prolonged membrane fusion. SCAMP1 (secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 1) was identified as the substrate of APT1 responsible for this effect, as hyperinsulinaemia could be rescued by an acylation-deficient SCAMP1 mutant 122 . Fatty acids are essential for S-acylation as they are substrates for acyl-CoA synthetase 181 , although acyl-CoAs can also be produced de novo through the action of fatty acid synthase (FASN). Fatty acid uptake primarily relies on the translocase CD36 (ref. 182), which spans the membrane twice and includes a large luminal (or extracellular) fatty acid binding domain along with cytoplasmic N and C termini (Fig. 4a). Each CD36 transmembrane domain has two juxtamembranous cytosolic cysteines that undergo S-acylation 182 in the endoplasmic reticulum by ZDHHC4 (ref. 183), ZDHHC7 (ref. 184) or ZDHHC6 with the help of its cofactor SelK 185,186 . S-Acylation of CD36 is required for its efficient folding and transport through the secretory pathway 139,140,183 . Around 50% of CD36 reaches the plasma membrane constitutively but insulin stimulation augments surface levels of CD36 via delivery from intracellular stores. At the plasma membrane, ZDHHC5-mediated S-acylation of CD36 controls its localization in nanodomains, and is counteracted by APT1-mediated constitutive deacylation 140,183,187 . S-Acylation is also essential for the lipid uptake capacity of CD36 and for the activation of downstream signalling mediators, such as tyrosine-protein kinases LYN, FYN and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 186 . Binding of extracellular fatty acids triggers APT1-mediated deacylation and endocytosis of CD36, thereby enabling intracellular delivery of its lipid cargo. CD36 is then re-acylated by ZDHHC5 and recycled to the plasma membrane for another round of fatty acid uptake 188 . This dynamic acylation-deacylation cycle is highly regulated. Fatty acid binding also provides a negative feedback loop initiated by activation of the Src kinase LYN, which subsequently phosphorylates Tyr91 of ZDHHC5, thereby inhibiting its activity.\nInsulin secretion triggers glucose uptake, which is mediated by facilitative transporters such as glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). Similar to CD36, GLUT4 is sequestered in the endosomal-trans-Golgi network system under basal conditions. Upon insulin stimulation, GLUT4 is transported to the plasma membrane in a ZDHHC7-dependent manner 189 . Mice with knockout of zDHHC7 consistently display hyperglycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance, which are characteristics of type 2 diabetes mellitus 190 (Tables 1 and2).\nTransport of both CD36 and GLUT4 to the cell surface is controlled by AMPK and AKT. In response to energy stress, AMPK, AKT and the AKT modulator CAP-Gly domain-containing linker protein 3 (also known as cytoplasmic linker protein 170-related 59 kDa protein (CLIPR-59)) are recruited to the plasma membrane in a manner predominantly orchestrated by ZDHHC17-mediated S-acylation 175,[191][192][193] .\n**Innate immunity**\nPathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are detected in cells by various sensors present either at the membrane surface or intracellularly. Tight compartmentalization enables cells to respond to even the lowest concentrations of microbial products with inflammatory and antimicrobial signalling cascades. S-Acylation is emerging as a key regulator of innate immune sensing and signal transduction responses, and alterations in protein S-acylation have been associated with various autoinflammatory disorders 10,11,21,64,194 (Tables 1 and2).\nThree principles have started to emerge (Fig. 3). The first is that S-acylation ensures that the transmembrane sensors of extracellular microbial products such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the death receptors FAS and TNFR1 are present at the plasma membrane in sufficient amounts and localize to specific nanodomains 10,124,194 (Fig. 3a).\nThe second principle is that S-acylation can regulate the ligand-induced formation of signalling platforms and/or complexes (Fig. 3b). For example, S-acylation of some TLRs and the downstream effector MyD88 are required for nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling and pro-inflammatory cytokine production 195 . S-Acylation of TNFR1 is required for TNF-induced signalling, and the subsequent cellular response is sustained through APT2-mediated deacylation of TNFR1 and its transport to intracellular signalling platforms 124 . S-Acylation can also act as a negative regulator of ligand-receptor interactions. For example, TNF is generated from a transmembrane TNF precursor, which is S-acylated to ensure that it does not bind to TNFR1 when both are present at the cell surface, thereby avoiding uncontrolled cell death 196 . Signalling in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA also depends on S-acylation of the cytosolic DNA-sensing enzyme cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and the transmembrane protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes), which responds to cyclic GMP-AMP. The enzyme activity of cGAS depends on its dimerization, which is differentially affected by S-acylation of three different cysteines by two different enzymes, ZDHHC9 (ref. 197) and ZDHHC18 (ref. 198). S-Acylation of STING occurs upon its GMP-AMP-induced transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, which enables recruitment of downstream Some Toll-like receptors (TLRs) localize to the cell surface and to specific domains in an S-acylation-dependent manner, as do tumour necrosis factor 1 receptor (TNFR1) and the death receptor Fas. b, S-Acylation influences the ability of various transmembrane and soluble intracellular innate immunity sensors to signal to their downstream effectors. Zinc-finger and aspartatehistidine-histidine-cysteine (DHHC) motif-containing (ZDHHC) enzymes and acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) identified in each situation are mentioned in parentheses. Signalling through TLRs requires S-acylation of the downstream effector MYD88 (1). S-Acylation of the transmembrane TNF precursor and TNFR1 ensure that the two transmembrane proteins remain segregated in different regions of the plasma membrane, which prevents premature binding of TNF to its receptor. Binding of soluble TNF to its receptor triggers deacylation and endocytosis, which initiates further intracellular signalling (2). The function and dimerization of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) depends on its S-acylation status (3). The cyclic dinucleotides generated by cGAS bind to STING (stimulator of interferon genes) but its ability to signal to downstream effectors once transported to the Golgi depends on its S-acylation (4). The intracellular danger detectors NOD1 and NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins 1 and 2, respectively) must undergo S-acylation before associating with intracellular bacteria-containing membrane-bound structures and inducing appropriate signalling and inflammatory responses (5). c, S-Acylation accelerates or slows down the lysosomal degradation of innate immunity sensors. Stimulus-provoked assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces caspase-1-mediated proteolysis of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D. However, for gasdermin D to oligomerize and puncture membranes it must undergo S-acylation (1). Given the potency of the NLRP3 inflammasome, it must be switched off by S-acylation of NLRP3, which leads to its targeting to lysosomes via chaperone-mediated autophagy (2). S-Acylation of NOD2 also inhibits its targeting to autophagosomes in a p62-dependent manner (3). LYPLA1, lysophospholipase 1.\n**Review article**\nfactors and triggering of the transcriptional immune response 199,200 . Sensing of cytosolic PAMPs leads to the assembly of the proteolytic inflammasome complex 201,202 . NLRP3, which is one of the major sensors leading to inflammasome assembly 203 , requires S-acylation in order to oligomerize 204 . Finally, the cytosolic sensors NOD1 and NOD2 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins 1 and 2, respectively) also rely on S-acylation for their recruitment to bacteria-containing endosomes, which is essential for their ability to sense peptidoglycan and trigger NF-\u03baB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways 205 .\nThe third principle is that S-acylation can also regulate the duration and/or amplitude of innate immune responses (Fig. 3c). S-Acylation sustains NOD2-mediated signalling by preventing the degradation of NOD2 through p62-mediated autophagy 206 . By contrast, S-acylation also inactivates inflammasomes by inducing a conformational change in NLRP3, thereby unmasking a recognition site that targets it for chaperone-mediated autophagy 205 . The S-acylation events that precipitate oligomerization occur at different sites in NLRP3 and involve a different ZDHHC enzyme to those associated with S-acylation events leading to inflammasome degradation 202,204 . Dampening of the NLRP3 inflammasome is important to reduce the cleavage of gasdermin D, a pore-forming protein that drives inflammatory cell death in a process known as pyroptosis 207 . Gasdermins are produced as inactive precursors that undergo processing by the NLRP3 inflammasome. Much research effort has been invested in identifying drugs that block gasdermin pore formation and thereby inhibit pyroptosis. Remarkably, all such agents identified so far affect the same cysteine in gasdermin D 159,[208][209][210][211] , which requires S-acylation for gasdermin D oligomerization and pore formation to occur 212,213 . Consistent with this observation, inhibition of deacylation promotes pyroptosis 214 .\n**Brain function**\nS-Acylation governs numerous brain processes, including the differentiation and maturation of diverse brain cell types [215][216][217] , neural circuit formation during development [218][219][220] and modulation of neuronal plasticity [221][222][223][224][225] . As a consequence, balanced S-acylation is essential for learning, memory and appropriate behavioural responses 217,221,222,226,227 . In the brain, S-acylation is particularly dynamic and responds to stress 157 , learning events 228 and synaptic activity 56,57,80,222,225,229,230 . As in other tissues, S-acylation in the brain involves post-translational modification of ZDHHC enzymes, which alters their stability, function and/or subcellular localization 77,80 .\nAt the cellular level, S-acylation has been studied mostly in neurons (Fig. 4b) where it regulates neuronal development, axon and dendrite growth, and also promotes the precise targeting and clustering of Na V and voltage-gated potassium channels to the axon initial segment 231 , thereby regulating neuronal excitability. Approximately 45% of all synaptic proteins are substrates for S-acylation, including adhesion molecules, synaptic vesicle release machinery, signalling molecules, neurotransmitter receptors, scaffold proteins and kinases 221,226,232 . In addition, strong evidence indicates that S-acylation regulates the formation and plasticity of synapses. S-Acylation, therefore, directly regulates neural output and communication. Oligodendrocytes depend on S-acylation for their maturation 217,233 and their ability to form the myelin sheaths that wrap around axons and support efficient neuronal function 217,234 . The importance of S-acylation in myelin formation is further bolstered by SwissPalm data showing that almost all of the myelin proteome (94% in mice, 83% in humans) could be substrates for S-acylation.\nVirtually all known S-acylating enzymes are expressed in the brain 44 (Box 1), where they have unique spatial and developmental patterns of expression that affect their substrate specificity and regulate their function. Although it is unclear which enzymes are involved in many of the aforementioned processes, the role of a subset of enzymes in the brain has been described (Fig. 4b).\nAlterations in S-acylation, deacylation and the balance between the two have a pathogenetic role in disorders of the nervous system, inflammatory and immune diseases, metabolic disorders (such as diabetes and obesity) and many types of cancer [17][18][19][20] (Tables 1 and2). Mutations in ZDHHCs and acyl-thioesterases or in their target proteins resulting in diminished acylation can also contribute to disease. Interestingly, proteins can also acquire deleterious gain-of-acylation mutations. For example, a gain-of-acylation mutation in cell division control protein 42 homologue (CDC42), a Rho-family GTPase, led to severe autoinflammatory syndrome 235 . Although S-acylation contributes to many diseases, in this Review we specifically focus on cancer and brain disorders. Cancer is particularly interesting owing to its intersection with both signalling and immunity, and a wealth of information is available on the role of S-acylation in higher brain functions.\n**Cancer**\nCancer is driven by alterations in multiple cellular processes such as cell growth, division, polarity, migration, energy metabolism and immune recognition, which all extensively rely on S-acylation 17,18 . Regulators of these processes include Ras family GTPases, Src-family kinases, EGFR, MAPK, AKT, protein scribble homologue (SCRIB), mTOR, WNT proteins, Frizzled receptors and LRP6 (refs. 17,18). Understanding Ras acylation-deacylation cycles has been an important driving force in S-acylation research 96 . Altered expression of ZDHHC and APT enzymes affects cancer progression, which is consistent with a contribution of S-acylation (Tables 1 and2). S-Acylation has, therefore, become a promising target for new anticancer therapies 21 .\nS-Acylation is implicated in various immune-escape strategies used by tumour cells. ZDHHC20 promotes pancreatic cancer metastasis by altering the surface proteome of tumour cells, which impairs their recognition by natural killer cells 236 . Cytotoxic T cells can also kill tumour cells. However, tumour cells exploit a regulatory pathway that prevents these T cells from accidentally killing healthy cells. This pathway involves expression of the transmembrane protein PDL1 on tumour cells, a 'don't kill me' signal that is recognized by its receptor PD1 on T cells. Interaction of PDL1 and PD1 inhibits T cell activation, thus making tumour cells invisible to the immune system. Treatment with antibodies that block this ligand-receptor interaction are highly beneficial in some oncological settings, but many tumours do not respond to such so-called immune checkpoint blockade. However, surface expression of PDL1 is dependent on its acylation by ZDHHC3 (ref. 237)  or ZDHHC9 (ref. 238), which protects PDL1 from ubiquitylation and targeting to lysosomes. Preventing PDL1 acylation, either by cysteine mutagenesis or ZDHHC silencing, led to increased T cell-mediated tumour cell killing [237][238][239] , indicating that promoting S-acylation of PDL1 is a promising strategy to prevent tumour immune evasion. Lipid metabolic enzymes (which influence fatty acid availability and promote the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells) might constitute additional potential therapeutic targets.\nTumour cell death can also be triggered by pyroptosis 240 , although this process requires efficient checkpoints if it is not to accidentally kill healthy cells. Some cancer treatments induce pyroptosis, which leads to the release of inflammatory molecules that promote Review article lymphocyte recruitment and favour clearance of tumour cells by the immune system. As gasdermins require S-acylation for pore formation, S-acylation-promoting treatments are of great interest in this context 241 . Pyroptosis might also enhance the antitumour efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nTumour cells can also evade innate immune surveillance by downregulating STING, which detects cytosolic DNA originating from damaged micronuclei 242,243 . Levels of STING protein are greatly decreased in gastric cancers 244 . Thus, increasing S-acylation of STING, which both stabilizes this protein and promotes its capacity to trigger an immune response, might have therapeutic potential. Finally, tumour progression could be inhibited by reducing the glucose supply necessary for tumorigenesis. Targeting ZDHHC9, the enzyme responsible for acylation and plasma membrane localization of GLUT1, reduced tumorigenesis by decreasing glucose availability in glioblastoma cells 245 .\nExcitatory synapse plasticity: \n**Review article**\n**Diseases of the central nervous system**\nDysregulated S-acylation has been implicated in numerous brain diseases, including neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders (Table 1). The association between S-acylation and neurodegenerative disorders is tenuous and primarily lies in the S-acylation-mediated regulation of key disease-associated proteins, including huntingtin (Huntington disease) [246][247][248][249] , \u03b1-synuclein (Parkinson disease) 250,251 and amyloid precursor protein (Alzheimer disease) 252,253 . In fact, widespread changes in protein S-acylation have been identified in the cortices of patients with Parkinson disease 254 , and a variant of ZDHHC21 was identified in a family with familial Alzheimer disease 255 . These findings support the possible existence of direct associations between disrupted S-acylation and neurodegenerative disorders.\nBy contrast, strong evidence supports a causative role of genetic disruptions in S-acylating enzymes in developmental disorders. ZDHHC9 loss-of-function mutations cause Raymond-type syndromic X-linked intellectual developmental disorder, which is associated with a high incidence of comorbid epilepsy 256 . Genetic alterations in ZDHHC15 have been observed in individuals with X-linked intellectual developmental disorder 19 (XLID19) 257 , Smith-Magenis syndrome and autism 258 . Finally, genetic disruptions in ZDHHC5 (ref. \n\n**Conclusions**\nWhen S-acylation of viral glycoproteins was discovered in the late 1970s (Supplementary Box 1), it was unimaginable that 50 years later S-acylation would emerge as a pivotal post-translational modification used to finely regulate nearly every cellular process with astonishing precision. Such precision is feasible owing to the capacity of S-acylation and deacylation enzymes not only to switch protein function on or off but also to meticulously govern ingress and egress of proteins at membrane interfaces, in terms of both location and timing.\nDespite considerable advances in understanding of protein S-acylation, great challenges lie ahead from both a basic science and a clinical perspective. Of particular interest is the intricate interplay between S-acylation and deacylation enzymes, as correct functioning of most ZDHHCs and acyl-thioesterases requires cycles of acylation and deacylation. Therefore, S-acylation provides a unique opportunity for achieving systems-level functional understanding. In contrast to phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, which are mediated by hundreds to thousands of enzymes, S-acylation involves fewer than 30 enzymes, which offers the fascinating prospect of studies to comprehensively map how each enzyme modifies and is modified by the others. Subsequently, using predictive mathematical models and experimentation, we can evaluate the benefits and purposes of these interconnections. Crosstalk with other post-transcriptional modifications adds another layer of complexity for which only the surface has been scratched so far, and no rules have yet emerged.\nFuture challenges include the development of novel inhibitors. Presently, no inhibitors specific to individual ZDHHC enzymes have been identified, unlike those for some deacylation enzymes. The design of inhibitors specific to a given substrate, rather than specific to the modifying enzyme(s), presents an interesting alternative with great potential 200 . A crucial missing piece to achieve this goal is a high-resolution structure of a ZDHHC bound to its protein substrate. The field also lacks tools to monitor the acylation status of a protein or to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of S-acylation in living cells. For example, no equivalents currently exist of the antibodies that target phosphorylated versions of particular proteins, but conformation-specific recombinant antibodies, such as those developed to recognize the S-acylated form of PSD95 (ref. 261), offer an interesting alternative. A comprehensive view of the targetome of each ZDHHC and deacylation enzyme is also lacking. Artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches could potentially expedite the assignment of ZDHHCs to specific substrates. Other important future avenues include determining how the acyl-proteome of a cell is influenced by extracellular stimuli, such as cytokines, inflammatory mediators or growth factors, as well as the metabolic state of the cell or the organism.\nNonetheless, the amassed knowledge outlined in this Review serves as a foundation for the development of therapeutics based on S-acylation. Future investigative work is required to determine the therapeutic potential of approaches targeting ZDHHCs and APTs to fight specific diseases. \n**Dendritic spines**\nSmall membrane protrusions that receive input from a single axon at the synapse; similar protrusions can also occur on flat membranes (dendritic shafts). \n**Fatty acids**\n**Hydrophobic mismatch**\nA situation where the length of an orthogonal transmembrane helix of a protein differs from (that is, is shorter or longer than) the thickness of a membrane.\n**Inflammasome**\nA multiprotein proteolytic complex that forms in the cytosol in response to sensing of molecules of bacterial origin or danger signals such as low potassium levels; inflammasomes cleave the precursors of IL-1\u03b2 and gasdermins.\n**Insulin**\nA peptide hormone that regulates glucose homeostasis and has anabolic actions on target tissues that enable the body to build energy reserves when glucose is abundant.\n**Membrane contact sites**\nSites of membrane juxtaposition between organelles. mTOR A kinase that regulates numerous cellular processes, including cell growth and proliferation, that are important in cancer.\n**Oligodendrocytes**\nGlial cells of the central nervous system whose main function is to insulate the axons of neurons by forming a myelin sheath.\n**Pyroptosis**\nA form of programmed cell death that occurs during inflammation and involves gasdermin pore formation in the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane.\n**Spike protein**\nThe SARS-CoV-2 viral glycoprotein responsible for its characteristic crown appearance; the spike protein binds to host cells and facilitates fusion of the viral membrane with that of the infected cell.\n\n\nOver the past two decades, protein S-acylation (often referred to as S-palmitoylation) has emerged as an important regulator of vital signalling pathways. S-Acylation is a reversible post-translational modification that involves the attachment of a fatty acid to a protein. Maintenance of the equilibrium between protein S-acylation and deacylation has demonstrated profound effects on various cellular processes, including innate immunity, inflammation, glucose metabolism and fat metabolism, as well as on brain and heart function. This Review provides an overview of current understanding of S-acylation and deacylation enzymes, their spatiotemporal regulation by sophisticated multilayered mechanisms, and their influence on protein function, cellular processes and physiological pathways. Furthermore, we examine how disruptions in protein S-acylation are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases from cancer to autoinflammatory disorders and neurological conditions.Sections As transmembrane proteins, ZDHHCs localize to membrane-bound organelles, to which they seem to be targeted via well-established signals (as shown for ZDHHC4 and ZDHHC6) 47 . Most ZDHHCs are present in the endoplasmic reticulum (for example, ZDHHC1, ZDHHC4, ZDHHC6 and ZDHHC7) [47][48][49][50] , including the nuclear envelope (ZDHHC6) 51 and Golgi (such as ZDHHC3 and ZDHHC20) 48,52 , or are found throughout the entire early secretory pathway (such as ZDHHC2, ZDHHC4, ZDHHC14, ZDHHC19 and ZDHHC21) [53][54][55] . A few ZDHHCs are present both at the plasma membrane and in the endocytic system (ZDHHC2 and ZDHHC5). However, subcellular localization of ZDHHCs is not static. For example, in neurons, blockade of synaptic activity induces the translocation of ZDHHC2 from dendritic shafts to post-synaptic\nRelated links\n\n",
