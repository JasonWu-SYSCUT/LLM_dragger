    "fullText": "**Fig 1. palAPP dimerizes ~4**\n.5 times more efficiently compared totAPP and in cis-orientiation. A. Cells expressing APP V5 or APP V5 plus HA-APP Y were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation assays to detect APP V5 /HA-APP Y interaction or APP-dimerization. APP V5 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-V5 antibody. Immunoprecipitates were probed with an anti-HA antibody to detect pull-down of HA-APP Y . Subsequently the immunoprecipitates were subjected to mABE assay to detect palAPP V5 /HA-APP Y interaction (or palAPP-dimerization). PalAPP V5 pulled down both palAPP V5 (M wt ~102 kD) and palHA-APP Y (M wt ~150 kD) from cells expressing APP V5 plus HA-APP Y but not from cells expressing only APP V5 . B. TotAPP-dimers (APP V5 /HA-APP Y ) only form in cells expressing both APP V5 and HA-APP Y . C. Quantitation of palAPP-dimers (palAPP V5 /palHA-APP Y ) versus totAPP-dimers (APP V5 /HA-APP Y ). Error bars show the s.e.m. (**p<0.01). D. palAPP dimerizes is cis-orientiation. Cells expressing HA-APP Y and cells expressing mycAPP were co-cultured in absence or presence of 1mM cell-impermeable cross-linker DTSSP. Cell extracts were subjected to a pull-down assay, using an anti-HA antibody to immunoprecipitate HA-APP Y . To test for APP-dimerization, the precipitates were probed with an anti-myc antibody (panel b, co-culture). Cells co-expressing HA-APP Y and mycAPP were also subjected to a co-IP assay using the anti-HA antibody to pull-down mycAPP with HA-APP Y .(panel b, co-expression). To detect palAPP-dimerization, the immunoprecipitates were also subjected to mABE assay to detect co-IP of palHA-APP Y with pal-mycAPP (panel a). The experiment is a representative of three independent experiments. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299972.g001 Little or no co-IP of flAPP observed upon treatment with100 \u03bcg/ml cerulenin. In contrast, cerulenin had no effect on CTF V5 pull-down even at the highest concentration (100 \u03bcg/ml). Cerulenin reduced palAPP HA levels in a dose-dependent manner (ABE assay) reaching complete inhibition at 100 \u03bcg/ml concentration. B. co-IP assay using an antibody specific for mGFP (anti-mGFP) to pull-down full-length (fl) APP mGFP with APP mCherry from differentiated neuronal cells (RenVM) co-expressing APP mGFP +APP mCherry . Anti-mGFP also pulled-down CTF mCherry with CTF mGFP . Cerulenin (25 \u03bcg/ml) treatment of the cells prior to co-IP assay dramatically decreased flAPP mGFP -flAPP mCherry interaction, but not that of CTF mGFP -CTF mCherry .\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0299972.g003\n\n\n\nIn Fig 1, there were two instances of Fig 1B, whereas the figure legend referred to the presence of a Fig 1C. In Fig 2, the authors provide the correct HA-APP Y panel in Fig 2B. The published panel resulted from an inadvertent duplication of another gel, part of which correctly appears in lanes 2-4 of the HA-APP Y panel in Fig 3A. In Fig 6, the authors provide the correct APP-mGFP and CTF-mGFP panels in Fig 6B. The published panel resulted from an inadvertent duplication of the middle panels in Fig 6A. An error in labeling the top and middle panels of Fig 6A has been corrected. The original underlying quantitative data for this article were not included with the published article, but are now presented with this notice in S2 File. With this correction of this article [1], the authors provide updated versions of Fig 1, Fig 2, and Fig 6; original uncropped underlying blots for the figures of concern (S1 File); and the original underlying quantitative data for this article (S2 File).The authors apologize for the errors in the published article.\n\n",
