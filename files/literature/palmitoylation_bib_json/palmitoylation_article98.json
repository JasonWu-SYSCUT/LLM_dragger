    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers with poor prognosis in the head and neck. Elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying OSCC occurrence and development is important for the therapy. Dysregulated palmitoylation-related enzymes have been reported in several cancers but OSCC. OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) in OSCC. METHODS: Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and related protein-protein interaction networks between normal oral epithelial and OSCC tissues were screened and constructed via different online databases. Tumor samples from 70 OSCC patients were evaluated for the relationship between PPT1 expression level and patients'clinic characteristics. The role of PPT1 in OSCC proliferation and metastasis was studied by functional experiments, including MTT, colony formation, EdU incorporation and transwell assays. Lentivirus-based constructs were used to manipulate the gene expression. FerroOrange probe and malondialdehyde assay were used to determine ferroptosis. Growth of OSCC cells in vivo was investigated by a xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: A total of 555 DEGs were obtained, and topological analysis revealed that the PPT1 and GPX4 might play critical roles in OSCC. Increased PPT1 expression was found to be correlated with poor prognosis of OSCC patients. PPT1 effectively promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion while inhibiting the ferroptosis of OSCC cells. PPT1 affected the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4).

    "fullText": "**INTRODUCTION**\nOral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common cancer of the oral cavity and lips. In 2020, about 377,713 new cases and 177,757 deaths were reported worldwide [1][2][3]. Due to chronic alcohol consumption, smoking and betel nut chewing, the prevalence of OSCC in South Central Asia was relatively much higher [2,4,5]. Although new therapies are continuously introduced in cancer treatment, the overall survival rate of OSCC has no significant improvement, and advanced OSCC has an even lower 5year survival rate of approximately 20% [6][7][8]. To a certain extent, inherent or acquired resistance to therapeutic agents * Address correspondence to this author at the Central Laboratory, Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital, School of Medicine, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200443, China;E-mail: cqlw1975@126.com in patients with OSCC may contribute to treatment failure [9][10][11]. Therefore, further delineation of the molecular mechanisms underlying OSCC occurrence and development is important for the establishment of effective therapeutic strategies.\nTumors are distinguished by continuous cell proliferation, cell death resistance, increased cell invasion and metastasis etc. A variety of oncogenes and tumor suppressors regulates these processes. Posttranslational Modifications (PTMs) such as SUMOylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, lipidation, glycosylation etc., are involved in the modification of related oncogenes and tumor suppressors [12][13][14][15][16]. Recently, protein palmitoylation has attracted the interest of several researchers. As a reversible lipid modification, palmitoylation is characterized by the addition of 16-carbon palmitate to cysteine residues via the thioester bond [17]. In this way, the modified protein changes its hydrophobicity, localization, stability and interactions with other proteins, which leads to the activation or inhibition of related signaling pathways [17][18][19]. The zinc finger DHHC-type containing (ZDH-HC) protein family catalyze protein palmitoylation, while palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1/2 (PPT1/2), acyl-protein thioesterase 1/2 (APT1/2) and alpha/beta hydrolase-containing protein 17A/B/C (ABHD17A/B/C) mediate protein depalmitoylation [19,20]. There are various reports on the dysregulation of palmitoylation-related enzymes in cancers like breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), melanoma, prostate cancer, hematopoietic malignancies etc., which affect tumor cell growth or immune regulation [21][22][23][24][25][26]. However, neither palmitoylation nor its related enzymes have been well-studied in OSCC.\nRecently, ferroptosis has been found to be closely related to cancer progression [27][28][29]. Ferroptosis is a newly identified non-apoptotic cell death caused by phospholipid peroxidation, which is named for its iron dependence [27,28,[30][31][32]. The glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) reduces phospholipid hydroperoxides to their corresponding alcohols and thus plays a key role in inhibiting ferroptosis [23,[33][34][35][36]. Li et al. found that by increasing the stability of GPX4 and reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), cysteine protease inhibitors inhibited ferroptosis and promoted migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells [37]. Cai and Green et al. reported that angiogenesis-related hypoxia-inducible factor (HIFs) instability or ablation can reduce the susceptibility of renal clear cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer cells to ferroptosis, which revealed the interaction between ferroptosis and angiogenesis in cancer [38,39]. However, the role and related mechanisms of ferroptosis in OSCC progression are not fully understood.\nBy bioinformatic analysis, a potential key role of palmitoylation related enzyme-PPT1 was found in OSCC. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PPT1 expression level and the clinical features in OSCC patients, as well as the biological role of PPT1 in the regulation of proliferation, migration, invasion and ferroptosis of OSCC cells.\n\n**MATERIALS AND METHODS**\n**Differentially Expressed Genes Identification and Significant Genes Screening**\nThe gene expression profiles of OSCC and normal tissues were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov-/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE3524). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out according to the cut-off criteria of P<0.01 and fold change\u22652. The false discovery rate (FDR) was used for correction. DEGs enrichment analyses were performed by the R package \"clusterProfiler\". To explore the significant genes in OSCC, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs of DEGs were generated from the STRING database, and the criteria for PPI pairs were defined as a combined score\u22650.4. DEGs related PPI network was built by Cytoscape software (version 3.9), and the Clus-terONE algorithm was performed for core gene screening, which was defined as quality>0.60, node\u22656, density>0.05, combined score>0.95 and P<0.001.\n**Reconstruct the PPI Network and Identify the Core Targets**\nTo identify novel therapeutic targets in OSCC, the selected significant genes were used to reconstruct the PPI network using the IntAct, IMEx, and iRefIndex databases. In the rebuilt network, four parameters of each node were calculated: Closeness Centrality (CC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), Topological Coefficient (TC) and Degree (De). Here, core targets defined as CC\u2265Avg (CC), BC\u2265Avg (BC), TC\u2265Avg (TC) and De\u2265Avg (De) were considered highly correlated with OSCC development.\n**Patients and Tissue Specimens**\nPatients diagnosed with OSCC in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Head and Neck Oncology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital from Feb 2015 to Aug 2018, were enrolled in this study. All patients had no history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Clinic information and tumor samples were collected for further investigation. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital (Approval No: SH9H-2020-TK424-1). To explore the expression of PPT1, paraffin-embedded OSCC tissues were sectioned, deparaffinized, treated and scored as previously described [40]. The sectioned tissues were incubated with anti-PPT1 primary antibody (1:400, Abcam) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The pathological score of each slide was determined by the formula: score=percentage score \u00d7 staining intensity score. The staining intensity score was defined as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate) and 3 (strong). The percentage of positive cells was classified as 0 (0%), 1 (1%~25%), 2 (26%~50%), 3 (51%~75%) and 4 (>75%). According to the pathological score, patients were grouped into negative expression group (0), weak expression group (1~3) and strong expression group (4~12). The correlation of PP-T1 expression levels with the clinic stage of the patients was analyzed. Age, gender, alcohol consumption, smoking, and tumor site were considered potential confounders in this study. To follow up on the survival, we contacted these patients in July 2023. The clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.\n**Cell Culture**\nHuman OSCC cell lines-CAL-27, SCC-9 and WSU-H-N4 were used. CAL-27 (ATCC: CRL-2095) and SCC-9 (ATCC: CRL-1629) were obtained from Zhongyuan Biotech (Beijing, China). The Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, kindly provided the WSU-HN4 cells. The complete culture medium for CAL-27 and WSU-HN4 was DMEM (Gibco, Rockville, MD, United States) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) and 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin (Beyotime). SCC-9 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 100 \u03bcg/ml penicillin and 400 Primary normal epithelial cells (NEC) were isolated from 5 normal oral mucosal tissues with no clinically visible inflammation, which was obtained from retained wisdom teeth extraction operations as described previously [41,42]. The derived NECs were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSF; Gibco) with 0.2 ng/mL recombinant epidermal growth factor (rEGF; Gibco).\n**Ferrous Ion and Malondialdehyde (MDA) Detection**\nCells were treated with serum-free medium containing 1 \u00b5M FerroOrange (Dojindo, Japan) for 30 min at 37\n\u2022 C in the dark. Then, the fluorescence of the cells was observed under the microscope (Axio Vert.A1, Carl Zeiss, Germany). RSL3 (an activator of ferroptosis, which binds and inactivates GPX4) was bought from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) and dissolved in DMSO (Beyotime). Cells were lysed, and concentrations of MDA were determined by the Lipid Peroxidation MDA Assay Kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative cellular MDA concentration was presented as a percentage of control.\n**RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR**\nThe total RNA of OSCC cells and tissues was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). Then, cDNA was obtained, and Real-time PCR was performed by using the PrimeScript\u2122 RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) and TB Green\u00ae Premix Ex Taq\u2122 (TaKaRa) reaction system, respectively. Primer sequences were as followed. ppt1: sense 5'-CCCTGTAGATTCGGAGTGGT TTGG-3', antisense 5'-AGCTGTCCTGCATTGTCCAT TTCC-3'; gpx4: sense 5'-ATGGTTAACCTGGACAAGT ACC-3', antisense 5'-GACGAGCTGAGTGTAGTTTAC T-3'; gapdh: sense 5'-TCAAGGCTGAGAACGGGAAG-3', antisense 5'-TCGCCCCACTTGATTTTGGA-3'. GAPDH was used as an endogenous control.\n**Western Blotting Analysis**\nTotal protein was extracted, quantified and denatured as described previously [43]. Equal amounts of protein were loaded for electrophoresis and then electrophoretically transferred onto Polyvinylidene Difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After blocking, the blots were incubated with different primary antibodies and Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. An imaging system visualized target bands. Anti-bodies against PPT1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and GAPDH were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, USA). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were bought from ZSGB-Bio (Beijing, China).\n**Lentiviral Infection**\nCommercially available ppt1 overexpression lentiviral particles were obtained from GeneChem Biotech Co. (Shanghai, China) to establish cell lines with stable ppt1 overexpression. Lentivirus-based expression plasmid Ubi-MC-S-3FLAG-CBhgcGFP-IRES-puromycin constructs were used to carry ppt1 sequences. Primers for ppt1 were: forward 5'-CTCTAGAGGATCCCGCCACCATGGCGT CGC-CCGGCTGCCTG-3', reverse 5'-AGTCCATACCTC CAAGGAATGGTATGATGTGGGCATA-3'. To knockdown ppt1 expression, the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting sequences for ppt1 were as follows: KD-PPT1-1: 5'-CCACATCATACCATTCCTT-3,' KD-PPT1-2: 5'-CA-TAAAGGAGGATGTGTAT-3,' and KD-PPT1-3: 5'--GATCCAGCTTGCAACTAAT-3'. Lentivirus-based expression plasmid hU6-MCS-CBh-gcGFP-IRES-puromycin constructs were used to carry shRNA sequences. To eliminate the influence of vector transfection, a gene sequence with no significant homology to any mammalian was transfected into the cells (OE-vector and KD-mock). The cells were transfected and cultured as previously described.\n**Cell Proliferation and Transwell Assays**\nTo determine cell viability, cells were plated into 96well plates and 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution (Beyotime) was used. For the clonogenic assay, cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured for 2 weeks. Crystal violet (Beyotime) was used to stain the colonies. To determine the proliferation of cells, the 5-ethynyl-2' -deoxyuridine (EdU, Beyotime) incorporation assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell nuclei were re-stained with Hoechst 33342 (Beyotime), and images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope. To determine cell migration and invasion, the Transwell assays were adopted as described previously [40]. For cell invasion, Transwell inserts (Corning, New York, USA) were coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, USA). The lower wells were added with a complete culture medium, while OSCC cells in the upper wells were suspended with DMEM. Cells passed through the membrane were stained with crystal violet solution and observed under a microscope.\n**OSCC Cell Growth In Vivo**\nThe animal experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital (Approval No: SH9H-2020-A729-1). Male BALB/c nude mice about four weeks old were bought from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center (Shanghai, China) and kept in pathogen-free animal care facilities. OSCC cells were injected into the back next to the right hind limb of nude mice subcutaneously. Tumors were measured with a Vernier caliper every 3 days. Tumor volumes were calculated according to the following formula: tumor volume ( mm3 ) = longest diameter \u00d7 shortest diameter 2 \u00d7 0.52. Once the growing tumor reached the predetermined size, the mice were euthanized, and tumors were separated and weighed.\n**Statistical Analysis**\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, USA), and data were presented as mean \u00b1 SD. The relationship between PPT1 expression and patients' clinical features was analyzed with \u03c7 2 test. Independent sample t-test was performed for the two groups, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used among multiple groups. Sensitivity analysis was used to eliminate the interference caused by confounding factors, including gender, age, drinking, smoking, and tumor location. The overall survival rate was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n\n**RESULTS**\n**Differentially Expressed Genes Identification and Significant Genes Screening**\nUsing the cut-off criteria of FDR < 0.001 and fold change > 2, a total of 555 DEGs (212 upregulated and 323 downregulated genes) were screened between 16 OSCC tissues and four normal samples from GSE3524 (Fig. 1A). The top 10 Biological Process (BP) terms revealed by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis were mainly associated with epidermal development, skin development, epidermal cell differentiation, regulation of epithelial cell proliferation, fatty acid metabolic processes, keratinocyte differentiation, keratinization, intermediate filament-based processes, intermediate filament cytoskeleton organization, and peptide cross-linking (Fig. 1B). The top 10 Cellular Component (CC) terms were correlated with chromosomal regions, cornified envelopes, condensed chromosomes, ficolin-1-rich granules, tertiary granules, desmosomes, MHC class I protein complexes, mitotic checkpoint complexes, and epidermal lamellar bodies (Fig. 1C). The top 10 Molecular Function (MF) terms included cadherin binding, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, ubiquitin-like protein ligase binding, protein serine kinase activity, structural constituents of the skin epidermis and cell adhesion mediator activity (Fig. 1D). The top 10 terms derived from KEGG pathway analysis were mainly associated with cell cycle, lipid and atherosclerosis, cellular senescence, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus infection, MAPK signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, human cytomegalovirus infection, Influenza A, Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection and Ras signaling pathway (Fig. 1E).\nTo screen for significant genes in OSCC, DEGs related PPI network was constructed using the STRING database (Fig. 1F). By performing the ClusterONE algorithm, 105 significant genes were isolated from the network, which were defined as quality>0.60, node\u22656, density>0.05, combined score>0.95 and P<0.001 (Fig. 1G). These genes may be important in the development of OSCC.\n**Reconstruct the PPI Network and Identify the Core Targets**\nTo explore the core targets of OSCC, 105 significant genes were used to reconstruct the core PPI network using the IntAct, IMEx, and iRefIndex databases (Fig. 2A). In the PPI network, core nodes were defined as BC \u2265 avg (BC), CC \u2265 avg (CC), De \u2265 avg (De), and TC \u2265 avg (TC). Finally, 6 core targets and related clusters were isolated from the PPI network (Fig. 2B, Table 1), including CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator), IFI16 (interferon-gamma inducible protein 16), GPX4, PPT1, FYN (FYN proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase), and FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) clusters. To further identify novel therapeutic targets in OSCC, these six core clusters were merged (Fig. 2C), and topological structure analysis revealed that the interacting PPT1 and GPX4 clusters played critical roles in the network (Fig. 2D).\n**High Expression of PPT1 is Related to Poor Prognosis of OSCC**\nTo further identify the results of bioinformatic analyses, PPT1 expression in 70 clinical specimens was determined first. The patients consisted of 51 males and 19 females. Information on ages, smoking status, alcohol use, tumor location, AJCC stages, T stages and N stages of the patients was listed in Table 2. Significantly higher PPT1 expression in OSCC tissues than in adjacent normal tissues was found both by qRT-PCR and western blotting (Fig. 3A and3B). 81.42% (57/70) cases had positive staining for PPT1, of which 57.89% (33/57) showed high expression and 42.11% (24/57) showed low expression (Fig. 3C,Table 2). A significant association was observed between PPT1 expression with the clinic stages of OSCC patients (AJCC stage, P=0.014; T stage, P=0.005; N stage, P=0.013) (Table 2). Moreover, OSCC patients with higher PPT1 expression levels exhibited lower overall survival rate, with 16 cases developing tumor progression and 11 of them having high expression of PPT1 (Fig. 3D). These data indicated that PPT1was positively correlated with the undesirable clinical characteristics in OSCC.\n**PPT1 Facilitates the Proliferation and Metastasis of OSCC Cells In Vitro**\nTo confirm the pro-tumor effect of PPT1 in OSCC, OSCC cell lines were used. PPT1 expression in OSCC cells \n**). (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).**\nwas significantly increased (Fig. 4A and4B). Next, we established the PPT1 overexpression or knockdown cell lines using CAL-27. PPT1 expression was significantly increased in OE-PPT1 cells, and shRNA targeting sequence 3 (KD-PP-T1-3) transfection showed the most potent knockdown effect, with a 25.14-fold decrease in mRNA expression (Fig. 4C and4D). Thus, we used KD-PPT1-3 cells for subsequent experiments. Results indicated that PPT1 overexpression significantly increased the proliferation, colony formation, and EdU incorporation of OSCC cells, whereas the knockdown of PPT1 led to the opposite effects (Fig. 4E-I). PPT1 overexpression also facilitated the migration and invasion of OSCC cells (Fig. 4J). Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were further identified. Consistently, the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin was increased, whereas the epithelial adhesion marker E-cadherin was decreased in PP-T1-overexpressed OSCC cells (Fig. 4K). In OSCC cells with PPT1 knockdown, the opposite phenomenon was observed (Fig. 4K). Thus, these results suggested that PPT1 facilitated the proliferation and metastasis of OSCC cells.\n**PPT1 Enhances the Growth of OSCC Cells In Vivo**\nTo explore the effect of PPT1 on OSCC cell growth in vivo, the OSCC xenograft mouse model was used. OSCC cells overexpressing PPT1 overexpression (OE-PPT1), knockdown (KD-PPT1-3), or mock vector (OE-vector and KD-mock) were injected subcutaneously into mice as described in materials and methods. Increased tumor size was observed in tumors from the PPT1 overexpression group, whereas distinctly reduced tumor size was found in the PP-T1 knockdown group (Fig. 5A and5B). Similar patterns were observed in the tumor weights of different groups (Fig. 5C). These data showed that PPT1 enhanced the growth of OSCC cells in vivo.\n**PPT1 Impairs Ferroptosis via Regulating GPX4 Expression**\nAs a newly discovered form of non-apoptotic programmed cell death, ferroptosis has been a focus of research in a variety of diseases, including cancer [43]. GPX4 is a \n**). (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).**\nwell-known ferroptosis inhibitory factor [44]. Topological structural analysis indicated that the core clusters of PPT1 and GPX4 interacted (Fig. 2D), suggesting a potential effect of PPT1 on ferroptosis. In our study, a positive correlation between PPT1 and GPX4 mRNA expression was observed in OSCC tissues (r=0.3690, P=0.0268; Fig. 6A). Moreover, overexpression of PPT1 markedly increased the expression of GPX4 in OSCC cells, whereas PPT1 knockdown significantly decreased GPX4 expression (Fig. 6B and6C). With the FerroOrange (a specific probe for Fe 2+ ), we found the intracellular red fluorescence signal was significantly enhanced in PPT1 knockdown cells (which indicated an increase of intracellular Fe 2+ level) and obviously decreased in PPT1-overexpressed cells (Fig. 6D). Accordingly, MDA level, an indicator of lipid oxidation, was reduced in PPT1-overexpressed OSCC cells and increased in PPT1 knockdown cells (Fig. 6E). Sensitivities to the ferroptosis-inducer RS-L-3 (an inhibitor of GPX4) were compromised in OSCC cells with PPT1 overexpression, but enhanced in PPT1 knockdown cells (Fig. 6F). Thus, we inferred that PPT1 impaired ferroptosis in OSCC cells via regulating GPX4 expression.\n\n**DISCUSSION**\nOur previous study revealed that PPT1 reduction contributed to erianin-induced growth inhibition in OSCC [45], which preliminarily revealed the pro-OSCC growth effect of PPT1. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of PPT1 in OSCC have not been well elucidated. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that PPT1 expression correlates with tumor size, lymphatic metastasis, and the prognosis of OSCC patients. PPT1 obviously promotes the growth of OSCC cells and reduces their sensitivity to ferroptosis via GPX4.  Note: **Former/current smokers were defined as having at least a one-pack-year history of smoking; ***Alcohol intake was defined as current alcohol intake of more than one drink per day for 1 year. Others were classified as having no alcohol intake; *P-values are based on chi-squared or Fisher's exact test. P<0.05 indicates a significant association among the variables.  OSCC accounts for up to 90% of all malignant head and neck malignant neoplasms [1][2][3]46]. Despite recent advances in cancer research and therapy, the prognosis of OSCC has not significantly improved, which has posed a persistent challenge in the biomedical field. Although OSCC is not featured among the top cancers in either China or worldwide [2], OSCC also suffers a lot in terms of quality of life, financial burden, and mental stress as other cancer patients. Therefore, further understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive its progression and identifying more potent therapeutic targets is of great importance. We got 555 DEGs of OSCC from the GEO database and isolated 105 significant genes from the PPI network. Furthermore, these 105 significant genes were used to reconstruct the PPI network and six core target-related clusters were selected, including CFTR, IFI16, GPX4, PPT1, FYN, and FGFR3 clusters. As the topological structure analysis suggested an interaction of the kernel clusters of PPT1 and GPX4, which indicates a potential innovative link between palmitoylation and ferroptosis, we focused on these two items in this study.\n**001).). (A higher resolution / colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).**\nPalmitoylation, a newly identified form of posttranslational protein modification, has been shown to play critical roles in cancer progression, including tumor cell proliferation [28], adhesion [47], migration [48], metastasis [49] and apoptosis [50] etc. The aberrant expression of palmitoylation-and depalmitoylation-related enzymes has been reported in various cancers [18]. Yuan et al. found that deprivation of ZDHHC12-mediated palmitoylation of the membrane protein claudin-3 significantly abolished the tumorigenic promotion effect of claudin-3 in ovarian cancer cells [51]. Kwon et al. demonstrated that APT-1 catalyzed flotillin-1 depalmitoylation, and ZDHHC-19 mediated the repalmitoylation of flotillin-1 for its turnover in cervical cancer cells. The turnover prevented desensitization of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) via endocytosis and lysosomal degradation, thereby causing excessive IGF-1R activation in cervical cancer cells [52]. PPT1, which deacylates the palmitoylated proteins in lysosomes, has been reported to be a promising therapeutic target for melanoma and HCC. Amaravadi et al. found that increased PPT1 expression was associated with poor survival in melanoma [25]. Genetic suppression of PPT1 led to impaired autophagic flux and affected cell growth by the disrupted lysosomal localization of mTOR and inhibited lysosomal catabolism [25]. Moreover, PPT1 inhibition induced the activation of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) /stimulator of interferon genes (STING) /TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) pathway and secretion of interferon-\u03b2 in macrophages, which is critical for the augmentation of T cell-mediated cytotoxicity [53]. Zheng et al. reported that high PPT1 expression predicted poor clinical outcomes and that the PPT1 inhibitor DC661 enhanced sorafenib sensitivity in HCC [54]. In our study, bioinformatics analysis suggested the potential importance of PPT1 in OSCC development. Higher PPT1 expression was identified in OSCC tissues, which was associated with worse prognosis of the patients. Further investigation indicated that PPT1 expression correlated with the AJCC, T, and N stages of OSCC patients. Moreover, we found that PP-T1 promoted proliferation and metastasis of OSCC cells and enhanced the growth of OSCC cells in vivo. Thus, these data confirmed the pro-tumor effect of PPT1 in OSCC.\nPrevious studies on PPT1 in melanoma and HCC have uncovered the importance of PPT1 in the activation of mTOR signaling and autophagy [24,25]. Usually, mTOR moves to approach its activator RHEB on the lysosomal surface, and this process is regulated by the v-ATPase and Ragulator machinery [55]. PPT1 inhibition causes mislocalization of v-ATPase, subsequently leading to the inhibition of mTOR signaling and blockade of autophagic flux due to lysosomal deacidification [25]. Consistent results were observed in OSCC cells in our previous study [45]. Thus, we did not further examine mTOR signaling and autophagy-related proteins here. As increasing evidence indicates that lysosomes regulate iron metabolism to ensure ferroptosis [56,57], and the interaction between PPT1 and GPX4 was indicated by topological structure analysis, we further explored whether there was any relationship between PPT1 and ferroptosis in OSCC. Interestingly, we found that the expres- sion levels of GPX4 and PPT1 were positively correlated in OSCC tissues. Overexpression of PPT1 increased GPX4 expression in OSCC cells, whereas PPT1 knockdown decreased GPX4 expression. With the FerroOrange probe, we found intracellular Fe 2+ level was significantly increased in PPT1 knockdown cells while obviously decreased in PP-T1-overexpressed cells. Accordingly, lipid oxidation, as indicated by MDA levels, was decreased in PPT1-overexpressed OSCC cells and increased in PPT1-knockdown cells. As a distinctly vital enzyme for converting phospholipid hydroperoxides in membranes to non-toxic alcohols, GPX4 is considered and has been proven to be critical in regulating ferroptosis in diseases [33][34][35][36][58][59][60][61][62]. Various shreds of evidence show that targeting GPX4-induced ferroptosis is a promising strategy for disease therapy. Deng et al. reported that quercetin alleviated LPS-induced acute lung injury by inhibiting ferroptosis via the Sirt1/Nrf2/Gpx4 signaling pathway [58]. Baruah et al. showed tannic acid-activated and enhanced GPX4 to mitigate amyloid-\u03b2 induced ferroptosis in treating Alzheimer's disease [63]. Akiyama et al. found GPX4 knockdown-induced ferroptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, exerting anti-AML effects in vitro and in vivo [59]. Xu et al. demonstrated the inactivation of GPX4 in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells resensitized the cells to tamoxifen by increasing ferroptosis-mediated cell death [64]. Therefore, based on the literature reports of GPX4 in ferroptosis and our findings, we inferred that PPT1 inhibited ferroptosis in OSCC cells by modulating GPX4 expression.\nIn our study, we observed the pro-tumor growth effect of PPT1 in OSCC. However, there were limitations. First, in evaluating the effect of PPT1 on the overall survival rate, we did not exclude the potential interference of other diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc. and other therapies like Chinese herbs, various drug intakes etc. More patients and more rigorous experimental design are warranted. What's more, detailed mechanisms underlying the regulation of PPT1 on GPX4 need further investigation.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\nIn summary, we obtained 555 DEGs between OSCC and normal oral epithelial tissues using the NCBI GEO database. By constructing the PPI network and topological analysis, we found that PPT1 and GPX4 might play critical roles in OSCC. Further investigation identified significantly increased PPT1 expression in OSCC tissues, which was correlated with tumor size, clinic stages and prognosis of OSCC patients. Moreover, PPT1 effectively promotes growth while inhibiting ferroptosis in OSCC cells. Thus, PPT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for OSCC. \n**LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS**\n**OSCC**\n**ETHICS APPROVAL AND CONSENT TO PARTICI-PATE**\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital.\n**HUMAN AND ANIMAL RIGHTS**\nThe animal experiments were performed in strict accordance with the institutional guidelines for the use of laboratory animals (The Ministry of Science and Technology of China, 2006) and followed ARRIVE guidelines.\nAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of institutional and/or research committees and with the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2013.\n**CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION**\nAll of the patients provided their written informed consent for us to obtain the clinical samples.\n**STANDARDS OF REPORTING**\nSTROBE guidelines were followed.\n\n\nBackground: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers with poor prognosis in the head and neck. Elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying OSCC occurrence and development is important for the therapy. Dysregulated palmitoylation-related enzymes have been reported in several cancers but OSCC.Objective: To explore the role of palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) in OSCC.Methods: Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and related protein-protein interaction networks between normal oral epithelial and OSCC tissues were screened and constructed via different online databases. Tumor samples from 70 OSCC patients were evaluated for the relationship between PPT1 expression level and patients'clinic characteristics. The role of PPT1 in OSCC proliferation and metastasis was studied by functional experiments, including MTT, colony formation, EdU incorporation and transwell assays. Lentivirus-based constructs were used to manipulate the gene expression. FerroOrange probe and malondialdehyde assay were used to determine ferroptosis. Growth of OSCC cells in vivo was investigated by a xenograft mouse model.\nResults:A total of 555 DEGs were obtained, and topological analysis revealed that the PPT1 and GPX4 might play critical roles in OSCC. Increased PPT1 expression was found to be correlated with poor prognosis of OSCC patients. PPT1 effectively promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion while inhibiting the ferroptosis of OSCC cells. PPT1 affected the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4).\nConclusion:PPT1 promoted growth and inhibited ferroptosis of OSCC cells. PPT1 might be a potential target for OSCC therapy.\n\n",
