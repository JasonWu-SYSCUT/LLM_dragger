    "abstract": "This study investigates the interaction between sakuranetin, a versatile pharmaceutical flavonoid, and monolayers composed of unsaturated phospholipids, serving as a surrogate for cell membranes. The phospholipids were 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE). We conducted a series of experiments to comprehensively investigate this interaction, including surface pressure assessments, Brewster angle microscopy (BAM), and polarization-modulated infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that sakuranetin interacts with these phospholipids, expanding the monomolecular films. Notably, regarding POPC, the presence of sakuranetin led to a reduction in stability and a decline in surface elasticity, which can likely be attributed to intricate molecular rearrangements at the interface. The visual evidence of aggregations in BAM images reinforces the interactions substantiated by PM-IRRAS, highlighting sakuranetin's interaction with the polar and nonpolar regions of POPC. However, it is worth noting that these aggregations do not appear to contribute significantly to the viscosity of the mixed film, and our investigations did not reveal any substantial hysteresis. In contrast, when examining POPE, we observed a minor reduction in thermodynamic stability, indicative of fewer rearrangements within the monolayer. This notion was further reinforced by the limited presence of aggregations in the BAM images. Sakuranetin also increased the rigidity of the lipid monolayer; nevertheless, the monolayer remained predominantly elastic, facilitating easy re-spreading on the surface, especially for the first lipid. PM-IRRAS analysis unveiled interactions between sakuranetin and POPE's polar and nonpolar segments, compellingly explaining the observed monolayer expansion. Taken together, our data suggest that sakuranetin was more effectively incorporated into the monomolecular layer of POPE, indicating that membranes comprised of POPC might exhibit a greater degree of interaction in the presence of this pharmacologically active compound.\n"
