    "fullText": "**| INTRODUC TI ON**\nHigh-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common subtype of ovarian cancer, and patients with advanced diseases are associated with a poor prognosis. [1][2][3] Platinum-based compounds, i.e., cisplatin or carboplatin, are first-line chemotherapeutic agents for solid tumors. While platinum-based therapies have significantly improved the survival of ovarian cancer patients, disease recurrence or development remains a major clinical concern. [4][5][6] Therefore, there remains an unmet clinical need for the development of effective combinations to improve the response to platinum-based therapy in this disease.\nProtein S-palmitoylation is one of the common posttranslational lipid modifications involving the addition of a 16-carbon fatty acid palmitate to proteins at cysteine residues via a thioester linkage mediated by protein S-acyltransferases. 7,8 The family of protein Sacyltransferases have a conserved catalytic domain carrying a zinc finger, Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif and consists of 23 members (ZDHHC1 through ZDHHC24 without ZDHHC10). 9 Protein palmitoylation is known to be involved in a variety of essential cellular processes by altering protein structures, translocation, stability, and function. 10,11 Recent studies have suggested that several ZDHHC enzymes and their mediated protein palmitoylation are involved in tumorigenesis and influence treatment response.

Cisplatin and C75 were purchased from MedChemExpress. 2-Bromopalmitate, H 2 O 2 and N-acetylcysteine were purchased from Sigma. The siRNAs were custom synthesized from GenePharma. Lipofectamine 3000 was purchased from Invitrogen.\n**| RNA sequencing analysis**\nTotal RNA was isolated from SNU119 cells transfected with siZD-HHC12 or siNC using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA-Seq was performed by the Novogene Corporation. The sequencing libraries were created using the NEB Next\u00ae Ultra\u2122 RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u00ae (NEB) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify the molecular pathways correlated to ZDHHC12 knockdown in SNU119 cells using the clusterProfiler R package. In total, 1000 permutations were conducted, and gene sets with a false discovery rate (FDR) \u22640.05 and nominal p-values \u22640.01 were considered significantly enriched.\n**| Data analysis**\nThe relative expression levels of ZDHHC12 (mRNA) across the pan-cancer were analyzed using TCGA datasets obtained from UCSC Xena (https:// xena. ucsc. edu). The tumor-normal comparison was performed by comparing the tumor tissue data from TCGA datasets with the normal tissue data from the GTEx datasets. The high-throughput transcriptome data of TCGA ovarian cancer (OV) were downloaded using the R package TCGAbiolinks. 21 GSE74357 and GSE26193 are published ovarian cancer data obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (http:// www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ geo/ ). HALLMARK gene sets were downloaded from the molecular signatures database (MSigDB), and signature scores were calculated using the R package GSVA. 22 To perform GSEA, 23 Gene Ontology annotations and HALLMARK pathways were tested for (FDR <0.05) using the \"gseGO\" function and the \"GSEA\" function in the clusterProfiler R package, respectively. The correlation between gene expression levels and signature scores was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. In the dot plot graphs, each dot indicates an individual sample.\nGene expression profiling data of cisplatin-sensitive and resistant OVCAR8 ovarian cancer spheroids were obtained from the GEO database (accession number GSE45553 24 ). Normalized values of gene expression levels were analyzed for differentially expressed genes using the LIMMA R package. Log 2 FC > 0.5 and FDR <0.05 were considered differentially expressed genes.\n**| Quantitative reverse transcription PCR**\nTotal RNA was isolated using NucleoZOL (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reaction was performed using the Prime Script RT reagent kit (TaKaRa), and gene expression levels were analyzed using qPCR and a SYBR Green master mix on a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).\n**| Flow cytometric analysis**\nMitochondria ROS levels were measured using the MitoSOX\u2122 Red Mitochondrial Superoxide Indicator (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cellular ROS levels were measured using ROS Detection Reagents (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Apoptosis assay was performed with an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Dojindo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stained cells were analyzed on a NovoCyte Advanteon flow cytometer (Agilent).\n**| Measurement of mitochondrial mass**\nMitochondrial mass was assessed with MitoTracker\u2122 Red CM-H2Xros (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nBriefly, cells were incubated with MitoTracker for 30 min at 37\u00b0C followed by fluorescence microscopy (Leica) or analysis using a NovoCyte Advanteon flow cytometer (Agilent).\n**| Determination of relative ATP levels**\nCells seeded in 96-well plates were counted and assessed using Cell Titer-Glo Reagent (Promega). The luminescence signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present in the cells. Results were analyzed by dividing the relative luminescence units (RLUs) by the number of cells.\n**| Clonogenic survival assays**\nClonogenic survival assays were conducted as previously described. 25 At the endpoint, cells were fixed, stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution, and dissolved in 50% acetic acid. The optical density was measured at 570 nm using an xMark Microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad).\n**| Live-cell confocal imaging of 3D spheroids**\nA 3D tumor spheroid culture assay was carried out as previously described. 26 Tumor spheroid structures were imaged using an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Leica) and scored for 3D structure integrity. Tumor spheroids stained with Hoechst 33342 and DCFDA or Mitotracker Red at 37\u00b0C were imaged using confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP8). \n**| Organoid culture**\nAn organoid line was established from malignant ascites of a moderately differentiated serous ovarian cancer patient who had developed resistance to treatment with carboplatin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel.\nOrganoids were cultured as previously described. 27 Organoid cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo\u00ae 3D Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luminescence signals were measured using a SpectraMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).\n**| Statistical analysis**\nThe data obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies were analyzed statistically using an two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test, and oneway and two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons tests using GraphPad Prism software. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. n.s. not significant. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\n**| RE SULTS**\n**| Correlation of ZDHHC12 expression with redox regulation and mitochondrial metabolism**\nRecent research highlights the critical role of ROS in cisplatinmediated cytotoxic effects. 16 By analyzing TCGA ovarian cancer data using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, we identified ZDHHC12 as the ZDHHC enzyme most significantly associated with ROS-related pathways (Figure 1A), suggesting its potential regulatory role in these processes. Notably, ZDHHC12 expression is significantly elevated in 12 cancer types, including ovarian cancer (Figure 1B). Further analysis using HALLMARK and Gene Ontology (GO) signature pathways revealed strong correlations between ZDHHC12 expression and pathways related to ROS regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial metabolism in ovarian cancer (Figure 1C,D). Strikingly, these correlation patterns were consistent in two independent ovarian cancer datasets (GSE74357 28 and GSE26193 29 ) (Figure 1E,F). Taken together, these findings implicate ZDHHC12 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating ROS and mitochondrial processes that may influence cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer.\n**| Inhibition of ZDHHC12 expression sensitizes HGSOC cells to cisplatin treatment**\nOur investigation of the effect of ZDHHC12 on cisplatin sensitivity revealed that, among six nuclear-localized palmitoyltransferases (including ZDHHC5, ZDHHC8, ZDHHC12, ZDHHC15, ZDHHC16 and ZDHHC23 [30][31][32] ), only knockdown of ZDHHC12 significantly enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in HGSOC cells (SNU119 and OVSAHO) (Figure 2A-C). Furthermore, the knockdown of ZDHHC12 in combination with cisplatin proved to be more effective than either alone, as evidenced using clonogenic survival assays and increased apoptosis (Figure 2D,E). Combined treatment with cisplatin and siZD-HHC12 also induced massive disintegration of the tumor spheroids of SNU119 and OVSAHO cells (Figure 2F). These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of ZDHHC12 inhibition in potentiating the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in HGSOC.\nTo explore the clinical relevance of our findings, we investigated whether inhibition of ZDHHC12 could overcome cisplatin resistance. Gene expression analysis revealed significantly higher levels of ZDHHC12 in cisplatin-resistant OVCAR8 spheroids (Figure 2G), suggesting an association with cisplatin resistance. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of ZDHHC12 on cisplatin response using an ascites-derived organoid line of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer as a preclinical model (Figure 2H). The combined use of siZDHHC12 and cisplatin, but not either alone, significantly reduced tumor organoid growth (Figure 2I). These data suggest that ZDHHC12 is a promising therapeutic target for overcoming cisplatin resistance.\n**| ZDHHC12 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and redox homeostasis in ovarian cancer cells**\nWe further asked whether ZDHHC12 is involved in the modulation of mitochondrial activity in ovarian cancer. We found that the knockdown of ZDHHC12 resulted in pronouncedly increased internal complexity of SNU119 and OVASHO cells using flow cytometry analysis (Figure 3A), indicating increased organelles and metabolic functions within the cytoplasm. As the knockdown of ZDHHC12 also resulted in increased ATP levels (Figure 3B), we speculated that ZDHHC12 may be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function for ATP production. Indeed, inhibition of ZDHHC12 resulted in increased MitoTracker staining as determined using immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis, indicating increased mitochondrial activity (Figure 3C,D). Confocal microscopy analysis revealed higher intensity MitoTracker staining in 3D spheroids of siZDHHC12transfected cells than in those of control cells, further supporting a potential functional link between ZDHHC12 and the regulation of mitochondrial function (Figure 3E). Taken together, these data indicate that inhibition of ZDHHC12 may increase mitochondrial mass and promote mitochondrial function for ATP synthesis.\nTo gain insight into the mechanism underlying the high expression levels of ZDHHC12 in ovarian cancer, we performed RNA sequencing analysis to assess the effect of siRNA-mediated ZDHHC12 knockdown on specific transcriptional changes in SNU119 cells. Significant transcriptional changes were observed compared with the control cells (Figure 4A). GSEA identified a significant association of ZDHHC12 expression with pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function (Figure 4B), mirroring findings from independent ovarian cancer datasets (Figure 1D-F).\nConsistent with these pathways relaying on mitochondrial activity for ROS generation, ZDHHC12 knockdown significantly increased basal mitochondrial and cellular ROS levels in SNU119 and OVSAHO cells as determined using flow cytometry (Figure 4C,D). Notably, ZDHHC12 knockdown further exacerbated H 2 O 2 -induced ROS elevation, which was reversed with the ROS scavenger NAC. These findings suggest that ZDHHC12 plays a role in redox regulation in ovarian cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to regulate redox balance and combat the disease.\n**| Inhibition of ZDHHC12 enhanced cisplatin sensitivity through ROS-mediated mechanisms**\nGiven the association of ZDHHC12 with mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that its inhibition could potentially enhance cisplatin sensitivity through ROS regulation. Combination treatment with siZD-HHC12 and cisplatin significantly increased ROS levels, while subsequent treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC reversed these effects on ROS production (Figure 5A), cell viability (Figure 5B  in SNU119 and OVASHO cells (Figure 5C), indicating a ROS-dependent mechanism. Confocal microscopy in 3D spheroids further corroborated these findings, revealing a much stronger ROS signal upon combined treatment compared with single-agent exposures (Figure 5D). These data provide compelling evidence that inhibition of ZDHHC12 enhances the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in HGSOC cells by potentiating cisplatin's cytotoxicity through ROS-mediated mechanisms.\n**| Inhibition of protein palmitoylation sensitized HGSOC cells to cisplatin treatment**\nNext, we validated the role of ZDHHC12-mediated protein palmitoylation in cisplatin response. The broad-spectrum protein palmitoylation inhibitor 2BP has been widely used to validate the biochemical and biological effects of ZDHHC protein inhibition in preclinical studies. 11,33 In addition, FASN is known to be required for de novo palmitate synthesis, and thus the inhibition of FASN would block de novo protein palmitoylation. 34,35 We used 2BP and C75 to potentially mimic ZDHHC12 inhibition. Indeed, treatment with 2BP, and to a greater extent with C75, significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in the 2D culture and 3D spheroid model of HGSOC cells (SNU119 and OVSAHO) (Figure 6A,B). Notably, the enhanced cytotoxicity induced by the combination treatment was correlated with a significant increase in apoptosis (Figure 6C). Furthermore, while the combined use of 2BP or C75 with cisplatin resulted in a marked ROS accumulation (Figure 6D), treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC significantly reduced ROS levels and abrogated the sensitivity of HGSOC cells to the drug combination, as evidenced using restored cell viability and decreased apoptosis (Figure 6E,F). Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of protein palmitoylation or blockade of de novo palmitate synthesis sensitizes HGSOC cells to cisplatin through ROS-mediated mechanisms.\n**| Inhibition of ZDHHC12 enhanced cisplatin response in vivo**\nTo validate the therapeutic potential of ZDHHC12 inhibition in vivo, we used a xenograft mouse model of SNU119 ovarian cancer cells for preclinical evaluation of cisplatin response. Strikingly, while single-agent treatment with siZDHHC12 or cisplatin showed limited tumor growth reduction, the combination treatment significantly potentiated the efficacy of cisplatin (Figure 7A,B). ZDHHC12 knockdown was confirmed in siZDHHC12-treated tumors (Figure 7C).\nConsistent with the cytotoxic effect, the combination treatment resulted in prominent induction of cleaved poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and \u03b3H2AX in tumors, consistent with oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity (Figure 7D). These data suggest the potential of inhibition of ZDHHC12 as a therapeutic strategy to significantly enhance the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in vivo.\n**| DISCUSS ION**\nOur study reveals ZDHHC12 as a novel regulator of mitochondrial function and ROS homeostasis, playing an uncharacterized oncogenic role in HGSOC cells. Importantly, we used established HGSOC cell line models, SNU119 and OVASHO, chosen for their genomic profiling closely resembling clinical ovarian tumors. 36 Markedly, inhibition of ZDHHC12 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin through ROS-mediated mechanisms, offering a promising therapeutic vulnerability. These findings pave the way for further investigation of ZDHHC12 as a therapeutic target for enhancing cisplatin response and improving clinical outcomes in ovarian cancer.\nRecent studies have reported that several ZDHHC enzymes are critical for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ROS homeostasis. [37][38][39] S-Palmitoylation of substrate proteins mediated by ZDHHC13 has been implicated in liver mitochondrial function and metabolism. 37 ZDHHC3-mediated palmitoylation regulates cellular oxidative stress and senescence in breast cancer. 38 ZDHHC21 regulates oxidative phosphorylation hyperactivity to induce differentiation block and stemness in acute myeloid leukemia cells. 39 It has been documented that high expression of ZDHHC12 is associated with poor prognosis in glioma and promotes malignant cell growth, 40 and that ZDHHC12-mediated S-palmitoylation of Claudin-3 promotes ovarian cancer progression. 41 While previous studies have identified an oncogenic role for ZDHHC12, its potential involvement in the regulation of mitochondrial activity has not been reported until the present study. Our work uncovers ZDHHC12 as a regulator F I G U R E 2 Knockdown of ZDHHC12 increased the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in HGSOC cells.

Data were obtained from GEO with accession number GSE45553. 24    Cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity involves the generation of ROS and induction of oxidative stress. 16,17 Our data suggest that inhibition of ZDHHC12 could be used to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin by inducing excessive ROS accumulation. Notably, this effect is observed not only with ZDHHC12 silencing, but also with the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2BP, 33 a non-metabolizable palmitate analog that irreversibly blocks protein palmitoylation, and with the fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75, which is known to block the de novo synthesis of palmitate critical for protein palmitoylation. 34,35 Importantly, the ROS scavenger NAC reversed the combinatorial treatment effects, suggesting that ZDHHC12-  \n\n\nPlatinum-based therapies have revolutionized the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, high rates of disease recurrence and progression remain a major clinical concern. Impaired mitochondrial function and dysregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), hallmarks of cancer, hold potential as therapeutic targets for selectively sensitizing cisplatin treatment. Here, we uncover an oncogenic role of the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC12 in regulating mitochondrial function and ROS homeostasis in HGSOC cells. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer data revealed significantly elevated ZDHHC12 expression, demonstrating the strongest positive association with ROS pathways among all ZDHHC enzymes. Transcriptomic analysis of independent ovarian cancer datasets and the SNU119 cell model corroborated this association, highlighting a strong link between ZDHHC12 expression and signature pathways involving mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and ROS regulation. Knockdown of ZDHHC12 disrupted this association, leading to increased cellular complexity, ATP levels, mitochondrial activity, and both mitochondrial and cellular ROS. This dysregulation, achieved by the siRNA knockdown of ZDHHC12 or treatment with the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2BP or the fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75, significantly enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in 2D and 3D spheroid models of HGSOC through ROS-mediated mechanisms. Markedly, ZDHHC12 inhibition significantly augmented the antitumor activity of cisplatin in an ovarian cancer xenograft tumor model, as well as in an ascites-derived organoid line of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Our data suggest the potential of ZDHHC12 as a promising target to improve the outcome of HGSOCs in response to platinum-based chemotherapy.\n\n",
