    "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Hyperglycemia is associated with lipid disorders in patients with diabetes. Ceramides are metabolites involved in sphingolipid metabolism that accumulate during lipid disorders and exert deleterious effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the effects of ceramide on glucagon-mediated hepatic gluconeogenesis remain largely unknown. This study was designed to investigate the impact of ceramides on gluconeogenesis in the context of the hepatic glucagon response, with the aim of finding new pharmacological interventions for hyperglycemia in diabetes. METHODS: Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to quantify ceramide content in the serum of patients with diabetes. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of ceramide on hepatic glucose production. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to view cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)- regulated transcription co-activator 2 (CRTC2) nuclear translocation in hepatocytes. Serine palmitoyl-transferase, long chain base subunit 2 (Sptlc2) knockdown mice were generated using an adeno-associated virus containing shRNA, and hepatic glucose production was assessed glucagon tolerance and pyruvate tolerance tests in mice fed a normal chow diet and high-fat diet. RESULTS: Increased ceramide levels were observed in the serum of patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. De novo ceramide synthesis was activated in mice with metabolic disorders. Ceramide enhanced hepatic glucose production in primary hepatocytes. In contrast, genetic silencing of Sptlc2 prevented this process. Mechanistically, ceramides de-phosphorylate CRTC2 (Ser 171) and facilitate its translocation into the nucleus for CREB activation, thereby augmenting the hepatic glucagon response. Hepatic Sptlc2 silencing blocked ceramide generation in the liver and thus restrained the hepatic glucagon response in mice fed a normal chow diet and high-fat diet. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that ceramide serves as an intracellular messenger that augments hepatic glucose production by regulating CRTC2/CREB activity in the context of the hepatic glucagon response, suggesting that CRTC2 phosphorylation might be a potential node for pharmacological interventions to restrain the hyperglycemic response during fasting in diabetes.\n"
