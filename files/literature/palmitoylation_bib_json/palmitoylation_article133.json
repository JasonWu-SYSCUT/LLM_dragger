    "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases. Retinal degeneration causes irreversible death of photoreceptor cells, ultimately leading to vision loss. Under oxidative stress, the synthesis of bioactive sphingolipid ceramide increases, triggering apoptosis in photoreceptor cells and leading to their death. This study investigates the effect of L-Cycloserine, a small molecule inhibitor of ceramide biosynthesis, on sphingolipid metabolism and the protection of photoreceptor-derived 661\u202fW cells from oxidative stress. The results demonstrate that treatment with L-Cycloserine, an inhibitor of Serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), markedly decreases bioactive ceramide and associated sphingolipids in 661\u202fW cells. A nontoxic dose of L-Cycloserine can provide substantial protection of 661\u202fW cells against H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress by reversing the increase in ceramide level observed under oxidative stress conditions. Analysis of various antioxidant, apoptotic, and sphingolipid pathway genes and proteins also confirms the ability of L-Cycloserine to modulate these pathways. Our findings elucidate the generation of sphingolipid mediators of cell death in retinal cells under oxidative stress and the potential of L-Cycloserine as a therapeutic candidate for targeting ceramide-induced degenerative diseases by inhibiting SPT. The promising therapeutic prospect identified in our findings lays the groundwork for further validation in in-vivo and preclinical models of retinal degeneration.\n"
