These findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanism of RAS palmitoyltransferases.\nThe RAS GTPases switch between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. This process is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins 1 . In addition, lipidation adds another layer of regulation to RAS GTPases. Each RAS isoform has a CAAX motif at its C-terminus in which the cysteine residue can be prenylated; after prenylation, AAX is removed by RAS converting CAAX endopeptidase 1 (RCE1), and the exposed carboxyl group of the prenylated cysteine is methylated by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 . Some RAS isoforms, such as human HRAS and NRAS, carry a second type of lipidation-palmitoylation, which occurs on cysteine residues upstream of the CAAX motif 1,2 . HRAS and NRAS localize to Golgi membrane after prenylation followed by CAAX motif processing, then traffic to plasma membrane upon palmitoylation and leave the plasma membrane when the palmitoylation is erased by depalmitoylases 3,4 . Both palmitoylation and depalmitoylation steps are potential targets for the treatment of cancers caused by HRAS or NRAS abnormal activation, as evidenced by the findings that blocking either step disrupts the oncogenic activity of the NRAS G12D mutant 5,6 .\nThe palmitoylation of human HRAS and NRAS has been reported to be catalyzed by a protein complex formed by DHHC9 and GCP16 (also called GOLGA7) 7 . DHHC9 belongs to a family of cysteine acyltransferases that catalyze the covalent attachment of a palmitoyl group (or other long-chain acyl groups) to the side chain of cysteine residues via thioester bond 8 . Members in this family share two structural features that are related to their conserved catalytic mechanism: one is a cysteine rich domain in which a conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) motif has been identified as the catalytic center (thus the cysteine acyltransferases are also known as DHHC acyltransferases); the other is a long-chain acyl group-binding pocket formed by four transmembrane helices (TMs) 8 . In human, 23 DHHC acyltransferases have been\n**Article**\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5 may decrease the binding between RAS proteins and the palmitoyltransferases, thereby resulting in lower palmitoylation efficiency in comparison with that in cells.\nNext, we tested whether the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex could recognize the substrates of each other. For HRAS, only a faint palmitoylation band was detected in the presence of Erf2-Erf4 (Fig. 1f,h), which was much weaker than that in the presence of DHHC9-GCP16 (Fig. 1g,i). Similar results were observed for RAS2, but in an opposite way: palmitoylation of RAS2 in the presence of DHHC9-GCP16 was much weaker than in the presence of Erf2-Erf4 (Fig. 1f-i), consistent with the finding that expression of human DHHC9-GCP16 in yeast only slightly reversed the growth defect caused by erf2 gene knockout 16 .\nThe C-terminal region of HRAS was reported to be sufficient for the correct localization of HRAS in cells, and GFP with its C-terminus fused with the C-terminal 9, 19 or 24 amino acids (a.a.) of HRAS has been used to study HRAS palmitoylation and trafficking [17][18][19] . We designed several chimeric proteins by exchanging the C-termini of RAS2 and HRAS (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). When catalyzed by Erf2-Erf4, the palmitoylation of HRAS was at a very low level and had little increase when its C-terminal 10 or 24 a.a. was replaced by the C-terminal 10, 24 or 35 a.a. of RAS2 (Fig. 1f,h and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b); RAS2 palmitoylation was decreased a lot when its C-terminal 10 a.a. was replaced by the corresponding sequence in HRAS, and was further decreased when its C-terminal 24 a.a. was replaced (Fig. 1f,h). When catalyzed by DHHC9-GCP16, HRAS palmitoylation was slightly decreased when its C-terminal 10 or 24 a.a. was replaced by RAS2 sequence (Fig. 1g,i); meanwhile, RAS2 palmitoylation was increased when its C-terminal 10 or 24 a.a. was replaced by the corresponding sequence of HRAS (Fig. 1g,i). These data suggest that the C-terminus of RAS2 is necessary but not sufficient for its palmitoylation catalyzed by Erf2-Erf4. This finding is different from a previous finding that the C-terminal 35 a.a. of RAS2 were sufficient for palmitoylation in vivo and in vitro 20 . In contrast, the C-terminus of HRAS largely determines whether the whole protein can be palmitoylated or not by DHHC9-GCP16.\n**Overall structures of RAS palmitoyltransferases**\nWe solved the structures of the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex using cryo-EM at resolutions of 3.5 \u00c5 and 3.4 \u00c5, respectively (Table 1 and Extended Data Figs. 3 and4). In both structures, the DHHC enzyme (Erf2 or DHHC9) forms a heterodimer with the accessory protein (Erf4 or GCP16). The overall structures of Erf2 and DHHC9 are similar to that of DHHC20 (ref. 9). Specifically, they all have four TMs, a large cytoplasmic region between TM2 and TM3 containing three anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets that form two zinc finger motifs, and another cytoplasmic region after TM4 containing two conserved \u03b1-helices (Fig. 2a,c,e and Supplementary Fig. 1).\nThe C-terminus (residues 304-364) of DHHC9 was not resolved in the cryo-EM map. In the crystal structure of DHHC20, the C-terminus (residues 297-365) also lacks electron density 9 , indicating that the C-termini of DHHC9 and DHHC20 exhibit inherent flexibility. A truncated form (residues 1-305) of DHHC9 showed catalytic activity similar to that of the full-length DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d), suggesting that the C-terminal region may not contribute to the catalytic activity of DHHC9.\nThe structures of DHHC9 and DHHC20 mainly differ at four variable regions (Fig. 2g,h and Supplementary Fig. 1). First, the N-terminus (residues 9-32) of DHHC9 adopts a loop-like structure; in contrast, the N-terminus of DHHC20 is an \u03b1-helix that is an extension of TM1. Second, the region between TM2 and the zinc finger motifs in DHHC9 contains an \u03b1-helix (\u03b11) and an anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21 and \u03b22), but in DHHC20 there are two \u03b1-helices (\u03b11 and \u03b12) (Fig. 2a). Third, the region between the two conserved \u03b1-helices after TM4 is a loop-like linker in both DHHC9 and DHHC20 but adopts distinct conformation. The fourth is the region after \u03b13 in DHHC9 and that after \u03b14 in DHHC20: in identified to have various subcellular localizations and substrate specificities 8 . The crystal structures of DHHC20 and its complex with palmitoyl-CoA have been reported, providing valuable insights into the structures and catalytic activities of DHHCs 9,10 . In comparison with DHHC20 that functions as a monomer, DHHC9 is unique because it has to associate with GCP16 to acquire its catalytic activity and maintain its stability 7 . The molecular mechanism underlying the necessity of GCP16 for DHHC9 remains unclear. Furthermore, the precise regulatory mechanisms governing the activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex are yet to be elucidated.\nThe human DHHC9 and GCP16 were identified by searching the human genomic database with the protein sequences of yeast Erf2 and Erf4, respectively 7 . The yeast Erf2-Erf4 complex is the first enzyme identified as a DHHC acyltransferase, which catalyzes the palmitoylation of RAS2-a homolog of the human RAS proteins 11,12 . Similar to the requirement of GCP16 by DHHC9, the accessory protein Erf4 is necessary for the catalytic activity and stability of Erf2 (ref. 13). It has been 20 years since the identification of the Erf2-Erf4 complex as a cysteine acyltransferase; however, its three-dimensional structure has not been reported.\nIn this Article, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of both the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex, explaining why the accessory proteins Erf4 and GCP16 are required for the catalytic activity of Erf2 and DHHC9, respectively. We identified a phospholipid that functions as a hub to hold TM2, TM3 and a type II polyproline (PPII) helix of DHHC9 together. We also identified palmitoylation modifications at three cysteine residues in DHHC9, mutations of which significantly decreased the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex. Additionally, we found that GCP16 also functions as an accessory protein for DHHC14 and DHHC18, and DHHC14 and DHHC18 in complex with GCP16 could also catalyze RAS palmitoylation.\n\n**Results**\n**Substrate specificity of RAS palmitoyltransferase**\nWe overexpressed the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex in insect cells and in Expi293F cells, respectively, and purified them to homogeneity (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). The ratio of zinc ions to DHHC9 in the DHHC9-GCP16 complex was close to 2 (Extended Data Fig. 1c). To evaluate their palmitoyltransferase activities, we used a fluorescent analog of palmitoyl-CoA (N-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4 -yl)-methyl]amino palmitoyl-CoA, NBD-palmitoyl-CoA) as the palmitoyl group donor 14 , and used yeast RAS2 and human HRAS (and NRAS) as the substrates of Erf2 and DHHC9, respectively. At specified time points, the reactions were terminated and analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The SDS-PAGE gel was initially examined using fluorescent imaging to measure the NBD fluorescence signal, and then stained with Coomassie blue to determine the protein sample loads (Fig. 1). Palmitoylation of RAS2 was observed in the presence of the wild type but not the C203A catalytic dead mutant of Erf2 in complex with Erf4 (Fig. 1a,c). C318 is the palmitoylation site in RAS2, downstream of which is the CAAX motif 15 . The C318A mutation decreased the palmitoylation level of RAS2, but a weak NBD signal was still observed, which may be due to the palmitoylation of C319 in the CAAX motif (Fig. 1a,c). Similarly, palmitoylation of HRAS and NRAS was observed in the presence of the wild type but not the C169A catalytic dead mutant of DHHC9 in complex with GCP16 (Fig. 1b,d and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). C181 and C184 in HRAS, and C181 in NRAS, are the sites undergoing palmitoylation 2 ; mutations of these cysteine residues to serine substantially decreased the palmitoylation level of HRAS and NRAS (Fig. 1b,d and Extended Data Fig. 1d,e). These results confirmed the catalytic activities of the purified RAS palmitoyltransferases. It should be noted that the RAS proteins used in these assays were recombinantly expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, and they were not prenylated. The lack of prenylation Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5 DHHC9 there is a PPII helix followed by a loop structure, but in DHHC20 there is a short \u03b1-helix followed by a loop structure with a distinct orientation (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Fig. 1). The four variable regions in DHHC9, especially variable regions 1, 2 and 4, are important for the formation and function of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex, which will be discussed later.\nThe accessory proteins Erf4 and GCP16 have no TM, but both have two \u03b1 helices inserted into the membrane (\u03b15\u2032 and \u03b16\u2032 in Erf4; \u03b12\u2032 and \u03b13\u2032 in GCP16) (Fig. 2b,d). Interestingly, the two helices are at a position similar to that of helix \u03b15 in DHHC20 (Fig. 2f), which may partially explain why accessory proteins are required by Erf2 and DHHC9, but not DHHC20. The double mutation W278A/L279A in DHHC20 helix \u03b15   andc) and that of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex (b and d) were evaluated using RAS2 and HRAS as the protein substrates, respectively, and using the NBD-palmitoyl-CoA as a substitute of palmitoyl-CoA. e, The linear diagrams of the chimeric RAS proteins. The chimeric protein HRAS-RAS2 (10 a.a.) or HRAS-RAS2 (24 a.a.) was generated by replacing the C-terminal 10 a.a. or 24 a.a. of HRAS with that of RAS2; similarly, the chimeric protein RAS2-HRAS (10 a.a.) or RAS2-HRAS (24 a.a.) was generated by replacing the C-terminal 10 or 24 a.a. of RAS2 with that of HRAS. f-i, The substrate specificity of the Erf2-Erf4 complex (f and h) and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex (g and i) were evaluated using chimeric RAS proteins. The data are the results of a representative experiment from three independent experiments (a, b, f and g): the SDS-PAGE gels imaged by fluorescence imaging, representing the NBD-palmitoylation level (top), and the same gels visualized by Coomassie blue staining (bottom); the bands of RAS2 and HRAS indicated by asterisks were the dimers of RAS2 and HRAS, respectively. The data in c, d, h and i, which represent the mean \u00b1 s.d. of three independent measurements, were analyzed using Prism.\n**Article**\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5 decreased the autoacylation activity of DHHC20 by about half 9 , supporting the importance of this membrane-inserted helix.\nErf4 and GCP16 also share other structural features. Both of them contain anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets formed by three \u03b2-strands (\u03b21\u2032, \u03b25\u2032 and \u03b24\u2032 in Erf4; \u03b21\u2032, \u03b23\u2032 and \u03b22\u2032 in GCP16), and two \u03b1-helices in the cytoplasmic region (\u03b14\u2032 and \u03b17\u2032 in Erf4; \u03b11\u2032 and \u03b14\u2032 in GCP16) (Fig. 2b,d and Supplementary Fig. 2).\n**Structures of the active sites and zinc finger motifs**\nThe core of the active site of DHHC acyltransferases is the conserved DHHC motif, in which the cysteine residue can accept an acyl group from acyl-CoA and then transfer it to cysteine residues in substrate proteins 8,9 . In the cryo-EM maps of Erf2 and DHHC9, densities for aliphatic chain-like structures linked to the catalytic cysteines in the DHHC motifs were observed, although no acyl-CoA was added during protein purification and cryo-EM sample preparation. The acyl groups in both structures are located behind solvent-accessible surfaces (Extended Data Fig. 5a,d). The carbonyl oxygen of the acyl group forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with the first histidine (H201 in Erf2; H167 in DHHC9) in the DHHC motif. A saturated 14-carbon acyl group fit better than a 16-carbon acyl group in the density maps (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 5). Despite that, autoacylation assays demonstrated that the Erf2-Erf4 complex favored acyl-CoA with chain lengths of 16 and 18 carbons as substrates, whereas the DHHC9-GCP16 complex preferred 16-carbon acyl-CoA (Fig. 3c,d).\nThe good quality of the cryo-EM maps of DHHC9 and Erf2 (Supplementary Figs. 3 and4) enables us to analyze the interactions between the acyl groups and their respective binding pockets. In both Erf2 and DHHC9, the acyl group binding pockets consist mainly of hydrophobic residues from TM1, TM3 and TM4 (Fig. 3a,b). Residues close to the catalytic cysteine are highly conserved among Erf2, DHHC9 and DHHC20 (residues W171, V172, F184 and L242 in DHHC9 and the corresponding residues in Erf2 and DHHC20) (Supplementary Fig. 1). In contrast, residues surrounding the acyl chain tail display diversity (Fig. 3e,f).\nThe DHHC motif is part of the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that contains two zinc finger motifs (Fig. 4a,d). The well-organized structure of the CRD enables the DHHC motif to adopt the right conformation to place the catalytic cysteine and the first histidine in the DHHC motif at the right position. Residues in the CRD are conserved among Erf2, DHHC9 and DHHC20 (Supplementary Fig. 1). Each zinc finger motif has three cysteine residues and one histidine to coordinate a zinc ion. Disruption of the zinc finger motifs leads to a loss of function of the DHHC enzymes. The R148W mutation in DHHC9 identified in XLID patients was reported to affect the autoacylation of DHHC9 (ref. 16). We confirmed it in our assay (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c). Mutation of R148 to a bulky residue may disrupt the zinc-binding site formed by C141, C144, H154 and C161 (Fig. 4d).\nThe zinc finger motifs are stabilized by the surrounding structures. In both Erf2 and DHHC9, there are intense hydrogen bonding interactions between the zinc-binding motifs and helix \u03b12 (Fig. 4a,b,d,e). In addition, the linkers between TM2 and helix \u03b11 in both Erf2 and DHHC9 hold the zinc finger motifs together through hydrogen bonding (Fig. 4c,f). In DHHC9, variable region 1 also stabilizes the zinc finger motifs: residues R20, N21 and A32 in variable region 1 form five H-bonds with the main chains of S156, I157, C158 and G173 and the side chain of N160 (Fig. 4d). The R20E mutation decreased the activity of DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. 6b,d), supporting the importance of variable region 1.\n**Interactions between DHHC9 and its accessory protein GCP16**\nDHHC9 interacts with GCP16 mainly through four interfaces (Fig. 5a). One is between TM2, TM3 of DHHC9 and \u03b13\u2032 helix of GCP16 (Fig. 5b). The side chain of R85 in DHHC9 TM2 donates a H-bond to the main chain of Y76 in GCP16 \u03b13\u2032 helix; Y183 in DHHC9 TM3 interacts with Y76 in GCP16 \u03b13\u2032 helix through \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. Mutation of either DHHC9 R85 or GCP16 Y76 to alanine decreased the catalytic activity of DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. 6e,g). The second is between the PPII helix of DHHC9 and GCP16 (Fig. 5c). P290 and P293 in the PPII helix dock into two weakly negatively charged pockets formed by \u03b11\u2032-\u03b12\u2032 and \u03b14\u2032-\u03b15\u2032 helices of GCP16, while P292 in the PPII helix form a CH-\u03c0 hydrogen bond with Y86 in GCP16 \u03b13\u2032 helix 21 . The first and second interfaces stabilize DHHC9 by holding its TM2, TM3 and the PPII helix together. The third is between the zinc finger motifs of DHHC9 and the loop following the \u03b21\u2032 strand of GCP16 (Fig. 5d). P150 and F129 in DHHC9 interact with GCP16 Y18 through CH-\u03c0 interaction and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, respectively; DHHC9 E163 interacts with GCP16 R16 through chargecharge interaction. The importance of DHHC9 P150 is consistent with the identification of P150S mutation as a cause of X-linked intellectual disorders (XLIDs) 16 . The DHHC9 P150S mutant had a decreased autopalmitoylation level and lost its catalytic activity (Extended Data Fig. 6a,c). The fourth interface is between DHHC9 \u03b11 helix and GCP16 (Fig. 5e). DHHC9 D100 interacts with K11 and F13 in GCP16 through charge-charge and anion-\u03c0 interactions, respectively; DHHC9 E101 interacts with R118 and R121 in GCP16 through charge-charge interaction and H-bond, respectively; in addition, DHHC9 F104 forms \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking with GCP16 F13. The fourth interface stabilizes DHHC9 \u03b11 helix, thus indirectly stabilizing the linker between TM2 and the \u03b11 helix that interacts with the zinc finger motifs through H-bonds (Fig. 4f). Taken together, the third and fourth interfaces stabilize the zinc finger motifs of DHHC9.\nAn important finding in the DHHC9-GCP16 structure is the presence of a lipid-like molecule around a positively charged patch formed by R85, R179 and R298 in DHHC9 (Fig. 5b). Based on the cryo-EM density, we docked a phosphatidic acid (PA)(12:0/12:0) into the structure. The phosphate group and the carbonyl oxygen of one of the two lauroyl groups of PA(12:0/12:0) interacts with R85, R179 and R298 through charge-charge interactions and H-bonds; R179 donates a hydrogen bond to the main chain of DHHC9 P292. Consistent with this observation, the R85A and R298E mutations decreased the catalytic activity of DHHC9. The R298E mutation also decreased the autopalmitoylation level of DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. 6e-h). These data suggest that the phospholipid functions as a hub to stabilize the conformation of TM2, TM3 and the PPII helix of DHHC9.\nTo determine whether the DHHC9-GCP16 complex indeed contains phospholipid species, we extracted small molecules from the purified protein samples and performed mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. As structural analysis indicated the lipid density appearing to be a PA species, we mapped the detected ions towards known PA species, and identified 20 PA species including PA ). However, we cannot rule out potential nonspecific lipid association during protein purification. Therefore, we further evaluated the impact of different phospholipids on the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). Upon washing with Triton X-100 to remove the bound lipids, the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex exhibited a decrease, which was partially restored by adding PA, but not phosphatidylcholines. These results provide additional support for the notion that PA plays a role in stabilizing the DHHC9-GCP16 complex.\nThe interactions between Erf2 and Erf4 share similar pattern with that between DHHC9 and GCP16, suggesting a conserved binding mode across species (Extended Data Fig. 8). view (e) and the lateral view (f) of the overall structure of DHHC20 (PDB code: 6BMN). g,h, Alignment of the cryo-EM structure of DHHC9 in the DHHC9-GCP16 complex with the crystal structure of DHHC20 to identify regions that have distinct structures in DHHC9 and DHHC20 (defined here as variable regions). DHHC9 is colored gray, with the variable regions 1, 2, 3 (g) and 4 (h) in it colored magenta; DHHC20 is colored yellow, with the variable regions in it colored cyan.\n**Article**\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5\n**Palmitoylation regulates DHHC9 activity**\nIn the cryo-EM map of DHHC9, there are extra densities linked to the side chains of C24, C25 and C288, and the shape of the densities indicates that these cysteine residues were modified by acyl groups (Fig. 6a,b). Using MS, we identified palmitoylation at both C25 and C288 (Extended Data Fig. 9); though no palmitoylation at C24 was identified, a palmitoyl group covalently linked to C24 matches well with the cryo-EM density (Fig. 6a).\nC24 and C25 are located in variable region 1 of DHHC9, which interacts with multiple other regions in DHHC9 (Fig. 6a). Firstly, the  side chain of T22 and the carbonyl oxygen of the palmitoyl group attached to C24 form H-bonds with the side chain of K35 at the N-terminus of TM1; the main chain of M30 accepts an H-bond from the main chain of F88 in TM2. Secondly, variable region 1 interacts with the zinc finger motifs (Fig. 4d). Thirdly, T11, R12, K13 and D26 in variable region 1 form H-bonds with residues D297, R298, R299, G300 and L302, thus keeping DHHC9 PPII helix at a proper position to facilitate its interaction with GCP16 (Fig. 6c). Palmitoylation of C24 and C25 anchors variable region 1 to the lipid bilayer, stabilizing its conformation and enabling it to interact with multiple regions in DHHC9. Supporting the structure observation, the C24A/C25A double mutation severely decreased the catalytic activity of DHHC9 (Fig. 6d,e).\nC288 at the C-terminus of DHHC9 \u03b13 helix is surrounded by TM2 and TM3 of DHHC9 and helix \u03b12\u2032 of GCP16 (Fig. 6b). The palmitoyl group attached to C288 inserts into the lipid bilayer and docks into a hydrophobic pocket between TM2 and TM3 to bring DHHC9 \u03b13 helix close to TM2 and TM3. The C288A mutant lost the activity to catalyze HRAS palmitoylation (Fig. 6d,e). C288 is at the center of a cysteine cluster including C283, C284 and C288 in DHHC9 and C69 and C72 in GCP16 \u03b12\u2032 helix. The catalytic activities of the C283A and C284A mutants were either slightly decreased or similar to that of wild-type DHHC9 (Fig. 6d-f), but the double mutations C69A/C72A in GCP16 decreased the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex by about 70% (Extended Data Fig. 6e,g). Although we did not observe palmitoylation at C69 or C72 of GCP16 in our MS data, a previous study showed that both cysteine residues were palmitoylated, and that the C69A/C72A double mutant could not localize to the Golgi 22 . These findings indicate that cysteine palmitoylation plays a crucial role in the membrane attachment of the DHHC9 \u03b13 helix and GCP16 \u03b12\u2032 helix and is vital for maintaining the stability of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex.\n**GCP16 is an accessory protein for DHHC14 and DHHC18**\nAlignment of the protein sequences of the 23 human DHHCs shows that DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC5 and DHHC8 are most closely related to DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. 10a). A PPII helix in DHHC9 is located at the center of the DHHC9-GCP16 interface. We speculate that this PPII helix is a unique feature of DHHCs that require accessory proteins similar to GCP16. P290 and P293 in this PPII helix are conserved in Erf2 but not in DHHC20, and also conserved in DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC8 and DHHC19. The residue in DHHC5 corresponding to DHHC9 P290 is S247, but after S247, there is a proline residue (Extended Data Fig. 10b). The alignment suggests that DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC8, DHHC5 and DHHC19 may also require GCP16-like accessory proteins. Indeed, GCP16 has been reported to form complexes with DHHC5 and DHHC8  (ref. 23). A homolog of GCP16-GOLGA7B-also interacts with DHHC5 to regulate its function 24 .\nTo test whether DHHC14 and DHHC18 can form complexes with GCP16, we transiently expressed them alone or together with GCP16 in Expi293F cells. As anticipated, DHHC14 and DHHC18 were found to be co-purified with GCP16 (Fig. 7a,b). We also co-expressed DHHC19 with GCP16 in Expi293F cells, but unfortunately, no target protein was obtained after purification. Both DHHC14 and DHHC18 in complex with GCP16 can catalyze NRAS palmitoylation (Fig. 7c,d), and prefer acyl-CoA with a chain length of 16 carbons (Fig. 7e,f). The catalytic activity of DHHC14 against NRAS was weaker than that of DHHC9 (Fig. 7c,d). These data suggest that GCP16 is a universal accessory protein for DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18, and DHHC14 and DHHC18 may be involved in RAS palmitoylation.\nNext, we assessed the activities of DHHC14 and DHHC18 to palmitoylate NRAS in HEK 293T cells. We employed small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down the expression of DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18 (Fig. 7g), then transiently expressed NRAS, which carried an activating mutation (Q61R) and had an HA-tag at its N-terminus. Subsequently, we evaluated the palmitoylation level of the NRAS(Q61R) mutant using click chemistry (Fig. 7h). The double mutant NRAS(Q61R/C181S) was used as a control to mimic the depalmitoylated state of NRAS(Q61R). Knockdown of any of DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18 led to a reduction in NRAS(Q61R) palmitoylation, with knockdown of DHHC9 exhibiting a more pronounced effect. The distribution of NRAS(Q61R) was altered upon knockdown of DHHC9, DHHC14 or DHHC18 (Fig. 7i). As observed in the previous studies 3,4 , NRAS exhibited localization to both the Golgi membrane and plasma membrane. Substitution of C181 in NRAS with serine resulted in a loss of membrane localization. Knockdown of DHHC9, DHHC14 or DHHC18 led to a redistribution of NRAS(Q61R) from the membrane to the cytoplasm (Fig. 7i). Collectively, these findings suggest that DHHC14 and DHHC18 can catalyze the palmitoylation of NRAS in HEK 293T cells.\n\n**Discussion**\nA two-step ping-pong catalytic mechanism has been proposed for the DHHC acyltransferases: the acyl group is first transferred from acyl-CoA to the catalytic cysteines and then transferred to cysteine residues in substrate proteins 25,26 . The structures of DHHC20 in the lipid-free state, the covalent inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate-bound state and the palmitoyl-CoA-bound state have been solved 9,10 . The Erf2-Erf4 and the DHHC9-GCP16 complexes in our structures have their catalytic cysteines modified by an acyl group. To the best of our knowledge, our structures represent the first autoacylated structures of DHHCs (Fig. 3a,b).\nThe importance of acylation in RAS signaling has been known for more than 30 years (ref.\n2); however, the mechanism for the regulation of RAS acylation is poorly understood. Many of the 23 human DHHCs function as monomers, but some have accessory proteins 27 . The requirement of GCP16 by DHHC9 has been demonstrated by previous studies 7,16 . Our structures show that GCP16 (or Erf4) binds to a surface of DHHC9 (or Erf2) that is opposite to the DHHC motif (Fig. 2a-d), suggesting that GCP16 and Erf4 are not directly involved in the catalytic process, but stabilize the architecture of DHHC9 and Erf2, respectively. Furthermore, our study and previous studies 23 demonstrate that GCP16 is an accessory protein for at least 5 of the 23 human DHHC acyltransferases (DHHC5, DHHC8, DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18), indicating that GCP16 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of DHHC acyltransferases.\nIn the cryo-EM structure of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex, we identified a phospholipid binding to three arginine residues in DHHC9  (Fig. 5a). Among the three arginine residues, R85 is conserved only in DHHC14; R179 is conserved in DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC8, DHHC5 and DHHC19; R298 is conserved in DHHC14, DHHC18 and DHHC5 (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Therefore, we speculate that at least DHHC14 also binds to a phospholipid similar to that in DHHC9. We built a PA(12:0/12:0) into the cryo-EM structure of DHHC9. However, other PAs are also possible, since our data show that several PAs, including PA(12:0/12:0), PA(14:0/14:0), PA(18:1/18:1) and PA(16:0/18:1), could restore the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex decreased by removing the bound lipids (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f). We cannot exclude the possibility that the bound phospholipid could be ceramide phosphates, which may also provide a phosphate group to interact with the arginine residues in DHHC9. It is worth testing whether the phospholipid is a constitutive component of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex or plays a regulatory role.\nAnother interesting finding is the palmitoylation of three cysteine residues in DHHC9. Among these cysteine residues, C25 is conserved in DHHC14 and DHHC18, while C288 is conserved in DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC8, DHHC5 and DHHC19, suggesting a conserved role of cysteine palmitoylation in the regulation of DHHCs. In consistency with our finding, the corresponding residue of C288 in DHHC5, C245, was reported to be palmitoylated together with C236 and C237 in DHHC5 (ref. 28), and mutating the three cysteine residues to serine or alanine disrupted the interaction between DHHC5 and GCP16 or GOL-GA7B 23,24 . It is not clear whether the palmitoylation of C24, C25 and C288 in DHHC9 is a nonenzymatic event or catalyzed by DHHC9 or other DHHCs. The only palmitoylation cascade reported so far is the palmitoylation of DHHC6 by DHHC16 (ref. 29). Identification of the DHHCs that catalyze the palmitoylation of DHHC9 would reveal more palmitoylation cascades. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5\n\n**Methods**\n**Genes and cloning**\nThe genes of yeast Erf2 (GenBank: NM_001182133.1) and Erf4 (Gen-Bank: NM_001183364.1) were cloned from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C using Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) and put into a modified pFastBac baculovirus expression vector. The construct of Erf2 contains an N-terminal 12\u00d7 His tag followed by a DrICE cleavage site (AspGluValAsp\u2193Ala). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate the C203A mutant of Erf2. The construct of Erf4 contains an N-terminal 2\u00d7 FLAG tag followed by a DrICE cleavage site. The CDS regions of the genes encoding human DHHC9 (ZDHHC9, GenBank: NM_016032.4) and DHHC18 (ZDHHC18, GenBank: NM_032283.3) were chemically synthesized (Genewiz); the complementary DNA of human DHHC19 (ZDHHC19, GenBank: NM_001039617.2) was purchased from YouBio; the gene encoding human DHHC14 (Gen-Pept: NP_078906.2) was codon-optimized and chemically synthesized (Genewiz). The gene encoding each DHHC with a C-terminal FLAG tag was cloned into a pCAGGS vector. The cDNA of human GCP16 (GenBank: NM_001002296.2) was purchased from YouBio. The gene encoding GCP16 with an N-terminal 6\u00d7 His tag was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate the expression constructs of the mutants of DHHC9 and GCP16.\nThe yeast RAS2 (GenBank: NM_001182936.1) gene, the CDS regions of human HRAS (GenBank: NM_005343.4) and the NRAS (Gen-Bank: NM_002524.5) were cloned into the pET15b vector. Each of the expressed proteins has an N-terminal 6\u00d7 His tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site (RAS2) or a DrICE cleavage site (HRAS and NRAS). The expression plasmids of chimeric proteins of HRAS and RAS2 were constructed using KOD One PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO).\n**Protein expression and purification**\nErf2 was co-expressed with Erf4 in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. The cells were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Gibco) to a density of 1.5-2 million cells per mL and then infected with two separate baculoviruses carrying Erf2 and Erf4, respectively. After infection, the cells were cultured at 27 \u00b0C for 48 h, and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (VWR International) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and incubated with 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-\u03b2-d-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) for 3 h at 4 \u00b0C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C, then the supernatant was collected and incubated with the TALON resin (TaKaRa) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. The resin was washed with 15 column volumes of wash buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02% DDM) followed by 5 column volumes of wash buffer supplemented with 25 mM imidazole. The Erf2-Erf4 complex was eluted with 5-6 column volumes of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM and 300 mM imidazole), and incubated with anti-FLAG tag affinity resin (Genscript) for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. After washing the resin with 15 column volumes of wash buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02% DDM), the Erf2-Erf4 complex was eluted with 6 column volumes of elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% DDM and 250 \u00b5g ml -1 FLAG peptide). The eluate was further purified by a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) with the running buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.02% DDM. The peak fractions were collected and used for the acyltransferase assays and cryo-EM studies.\nThe plasmid of DHHC9, DHHC14, DHHC18 or DHHC19 was co-transfected with the plasmid of GCP16 in Expi293F cells (Invitrogen). Cell cultures were grown in SMM 293-TI Expression Medium (Sino Biological) at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 to a density of 2 million cells ml -1 . For each liter cell culture, 1 mg of DHHC plasmid and 1 mg of GCP16 plasmid were premixed and transfected with 4 mg of polyethylenimines (Polysciences). After transfection, the cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h, and collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM \u03b2-ME) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (VWR International) and PMSF, then lysed by a microfluidizer. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 150,000g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The cell pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 1% DDM and 0.2% cholesteryl hemisuccinate Tris salt (CHS, Anatrace), incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C, then centrifuged at 150,000g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was first purified using Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher) and then using anti-FLAG tag affinity resin. The eluate was further purified by a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column with the running buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.02% DDM and 0.004% CHS. The peak fractions were collected and used for substrate acyltransferase assays and cryo-EM studies.\nPlasmids of RAS proteins were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. The cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C until OD 600 reached 0.8-1.0, then at 20 \u00b0C for 1 h, and the expression was induced by isopropyl \u03b2-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside with a final concentration of 0.5 mM for 12-18 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation and stored at -80 \u00b0C. For RAS2 purification, the cells were resuspended in a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) supplemented with PMSF and disrupted by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged with a speed of 25,000g at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, then the supernatant was purified using TALON resin. The eluate was diluted using buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 1 mM MgCl 2 ), then loaded onto a SOURCE 15Q (Cytiva) column and eluted by a linear gradient from 100% buffer A to 60% buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 M NaCl). The peak fractions were pooled, and further purified by a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column with the buffer containing 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The peak fractions were collected and stored at -80 \u00b0C. HRAS and NRAS were purified by following a similar protocol, except that 1 mM MgCl 2 was included in all these buffers, and 5 mM DTT and 0.1 mM GDP were added to the samples eluted from the TALON resin.\n**Measurement of the palmitoyltransferase activity using NBD-palmitoyl-CoA**\nNBD-palmitoyl-CoA was used as a substitute of palmitoyl-CoA. In each reaction, 0.3 \u00b5M of the palmitoyltransferase was first incubated with 25 \u00b5M of the corresponding RAS protein in the reaction buffer (0.2 \u00b5M DTT, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 0.02% DDM) at room temperature. For the DHHC-GCP16 complexes, 0.004% CHS was added in the reaction buffer. The reaction was initiated by adding NBD-palmitoyl-CoA to the acyltransferase-RAS mixture to a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M, and quenched after 10 min (Erf2-Erf4) or 20 min (human DHHCs) using a nonreducing SDS loading buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gels. Each SDS-PAGE gel was first imaged using Amersham Imager 680 (Cytiva) with a Cy2 filter (excitation: 460 nm), and then visualized by Coomassie blue staining.\n**Measurement of the autoacylation activity using a couple-enzyme assay**\nThe couple-enzyme assay was done by following protocols in previous studies 9,30 . The reactions were performed at 30 \u00b0C in 20 \u00b5l reaction buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.8, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% DDM and 0.004% CHS. The reaction components included 0.25 mM oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, 0.2 mM thiamine pyrophosphate, 2 mM \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid, 3.2 mU \u03b1-KDH, 75 nM human DHHC enzyme or 150 nM Erf2-Erf4 complex and 37.5 \u00b5M acyl-CoA (Avanti #870708P, #870710P, #870712P, #870714P, #870718P, #870720P, #870722P, Sigma #P9716). All components except acyl-CoA were incubated in the reaction buffer, then the reaction was initiated by adding acyl-CoA to a final concentration of 37.5 \u00b5M. The fluorescence signals were immediately monitored in a microplate reader (Spark) with an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 465 nm. The data collected in the first 10 min were used to calculate the reaction rates.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5\n**Cryo-EM data acquisition**\nFour microliters of the purified sample at 8 mg ml -1 (Erf2-Erf4 complex) or 6-9.5 mg ml -1 (DHHC9-GCP16 complex) was applied onto a freshly glow-discharged holey carbon grid (Quantifoil, Au 300 mesh, R1.2/1.3). Excess sample was blotted for 3.5 s with a blot force of 0 and was vitrified by plunging into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fischer Scientific) at 8 \u00b0C and 100% humidity. Cryo-EM imaging was performed on a Titan Krios at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detector and GIF Quantum energy filter (slit width 20 eV, Gatan) in super-resolution mode.\n**Cryo-EM image processing**\nFor data processing process of the Erf2-Erf4 complex dataset, a flowchart is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. 3. Movie stacks were motion-corrected with two-fold binning by Motioncor2 (ref. 31), and the resulting 15,626 dose-weighted micrographs with 1.087 \u00c5 pixel size were imported for patch-based contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation by cryoSPARC v3 (ref. 32). All the following steps were performed in cryoSPARC v3 unless otherwise stated. Through first round of particle picking and reference-free 2D classification, 514,743 good-quality particles with box size of 192 pixels were selected to reconstruct an initial model (ab-initio reconstruction job). To remove trash protein particles in 3D classification, we generated four bad references based on the initial model by 'Volume Eraser' in Chimera 33 , which represented outer membrane region only, micelle only, transmembrane region only and without TM maps. One round of five-class multi-reference 3D classification (heterogeneous refinement job) was performed, yielding 195,041 selected particles. However, the transmembrane region density of the good class was still noisy. To achieve a better map quality in the transmembrane region, we applied a strategy called 'noise reduction' to reduce the micelle noise and recover the weak signal of TMs. Briefly, a noise map of transmembrane micelle was generated by erasing signal of proteins in Chimera at first. Then, a weaker noise map was generated based on the noise map by multiplying 0.5 in Relion 3.0 (relion_image_handler -multiply_constant) 34 . Finally, the noise-reweighted map was generated by the origin map subtracting the weaker noise map (relion_image_handler-subtract). Subsequently, five rounds of multi-reference 3D classification were performed with three references (the origin map, the noise-reweighted map and the noise map). After each round of 3D classification, the particles of the first two classes were subjected to the next round. A nonuniform refinement 35 was performed with 123,143 selected particles, resulting in a 3.7 \u00c5 map (Fourier shell correlation (FSC)0.143). To further improve the resolution, a new round of template picking was performed, whose templates were generated by re-projection of the 3.7 \u00c5 map (template creation job), yielding about 9.57 million particles. After two rounds of 2D classification, nearly 2.87 million particles were selected for subsequent 3D classifications and refinements. Similarly, one round of five-class multi-reference 3D classification and five rounds of three-class multi-reference (noise-reduction) 3D classification were performed, yielding 716,030 particles. The particles were then subjected to five additional rounds of multi-reference 3D classification with three references generated by different lowpass filters (60 \u00c5, 30 \u00c5 and 10 \u00c5). Then a nonuniform refinement was performed with 556,792 selected particles, resulting in a final map at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution (FSC 0.143). All the map figures were generated using Chimera or ChimeraX 36 .\nFor data processing process of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex dataset, a similar procedure was applied as for the Erf2-Erf4 complex dataset, and a flowchart can be found in Extended Data Fig. 4. Briefly, 21,926 dose-weighted micrographs with 0.8389 \u00c5 pixel size were applied for patch-based CTF estimation, particle picking and one round of 2D classification, yielding 281,430 particles with box size of 256 pixels. Subsequently, ab initio reconstruction and nonuniform refinement were performed, resulting in a 5.5 \u00c5 map (FSC 0.143). Then, six rounds of three-class multi-reference (noise-reduction) 3D classification and a further round of multi-reference 3D classification were performed, yielding a 3.9 \u00c5 map after nonuniform refinement with 124,470 particles. Subsequently, a further round of 3D classification with skip alignment (relion_refine_mpi -skip_align, K = 5, T = 8) was performed, yielding a 3.7 \u00c5 map after local refinement with 69,051 particles. To further improve the resolution, 17.47 million particles were repicked from the original micrographs, using templates generated by reprojection of the 3.7 \u00c5 map. About 1.98 million particles were selected after three rounds of 2D classification. After five rounds of three-class multi-reference (noise-reduction) 3D classification and five additional rounds of three-class multi-reference (low-pass gradient) 3D classification, 338,978 particles were selected. Subsequently, nonuniform refinement and one round of skip alignment 3D classification (K = 5, T = 4) were performed, yielding 236,228 selected particles that generated a final map at 3.4 \u00c5 resolution after local refinement.\n**Model building and refinement**\nThe initial model of the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex were both firstly generated by AlphaFold2 Multimer 37 . The predicted structures were docked into the density map and manually adjusted in COOT 38 . The models were then refined against the final map by PHENIX 39 in real space (phenix.real_space_refine). The resolution of model versus map was determined by Fourier shell correlation at FSC of 0.5. Statistics of map reconstruction and modeling summary can be found in Table 1.\n**ICP-MS**\nElement analysis was carried out using inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, iCAP RQ) controlled with the Qtegra software package and equipped with an ASX-560 autosampler (Teledyne CETAC Technologies). Internal standard was consisted of 10 ng ml -1 of a mixed element solution containing 7 Li, 45 Sc, 73 Ge, 89 Y, 115 In, 159 Tb and 209 Bi (General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals, China) and added manually. Quantitative calibration and check standards were made using Zn standard (Macklin, 1,000 \u00b5g ml -1 ), Ce standard (Accu-Standard, 1,000 \u00b5g ml -1 ), a mixed standard containing V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Cd and Pb (General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals, China, 20 \u00b5g ml -1 ) and Mg, K and Fe (General Research Institute for Nonferrous Metals, China, 1,000 \u00b5g ml -1 ). The DHHC9-GCP16 complex was diluted to a concentration of 4.7 \u00b5M with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.02% DDM and 0.004% CHS. Both the empty buffer and the protein sample were then diluted ten times with 0.02% DDM (w/v) and 0.004% CHS (w/v) and then subjected to MS detection. Each sample was acquired using three main runs. The isotopes selected for analysis were 24 Mg, 39 K, 51 V, 52 Cr, 57 Fe, 59 Co, 60 Ni, 63 Cu, 66 Zn, 111 Cd, 140 Ce, 208 Pb and 45 Sc (chosen as an internal standard for data interpolation and machine stability).\n**Knockdown of the mRNA of DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18 in HEK 293T cells using siRNA**\nA total of 120 pmol of siRNA targeting the mRNA of DHHC9, DHHC14 or DHHC18 was gently mixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in 500 \u00b5l Opti-MEM I Medium (Gibco), incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then transferred into a six-well plate. HEK 293T cells were digested and resuspended in complete medium without antibiotics and plated into the six-well plate with a 15% confluent density. The cells were then cultured in a humidified incubator at  \n**Transient expression of NRAS in the HEK 293T cells transfected with siRNA**\nThe CDS region of the gene of human NRAS (GenBank: NM_002524.5) was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. The encoded NRAS has a N-terminal HA-tagged EGFP (named GFP-NRAS). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate the expression plasmids of GFP-NRAS(Q61R) and GFP-NRAS(Q61R/C181S). The gene encoding 1-87 residues of mannosidase II (MannII, a marker of Golgi apparatus) with a BFP at its C-terminus was cloned into a pcDNA3.1 vector. Forty-eight hours after siRNA knockdown, the NRAS plasmid was co-transfected with the MannII plasmid in HEK293T cells using polyethylenimine. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were analyzed by confocal imaging, reverse transcription and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and detection of NRAS palmitoylation level using click reaction.\n**Confocal imaging**\nCells were observed with 40\u00d7 objectives on a ZEISS LSM 980 confocal microscope, and images were processed using the ZEISS ZEN lite software.\n**Reverse transcription and qPCR analysis**\nTo evaluate the efficiency of siRNA knockdown, the total RNA of the transfected HEK 293T cells was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Subsequently, 1 \u00b5g of the total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme).\nThe resulting cDNA was diluted four-fold for qPCR analysis. The qPCR was conducted using the Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (YEASEN) on the CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The mRNA levels were normalized using the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis and then transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The Cy5 fluorescence signal was visualized using Amersham Imager 680 (Cytiva) with a Cy5 filter (excitation: 630 nm). After blocking with 5% milk, the membrane was probed with the primary antibody anti-GFP (CST, #2956S) at a dilution ratio of 1:2,000 in TBST buffer (1\u00d7 Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) and the secondary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Sigma #AP156P) at a dilution ratio of 1:20,000 in TBST buffer. The horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence signal was detected using Amersham Imager 680 (Cytiva). Finally, the Cy5 fluorescence signal was normalized using the GFP chemiluminescence signal.\n**Lipid extraction from purified protein samples**\nThe DHHC9-GCP16 samples were prepared in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 125 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.02% DDM and 0.004% CHS. The protein concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Agilent Technologies). An aliquot of 50 \u00b5l protein solution was mixed with 150 \u00b5l of ice-cold methanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, lot no. 220844) in a 2-ml tube and thoroughly vortexed for 30 s to precipitate the proteins. Next, 800 \u00b5l of ice-cold methyl tert-butyl ether (Aladdin, lot no. K2226150) was added into the mixture, and the mixture were shaken for 20 min using an orbital shaker (Mulab) at ~70 rpm at room temperature to enable complete extraction of lipids. A total of 300 \u00b5l H 2 O was then added to each sample, followed by vortexing for 30 s and settlement at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The extraction was centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C (Centrifuge 5425R, Eppendorf). The organic phase of the supernatant (upper layer, ~600 \u00b5l) was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube using a pipette tip, and dried under vacuum using a vacuum dryer at mode V-HV (Concentrator Plus, Eppendorf) for 90 min at room temperature. The residues can be stored at -80 \u00b0C before next steps of analysis.\nFor MS analysis, the residue was dissolved in 50 \u00b5l water/isopropanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, lot no. 207073)/acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, lot no. WXBD4999V) 5:30:65 (v/v/v). After vortexing for 30 s, the extraction was centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants (~40 \u00b5l) were transferred into MS-grade glass vials (Thermo Fisher Scientific, lot no. 0313009) for liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis. This experiment was performed three times using 71.5 \u00b5g, 71.5 \u00b5g and 32.9 \u00b5g purified protein samples, respectively.\n**LC-MS/MS analysis**\nThe liquid chromatography was performed on a Vanquish Flex UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A volume of 2 \u00b5l lipid extraction was separated on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C8 column (1.7 \u00b5m, 2.1 \u00d7 100 mm, Waters) using mobile phase A (water/0.1% formic acid/10 mM ammonium acetate for positive mode and water/10 mM ammonium acetate for negative mode) and mobile phase B (20% isopropanol/80% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid for positive mode and 20% isopropanol/80% acetonitrile for negative mode). The flow rate was 0.3 ml min -1 . The program of gradient elution was 25 min in total and set as equilibrating at 70% mobile phase B for 1.5 min, gradiently increasing to 85% B phase in 4 min and holding for 3.5 min, then increasing to 90% B phase in 4.5 min, linear from 90% to 100% B phase in 3 min and holding for 3 min, then back to 70% B phase in 0.1 min and post equilibrating at 70% B phase for 5 min. The column temperature was maintained at 55 \u00b0C.\nThe mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) was acquired by a Q-Exactive Orbitrap 240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under data-dependent MS2 mode (DDA). The heated electrospray ionization was set to 3,500 V for positive mode and 2,500 V for negative mode. The static sheath gas, auxiliary gas and sweep gas were set to 40 Arb, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5\nExtended Data Fig. 1 | Purification and characterization of the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex. a,b, The Erf2-Erf4 complex (a) and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex (b) purified using affinity columns were further purified by size exclusion chromatography, then the peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining. The protein purification results from representative experiments are shown (a, b). c, Quantification of metal ions in the purified DHHC9-GCP16 complex. The metal ions in the purified DHHC9-GCP16 complex and those in the buffer control were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The data represent the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent measurements. d, Palmitoylation of NRAS catalyzed by the DHHC9-GCP16 complex.\nThe wild-type or the catalytic-dead mutant (C169A) of DHHC9 in complex with GCP16 was incubated with wild-type NRAS or its C181S mutant and NBDpalmitoyl-CoA. At the indicated time points, the reactions were quenched with non-reducing SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The SDS-PAGE gel was first imaged using Amersham Imager 680 (Cytiva) with a Cy2 filter (Excitation: 460 nm) (the upper panel) The curves representing the corrected (random phase initialized), tight mask, loose mask and no mask are colored black, red, blue, and orange respectively. e, Validation of the final structure model. The curves indicate the FSC of the model versus the overall map/ half map 1/ half map 2 (FSC = 0.5). f, A flowchart of EM data processing. Please refer to 'Cryo-EM image processing' section in Methods for details. The map labelled 'good reference' was used to repick particle coordinates and further refinement. The map labelled 'final map' was applied to build and refine the atomic model subsequently. The 3D classes in grey dashed boxes were considered as good classes which were selected during the processing steps. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5\n**Extended**\nExtended Data Fig. 7 | Characterization of the bound-lipid in the DHHC9-GCP16 complex. a, Brief scheme summarizing the experimental procedure for lipid extraction (see also Methods). b, Extracted ion chromatography (EIC) of PA (36:3e), PA (38:4e) and PA (36:4e). c, Data-dependent tandem mass spectrum of PA (36:3e), PA (38:4e) and PA (36:4e). Abbreviation: NL, neutral loss. d, Dot and bar plot showing the normalized intensities (in 71.5 \u00b5g protein samples) of detected phosphatidic acid (PA) species from three extraction and mass spectrometry experiments. e,f, Evaluation of the role of different phospholipids on the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex. The DHHC9-GCP16 complex was immobilized on anti-FLAG beads and subsequently washed with a buffer containing 0.1% Triton X100 in order to remove the bound lipids. The complex was then eluted from the beads by FLAG peptide and incubated with various phosphatidic acids (PA), phosphatidylcholines (PC), or a buffer control. The catalytic activity was evaluated using the NBD assay. The data in (e) are the results of a representative experiment from three independent experiments. The data in (d) and (f) represent the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent measurements. The data in (f) were analyzed using the unpaired t test in Prism to calculate the two-tailed P values: **, P < 0.01; ns, P \u2265 0.05.\n\n\nPeer review informationNature Structural & Molecular Biology thanks Ping Zhang and the other, anonymous, reviewer(s) for their contribution to the peer review of this work.
