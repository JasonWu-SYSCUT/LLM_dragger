    "abstract": "The effects of polyethylene glycol- (PEG) modified lipids and gangliosides on the Ca(2+) induced interaction between liposomes composed of palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) and palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (POPS) was investigated at physiological ionic strength. Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies complemented with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) show that naked liposomes tend to adhere, rupture, and collapse on each other's surfaces upon addition of Ca(2+), eventually resulting in the formation of large multilamellar aggregates and bilayer sheets. Noteworthy, the presence of gangliosides or PEGylated lipids does not prevent the adhesion-rupture process, but leads to the formation of small, long-lived bilayer fragments/disks. PEGylated lipids seem to be more effective than gangliosides at stabilizing these structures. Attractive interactions arising from ion correlation are proposed to be a driving force for the liposome-liposome adhesion and rupture processes. The results suggest that, in contrast with the conclusions drawn from previous solely FRET-based studies, direct liposome-liposome fusion is not the dominating process triggered by Ca(2+) in the systems studied.\n"
