    "abstract": "Salusin\u2011beta and adiponectin receptor 1 (adipoR1) serve important roles in the development of certain cardiovascular diseases and lipid metabolism. However, to the best of our knowledge, the relationship between salusin\u2011beta and adipoR1, and their underlying mechanisms of action, currently remain unclear. In the present study, lentiviral vectors designed to overexpress salusin\u2011beta or knock down salusin\u2011beta expression were used in 293T and HepG2 cells. Semi\u2011quantitative PCR was performed to investigate the relationship between salusin\u2011beta and adipoR1 mRNA expression in 293T cells. Western blotting was used to assess the protein expression levels of adipoR1, adenosine monophosphate\u2011activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl\u2011CoA carboxylase (ACC) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT\u20111A) in transfected HepG2 cells. Simultaneously, HepG2 cells were treated with an adipoR1 inhibitor (thapsigargin) or agonist (AdipoRon) and the resultant changes in the expression levels of the aforementioned proteins were observed. Oil Red O staining and measurements of cellular triglyceride levels were performed to assess the extent of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated that salusin\u2011beta overexpression downregulated adipoR1 expression and inhibited the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, which led to decreased CPT\u20111A protein expression. By contrast, salusin\u2011beta knockdown increased adipoR1 expression and promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, which conversely enhanced CPT\u20111A protein expression. Treatment with adipoR1 agonist, AdipoRon, reversed the effects of salusin\u2011beta overexpression. In addition, salusin\u2011beta overexpression enhanced intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells induced by free fatty acid treatment. These findings highlighted the potential regulatory role of salusin\u2011beta in adipoR1\u2011mediated signaling pathways. To conclude, the present study provided insights into the regulation of fatty acid metabolism by the liver. In particular, salusin\u2011beta may serve as a potential target for the therapeutic intervention of metabolic disorders of lipids.\n",

    "fullText": "**Introduction**\nSalusin-\u03b2 is a 20-amino acid bioactive peptide encoded by the human torsion dystonia gene torsin family 2 member A (TOR2A). The TOR2A gene undergoes selective splicing and translation within the cell, which results in the formation of a 242-amino acid residue, preprosalusin (1,2). Cleavage of the N-terminal portion of preprosalusin produces prosalusin, which then undergoes further cleavage of the signal peptide to produce the active salusin-\u03b2 peptide molecule (1). Salusin-\u03b2 is expressed in the neuroendocrine system, monocytes and macrophages (2). It has previously been reported that salusin-\u03b2 serves a regulatory role in various physiological processes, including blood pressure regulation, heart rate modulation, intracellular signaling, promotion of mitosis and proinflammatory factor expression (3)(4)(5). Notably, salusin-\u03b2 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, a cardiovascular disease characterized by arterial plaque formation (6). Aydin and Aydin (7) employed Pearson correlation analysis and reported that, in a rat model of lipid metabolism syndrome, serum concentrations of salusin-\u03b2 and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were found to be decreased compared with those in the control group, while glucose and triglyceride (TG) levels were increased. These findings suggested a potential association between salusin-\u03b2 and lipid metabolism in the context of lipid metabolism syndrome. Additionally, Chen and Jin (8) reported that a reduction in salusin-\u03b2 inhibits cellular lipid accumulation and reduces cholesterol levels. However, the precise mechanism by which salusin-\u03b2 can regulate lipid metabolism remains to be fully elucidated.\nAdiponectin receptor 1 (adipoR1) is a pivotal component of adipokine signaling and is responsible for mediating the physiological effects of adiponectin. AdipoR1 has seven transmembrane domains (9). However, different from other types of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the N-terminus can bind intracellular adaptive proteins, whereas the C-terminus binds to extracellular adiponectin (9). AdipoR1 activation by binding to adiponectin triggers various downstream signaling pathways that can regulate lipid metabolism. In particular, adipoR1 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and can activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC serves an important role in the regulation of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A), an enzyme involved in mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation (9,10). Impaired fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation contributes to dyslipidemia (10). Therefore, adipoR1 is an important protein involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism.\nBased on the aforementioned biological functions of salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 and their opposing biological effects on lipid metabolism, in addition to our pilot study showing an association between the expression levels of salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1, a hypothesis that salusin-\u03b2 can regulate fatty acid oxidation via adipoR1 in HepG2 cells was proposed. The present study aimed to explore the potential association and molecular mechanisms of salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 in lipid metabolism by manipulating salusin-\u03b2 expression using lentiviral vectors in vitro, to provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of dyslipidaemia and to identify potential therapeutic targets.\n\n**Materials and methods**\nMaterials and reagents.

Stock solutions of 10 mM oleic acid (OA; Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.) and 20 mM palmitic acid (PA; Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.) prepared in 10% fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) were diluted in the high-glucose DMEM (Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) medium to obtain the desired final concentration of free fatty acids (FFAs) mixture (OA/PA molar ratio, 2:1). Oil Red O stock solution (0.5%; Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) was prepared with isopropanol alcohol. The TG assay kit (cat. no. A110-1-1) was purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute.\nConstruction of recombinant plasmids. Based on the human TOR2A gene sequence from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) gene library (NM_001134430.3) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_001134430.3), the nucleotide sequence of salusin-\u03b2 encoded by bases 598-657 was determined. Primers containing restriction enzyme sites and protective bases were designed to target salusin-\u03b2 and the specificity of the sequence was confirmed through Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis in the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/index. cgi?LINK_LOC=BlastHome). The primers used were as follows: Salusin-\u03b2 forward, 5'-CGC GGA TCC GCC ATC TTC ATC TTC ATC AG-3' (the BamH\u2160 enzyme restriction site is underlined) and reverse, 5'-CCG CTC GAG AGG AGG CGC TCT TCC-3' (the Xho\u2160 enzyme restriction site is underlined). Considering the potential off-target effects and poor interference efficiency of short hairpin RNA (shRNA/sh), three pairs of shRNA sequences targeting salusin-\u03b2 were designed using the BLOCK-iT\u2122 RNAi Designer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and referred to as sh-Salusin-\u03b2 1 , sh-Salusin-\u03b2 2 and sh-Salusin-\u03b2 3 (Table I). The sequence structure of the shRNA sense strand was as follows: 5'-'CCGG' (hanging end for AgeI restriction enzyme), salusin-\u03b2 target sequence (21 bp), 'CTCGAG' (loop), reverse complement of the target sequence and 'TTTTTG' (transcription termination sequence for RNA polymerase III)-3' . The antisense strand sequence of the shRNA was complementary to the sense strand, while the 5'-' AATT' sequence served as the hanging end for the EcoRI restriction enzyme. Single-stranded salusin-\u03b2 nucleotides, primers and shRNA were then synthesized. Lentivirus vectors pHAGE (cat. no. 118692; Addgene, Inc.) and pLKO.1 (cat. no. 8453; Addgene, Inc.), envelope plasmids psPAX2 (cat. no. 12260; Addgene, Inc.) and pMD2G (cat. no. 12259; Addgene, Inc.), the pLKO.1-sh-Mock plasmid (containing a non-mammalian targeting shRNA sequence 5'-CCG GCA ACA AGA TGA AGA GCA CCA ACT CGA GTT GGT GCT CTT CAT CTT GTT GTT T TTG-3'; cat. no. SHC002; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) and Top10 competent cells (cat. no. B528412; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) were donated by the Basic Medicine Laboratory at Wuhan Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). The single-stranded nucleotides of salusin-\u03b2 synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. were added to a PCR reaction system containing Premix Taq\u2122 DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc.) and amplified with the primers containing restriction sites (Table II); the thermocycling conditions, agarose gel and visualization methods are described in the subsequent s-qPCR section. The PCR products were then purified according to the manufacturer's instructions of the TaKaRa MiniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit Ver.4.0 (cat. no. 9762; Takara Bio, Inc.), and incubated with BamHI at 30\u02daC for 3 h, followed by digestion with XhoI at 37\u02daC for 3 h. The resulting salusin-\u03b2 DNA fragments were ligated into the pHAGE vector at a molar ratio between 3:1 and 10:1 using T4 DNA ligase (11,12). The double-stranded shRNA nucleotides were obtained through the annealing of sense and antisense strands before being ligated into the pLKO.1 vector using AgeI and EcoRI restriction sites at 37\u02daC for 15 min. After 12 h ligation at 16\u02daC, the products were added to 100 \u00b5l Top10 competent cells, mixed gently, and placed on ice for 30 min, followed by a 90 sec incubation at 42\u02daC in a water bath and rapidly returned to ice for 2 min. Subsequently, 800 \u00b5l LB liquid medium (Biosharp Life Sciences) was added, and the mixture was shaken at 25 x g at 37\u02daC for 1 h. Then, 200 \u00b5l bacterial culture was evenly spread on LB agar plates containing ampicillin (100 \u00b5g/ml) and incubated for 16 h at 37\u02daC in the inverted position. Monoclonal bacterial colonies were then randomly selected as PCR templates, with the forward and reverse primer sequences listed in Table II, and amplified using Premix Taq\u2122 DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc; the thermocycling conditions, agarose gel and visualization methods are described in the subsequent s-qPCR section). The recombinant plasmids were confirmed through Sanger sequencing, followed by large-scale plasmid extraction using the SanPrep Column Plasmid Mini-Preps Kit (cat. no. B518191; Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.), for subsequent experiments.\nCell culture and lentivirus packaging. 293T cells (cat. no. CRL-3216TM; American Type Culture Collection) were obtained from Wuhan Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). The HepG2 liver cancer cell line (cat. no. ECL-0103) was purchased from Enova (Wuhan) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and authenticated by short tandem repeat analysis. Cells were cultured in complete medium composed of high-glucose DMEM (Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37\u02daC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Cells at passages 10-15 were used for experiments and the medium was refreshed every 48-72 h.\nFor lentivirus packaging using a second-generation transduction system, when the cell confluence reached 50-60%, 293T cells were transfected with 4 \u00b5g constructed recombinant plasmid (pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2 or pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2) or the corresponding blank vector plasmid (pHAGE or pLKO.1-sh-Mock), along with 3 \u00b5g psPAX2 and 1 \u00b5g pMD2.G packaging plasmids (mass ratio of the three plasmids, 4:3:1). Transfection was performed at 37\u02daC using the Simple-fect reagent (Signaling Dawn Biotech) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cell supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 h and centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 min at 4\u02daC, then filtered through a 0.45-\u00b5m filter to obtain the viral suspension. The viral suspension was sorted into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf SE; 1 ml/tube), and stored at -80\u02daC. To verify the presence of the target gene, primers were designed for the woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) gene on the pHAGE vector (Table II). This gene is not found in humans and the specificity of the primers was confirmed by conducting a BLAST analysis in the NCBI RNA virus gene database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/primertool. cgi?ctg_time=1699883569&job_key=KSP3XoH-jFarbBxpEQ k4W2sSKWlGATJ0Rw&CheckStatus=Check). Additionally, a forward primer was designed for the U6 promoter in the pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 recombinant interference vector and different reverse primers were designed for the three different shRNA sequences targeting salusin-\u03b2. RNA was extracted from the viral suspension and PCR was performed to amplify the specific fragments of WPRE and sh-Salusin-\u03b2. The successful viral synthesis was initially detected by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently verified by Sanger sequencing. The sequencing results and BLAST analysis of WPRE PCR products are shown in Fig. S1. The specific PCR products of sh-Salusin-\u03b2 1-3 were sequenced and then aligned with the sequence of recombinant plasmid pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 1-3 using SnapGene v6.0.2 software (GSL Biotech LLC; Figs. S2-S4).\nPreparation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) specimens. After collecting the supernatant of lentivirus packaging, 3 ml pre-cooled 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.) was added to 293T cells (confluence, ~100%) in a 10-cm dish. Cells were fixed for 1 h at room temperature, then scraped off from the dish and centrifuged at 600 x g for 5 min at 4\u02daC to obtain cell pellets. Cells were resuspended in ~1 ml of supernatant, then transferred to a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube. Cells were allowed to settle vertically for 1 h at room temperature before the supernatant was discarded and 1 ml pre-cooled 2.5% glutaraldehyde was added. Samples were fixed overnight for 16 h at 4\u02daC. Subsequently, the samples were transported to the Electron Microscopy Room at Wuhan University People's Hospital (Wuhan, China) for further processing. Samples were washed thrice with PBS for 10 min, then fixed using 1% osmium tetroxide at 4\u02daC for 1 h. After three additional rinses with PBS, the samples were dehydrated using an ascending ethanol series (50, 70, 90, 95, 100, 100 and 100%). Following infiltration and embedding in epoxy resin at 60\u02daC for 24 h, the samples were sliced into 50-nm sections using a microtome. The resulting sections were then stained with uranyl acetate for 30 min and lead citrate for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the lentivirus morphology was observed using the JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Ltd.).\nMeasurement of lentiviral titer and MOI. 293T cells (1x10 5 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates and supplemented with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 \u00b5l modified virus and complete medium containing 8 \u00b5g/ml polybrene (Biosharp Life Sciences) to a volume of 2 ml. After 24 h of incubation at 37\u02daC, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. On day 3, cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin at 37\u02daC for 5 min and the resulting cell suspension from each well was divided into two equal parts and seeded into 6-well plates. On day 4, the medium was replaced with either complete medium containing 2 \u00b5g/ml puromycin or fresh complete medium as a control. Cell viability was observed using a light inverted microscope to see if the cells were floating. Floating cells indicate that the cells are dead. When cells in the control puromycin-treated group died, trypan blue (cat. no. C0040; Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) was used to stain the 293T cells at 37\u02daC for 3 min and live cell counting were performed on the treated cells through a light microscope (Olympus Corporation). The 'number of live cells' was calculated for the puromycin-treated cells, whereas the 'number of control cells' was calculated for control cells. The titer of each viral dose group was then calculated according to the following formula: Titer (TU/ml)=(number of live cells x number of initial cells)/(number of control cells x virus volume) and the mean of the six viral dose groups was taken to obtain the final viral titer.\nBased on the reference range of the MOI for lentivirus-infected 293T cells being 1-3 (13), MOIs of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were used to screen the optimal MOI values for subsequent experiments. 293T cells were seeded (8x10 5 cells/well) into 6-well plates and when the cell density reached 80% on day 2 (~2x10 6 cells) at 37\u02daC for 24 h, an appropriate volume of virus was added for infection [volume of virus added/well (\u00b5l)=(MOI x number of cells/titer) x1,000]. After incubation at 37\u02daC for 24 h, fresh medium containing 2 \u00b5g/ml puromycin was added to the cells for selection. Following further incubation at 37\u02daC for 3-5 days, when floating clumps of dead cells appeared, the corresponding minimum MOI value was considered to be the optimal MOI for 293T cells.\nTransient cell transfection and FFA-induced steatosis of HepG2 cells. HepG2 or 293T cells were seeded (1x10 5 cells/well) in 6-well plates 1 day prior to transfection. When the cell density reached 60-70%, a mixture containing 1 ml modified virus (pHAGE, pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2, pLKO.1-sh-Mock or pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2) suspension, 840 \u00b5l medium and 160 \u00b5l polybrene (final concentration, 8 \u00b5g/ml) was added to the cells. The control group was treated without the virus suspension. After incubation at 37\u02daC for 24 h, RNA and proteins were immediately isolated from the cells for gene expression analysis using semi-quantitative PCR (s-qPCR) and protein expression analysis using western blotting (WB).\nTo investigate the mechanism of the regulatory effect of salusin-\u03b2 on the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A signaling pathway via adipoR1, HepG2 cells were first infected with modified lentivirus (pHAGE, pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2, pLKO.1-sh-Mock or pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2) at 37\u02daC for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with either an adipoR1 agonist (10 \u00b5M AdipoRon; Selleck Chemicals) or an adipoR1 inhibitor (1 \u00b5M thapsigargin; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) at 37\u02daC for 24 h, before the protein expression levels of downstream molecules were evaluated.\nTo assess the impact of salusin-\u03b2 on lipid metabolism, transiently-transfected HepG2 cells were incubated with 200 \u00b5M FFAs to induce lipid accumulation at 37\u02daC for 24 h. The control group was treated at 37\u02daC for 24 h with the same volume of 10% BSA solution as the FFA-treated groups.\n**S-qPCR.**\nTotal RNA was extracted from the cells using RNAiso Plus reagent (Takara Bio, Inc.) and quantified using a Nano400 analyzer (Hangzhou Allsheng Instruments Co., Ltd.). RNA was diluted to a concentration of 500 ng/\u00b5l and reverse transcribed into cDNA using Reverse Transcriptase XL (AMV) (Takara Bio, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A preliminary gradient cycle number PCR experiment determined that 30 cycles were optimal for the exponential amplification of the salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 genes. According to the manufacturer's instructions, Premix Taq\u2122 DNA Polymerase was used to separately amplify the target gene and internal reference gene (GAPDH) in different tubes from the same batch. The following thermocycling conditions were used for PCR: Initial denaturation at 95\u02daC for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94\u02daC for 30 sec, 64\u02daC for salusin-\u03b2/60\u02daC for adipoR1 and GAPDH for 30 sec and 72\u02daC for 30 sec; and a final extension at 72\u02daC for 5 min. After amplification, the PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel containing the nucleic acid stain SuperRed/GelRed (cat. no. BS354B; Biosharp Life Sciences) in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer with a constant voltage of 120 V. Subsequently, the gel was visualized using the Tanon-1600 Gel Imaging System (Tanon Science and Technology Co., Ltd.). The cumulative optical density values were measured using the ImageJ software (version 1.52a; National Institutes of Health), before the expression of the target gene was normalized to that of GAPDH as the internal reference gene for relative quantification. The primer sequences used for PCR amplification are provided in Table II. All PCR amplification products in the present study were verified by sequencing and BLAST analysis (Figs. S5-S7).\nWB. WB was performed to assess the protein levels of salusin-\u03b2, adipoR1, CPT-1A, p-AMPK and p-ACC in 293T and HepG2 cells. Total protein was extracted from cells using RIPA lysis buffer (Dalian Meilun Biology Technology Co., Ltd.) supplemented with 1X PMSF protease inhibitor and 1X phosphatase inhibitor. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein quantification kit. Samples were mixed with 5X SDS loading buffer and heated at 95\u02daC for 10 min. Each lane was loaded with 20 \u00b5g protein and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder at room temperature for 1 h, washed with Tris-buffered saline-0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and incubated overnight for 14 h at 4\u02daC with primary anti-salusin-\u03b2 (1:500), anti-adipoR1 (1:1,000), anti-AMPK (1:1,000), anti-p-AMPK (1:1,000), anti-ACC (1:1,000), anti-p-ACC (1:1,000), anti-CPT-1A (1:1,000) and anti-GAPDH (1:5,000) antibodies. After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by additional washing. Meilunbio \u00ae FGSuper Sensitive ECL Luminescence Reagent (Dalian Meilun Biology Technology Co., Ltd.) was used for protein band visualization. GAPDH was used as the internal reference. Measurements of the protein band grayscale values were performed using ImageJ software (version 1.52a; National Institutes of Health). The relative protein expression levels were calculated as the ratio of the gray value of the target band to the gray value of the internal reference protein band. The phosphorylation levels of AMPK and ACC were determined by calculating the ratio of p-AMPK (Thr172)/AMPK and p-ACC (Ser79)/ACC, respectively.\nOil Red O staining. Oil Red O staining was performed to assess intracellular lipid droplet levels. HepG2 cells (1x10 5 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates at 37\u02daC for 24 h, washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and then washed twice with PBS. Cells were incubated with 60% isopropanol alcohol for 1 min, followed by staining with fresh Oil Red O working solution (oil red O dye storage solution/ddH 2 O ratio, 3:2) for 20 min at room temperature. After staining, the cells were washed with 60% isopropanol alcohol for 30 sec, treated with 10% hematoxylin at room temperature for 2 min and then washed with PBS to remove excess dye. The stained HepG2 cells were imaged using a light Olympus microscope (Olympus Corporation). ImageJ software was utilized to analyze the staining area in the images and quantify the intracellular lipid content.\nTG assay. HepG2 cells (1x10 5 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and incubated at 37\u02daC for 24 h. After infection with lentivirus at 37\u02daC for 24 h, the cells were further incubated with 200 \u00b5M FFAs at 37\u02daC for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were treated with RIPA lysis buffer at 4\u02daC for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4\u02daC to collect the lysate. Cellular intracellular TG levels were then determined using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein quantification was performed using the BCA method. Intracellular lipid deposition was assessed by calculating the TG/protein content.\nStatistical analysis. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0; Dotmatics). Each experiment was performed with three replicates, and the mean value was used for subsequent analysis. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test was used to analyze statistically significant differences among multiple groups. All measurement data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.\n\n**Results**\n**Construction and identification of the recombinant pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2 and pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 plasmids.**\nA recombinant pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2 plasmid and three recombinant pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 plasmids were successfully constructed (Fig. 1A). Monoclonal colony PCR results were analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). The PCR product from the pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2 monoclonal clone (78 bp) appeared as a band at ~100 bp. By contrast, the amplified products of sh-Salusin-\u03b2 1 , sh-Salusin-\u03b2 2 and sh-Salusin-\u03b2 3 (298, 311 and 309 bp, respectively) corresponded to bands at ~300 bp, consistent with the expected sizes of the amplified sequences. Sequencing analysis confirmed an identical match with the original sequences (Fig. 1C), which indicated the successful construction of the recombinant pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2 overexpression plasmid and the three recombinant pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 interference plasmids.\n**Construction and validation of lentiviral vectors for salusin-\u03b2 interference in 293T cells.**\n293T cells were separately transfected with recombinant pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2 and pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 plasmids, along with psPAX2 and pMD2.G packaging plasmids, and the viral suspension was collected from the cell supernatant at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 2A). On day 4, microscopic analysis of the transfected cells demonstrated distinct cellular changes, including small lesions, floating granules and cell fusion (Fig. 2B). TEM confirmed the presence of spherical virus particles in the cytoplasm of the transfected cells, which suggested successful packaging and synthesis of lentiviral particles (Fig. 2C). Subsequently, the harvested viruses were subjected to PCR analysis, and the results confirmed the presence of a specific fragment of 98 bp corresponding to WPRE in the pHAGE and pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2 construct, as well as the specific PCR products for sh-Salusin-\u03b21 (298 bp), sh-Salusin-\u03b22 (311 bp) and sh-Salusin-\u03b23 (309 bp) in the pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 1-3 constructs (Fig. 2D). These findings confirmed the successful introduction of lentiviral vectors into 293T cells and the production of functional lentiviral particles.\nFollowing the transfection of 293T cells with the lentiviral constructs for 24 h, the mRNA expression levels of salusin-\u03b2 were evaluated using s-qPCR. Nucleic acid electrophoresis demonstrated a noticeable decrease in the signal intensity of the target bands (78 bp) in the three groups of cells expressing pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 (Fig. 2E). Compared with those in the sh-Mock group treated with lentivirus containing a nonsense shRNA, the relative expression levels of salusin-\u03b2 mRNA were significantly reduced in the sh-Salusin-\u03b2 1 , sh-Salusin-\u03b2 2 and sh-Salusin-\u03b2 3 groups, with the sh-Salusin-\u03b2 2 group exhibiting the most pronounced decrease (Fig. 2F). By contrast, no significant difference in relative salusin-\u03b2 mRNA expression was observed between the sh-Mock group and the control group without lentiviral treatment. These results confirmed the successful knockdown of salusin-\u03b2 mRNA expression by the three recombinant pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 vectors in 293T cells, with sh-Salusin-\u03b2 2 exhibiting the strongest effect. Consequently, pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b22 was selected as the optimal recombinant vector for subsequent experiments.\n**Salusin-\u03b2 expression negatively regulates adipoR1 expression in 293T cells.**\nTo explore the association between salusin-\u03b2 and the lipid metabolism-related protein adipoR1, 293T cells were divided into control and treatment groups before undergoing transient lentivirus transfection. S-qPCR results demonstrated that salusin-\u03b2 mRNA expression was altered depending on whether cells were transfected with the salusin-\u03b2 overexpression plasmid or shRNA plasmids (Fig. 3A andB). There was no significant difference in salusin-\u03b2 mRNA expression between the control group and the groups infected with non-load lentivirus (pHAGE and pLKO.1-sh-Mock groups), which indicated that successful transfection occurred. In the pHAGE-Salusin-\u03b2 transfection group, increased salusin-\u03b2 expression led to a decrease in adipoR1 mRNA expression. Conversely, salusin-\u03b2 shRNA transfection was found to reduce salusin-\u03b2 mRNA expression whilst increasing adipoR1 mRNA expression. WB analysis confirmed this relationship at the protein expression level (Fig. 3C andD). Specifically, salusin-\u03b2 overexpression significantly decreased relative adipoR1 protein expression, whilst knocking down salusin-\u03b2 expression significantly increased adipoR1 protein expression. These findings suggested that salusin-\u03b2 inhibited adipoR1 mRNA and protein expression in 293T cells.\nSalusin-\u03b2 expression is inversely associated with adipoR1 expression in HepG2 cells. Based on the aforementioned results demonstrating the relationship between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 expression in 293T cells, HepG2 cells were selected to further investigate this relationship because the liver is closely associated with lipid metabolism and adipoR1 may serve a key role in regulating lipid metabolism (14,15). WB analysis was conducted on transfected HepG2 cells to assess the protein expression levels of salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 (Fig. 4A andB). These results demonstrated that the overexpression of salusin-\u03b2 in HepG2 cells led to a reduction of adipoR1 protein expression. Furthermore, transfecting HepG2 cells with pLKO.1-sh-Salusin-\u03b2 2 decreased the protein expression levels of salusin-\u03b2 and increased adipoR1 protein expression. These changes in protein expression levels were consistent with those observed in the same corresponding treatment groups of 293T cells, which further confirmed the relationship between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 expression.\nSalusin-\u03b2 regulates AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and CPT-1A expression through adipoR1 in HepG2 cells. To investigate the potential regulatory effect of salusin-\u03b2 on the AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A signaling pathway, the protein levels of p-AMPK and p-ACC, in addition to CPT-1A expression, were examined to assess their modulation by salusin-\u03b2. In HepG2 cells, overexpression of salusin-\u03b2 significantly suppressed AMPK phosphorylation and CPT-1A protein expression, with similar trends observed for p-ACC protein levels (Fig. 5A). However, the western blot analyses showed that there were no marked differences in the total protein expression levels of AMPK and ACC among the treatment groups (Fig. 5A andB). Treatment of HepG2 cells overexpressing salusin-\u03b2 with the adipoR1 agonist, AdipoRon, led to a significant increase in the protein expression levels of adipoR1 and CPT-1A and increased p-AMPK and p-ACC levels, in contrast to the effects observed for salusin-\u03b2 overexpression alone. Conversely, transfection of HepG2 cells with sh-Salusin-\u03b2 2 resulted in a significant increase in the protein levels of p-AMPK, p-ACC and CPT-1A, all of which were reversed by thapsigargin treatment (Fig. 5B). These findings provide further evidence that salusin-\u03b2 could specifically modulate the levels of AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, in addition to CPT-1A protein expression, through its interaction with adipoR1.\n**Salusin-\u03b2-mediated downregulation of adipoR1 promotes lipid deposition in HepG2 cells.**\nTo further validate the impact of salusin-\u03b2-mediated downregulation of adipoR1 on cellular lipid deposition in vitro, HepG2 cells transfected with lentiviral vectors were subjected to treatment with FFAs, while a model group induced by FFAs alone and a control group without treatment were also established (Fig. 6A). FFA treatment significantly increased intracellular lipid droplet formation in the model group compared with the control group. In particular, overexpression of salusin-\u03b2 potentiated the FFA-induced intracellular TG levels and augmented lipid deposition compared with the model group, whereas salusin-\u03b2 knockdown resulted in reduced TG levels and attenuated intracellular lipid accumulation (Fig. 6B andC). These findings further supported the impact of salusin-\u03b2 on increasing lipid deposition in HepG2 cells whilst also highlighting its regulatory role in lipid metabolism.\n\n**Discussion**\nSalusin-\u03b2 is a bioactive peptide that is involved in certain cardiovascular diseases and has been previously associated with abnormal lipid metabolism (16). A previous clinical study reported that serum salusin-\u03b2 levels are positively associated with TG levels and the TG/HDL ratio in children and adolescents with hypertension (17). A previous in vitro study on renal cells reported that salusin-\u03b2 knockdown reduced lipid droplet formation and cholesterol levels (18). In addition, increased salusin-\u03b2 expression has been associated with atherosclerosis progression and elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in a mouse model (19). Despite these associations, the underlying mechanisms through which salusin-\u03b2 can modulate lipid metabolism remain elusive. In the present study, the role of salusin-\u03b2 in lipid metabolism regulation was investigated using both overexpression and knockdown approaches in vitro. The 293T cell line was transfected with lentivirus vectors to modulate the expression levels of salusin-\u03b2, and then the expression levels of lipid metabolism-related genes were examined. The results demonstrated that salusin-\u03b2 overexpression suppressed adipoR1 expression in 293T cells, while a decrease in salusin-\u03b2 levels resulted in increased expression levels of adipoR1. Therefore, in 293T cells, there was a clear inverse relationship between the expression of salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1, which indicated a complex interplay between these proteins.\nAdiponectin is a key regulator of lipid metabolism that primarily exerts its effects through binding to its receptors,  adipoR1 and adipoR2 (20,21). A number of previous studies have reported that adiponectin, through its interaction with adipoR1, serves a pivotal role in lipid metabolism regulation, whereas salusin-\u03b2 has been reported to exert contrasting effects (22,23). Considering the critical involvement of the liver in lipid metabolism and the crucial role of hepatocellular lipid deposition in the pathogenesis of fatty liver and related disorders, enhancing hepatocytic lipid metabolism represents a potentially promising therapeutic strategy (14,15). Consequently, HepG2 cells were selected to be the experimental model in the present study. Lentiviral particles harboring the salusin-\u03b2-encoding sequence or the shRNA sequence were employed to transfect HepG2 cells. Subsequently, WB was conducted to evaluate changes in adipoR1 protein expression. Consistent with the aforementioned observations in 293T cells, overexpression of salusin-\u03b2 significantly suppressed adipoR1 expression, whilst salusin-\u03b2 knockdown had the opposite effect, which further suggested a negative association between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1, in addition to the potential effects on the downstream signaling pathways, warranted further investigation. Further experiments in HepG2 cells were conducted, which also demonstrated consistent alterations in the expression levels of adipoR1 and downstream signaling molecules. In particular, salusin-\u03b2 overexpression led to the inhibition of AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and the reduction of CPT-1A expression, suggesting its potential involvement in suppressing fatty acid oxidation. Collectively, these results provided evidence to support the pivotal role of salusin-\u03b2 in modulating lipid AMPK is a critical regulator of certain metabolic diseases and consists of \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits, with Thr172 on the \u03b1 subunit acting as the main activation site (24,25). Phosphorylation of Thr172 leads to AMPK activation and the subsequent phosphorylation of ACC at Ser79, resulting in its inactivation and reduced malonyl CoA (26,27). Malonyl CoA is an intermediate in fat synthesis, and its inhibitory effect on CPT-1 is a key regulatory mechanism for maintaining the balance of fatty acid metabolism, while CPT-1 promotes fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation to enhance fat catabolism (28)(29)(30). AdipoR1 has been previously associated with the AMPK signaling pathway, with studies reporting its ability to induce Ca 2+ influx, activate Ca( 2+ )/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase \u03b2 and upregulate AMPK expression, thereby promoting lipid metabolism (31,32). Conversely, reduced AMPK phosphorylation is associated with lipid accumulation in liver cells (33,34). Notably, salusin-\u03b2 knockdown in HUVECs has been reported to reverse AMPK and ACC deactivation induced by high glucose (35). Based on these previous findings and those from the present study, specifically the salusin-\u03b2-mediated inhibition of adipoR1 expression in HepG2 cells, it was therefore hypothesized that salusin-\u03b2 may modulate AMPK and ACC phosphorylation, as well as CPT-1A protein levels, through adipoR1, thus influencing lipid metabolism in liver cells. To test this hypothesis, the protein levels of p-AMPK and p-ACC, and CPT-1A expression were examined in different treatment groups of HepG2 cells. WB analysis demonstrated that salusin-\u03b2 knockdown increased the p-AMPK/AMPK and p-ACC/ACC ratios, in addition to increasing CPT-1A protein expression. By contrast, salusin-\u03b2 overexpression reduced AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and CPT-1A protein expression. These findings supported the notion that salusin-\u03b2 can interact with the adipoR1/AMPK signaling pathway, specifically by inhibiting AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and CPT-1A protein expression, by downregulating adipoR1 expression.\nAccording to the data presented in the current study, the inhibitory effect of salusin-\u03b2 on fatty acid oxidation in HepG2 cells was, at least, partially revealed. Significant changes in CPT-1A protein expression in HepG2 cells were observed after the expression of salusin-\u03b2 was altered. CPT-1A is a key enzyme in the mitochondrial membrane that is involved in the regulation of fatty acid transport and \u03b2-oxidation, which in turn regulates intracellular lipid metabolism (26,28). The results of the present study suggested that by inhibiting CPT-1A, salusin-\u03b2 may inhibit the ability of hepatocytes to efficiently break down fatty acids by oxidative metabolism, which may lead to lipid accumulation. Therefore, changes in CPT-1A protein expression may be a potential mechanism by which salusin-\u03b2 inhibits fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes. In addition, Oil Red O staining was used in the present study to observe the effect of salusin-\u03b2 on lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated that after salusin-\u03b2 overexpression, lipid deposition and TG levels were significantly increased in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. This further supported the inhibitory effects of salusin-\u03b2 on fatty acid metabolism in hepatocytes. In conclusion, based on the results obtained in the present study, it could be suggested that salusin-\u03b2 may regulate lipid metabolism by acting on the adipoR1/AMPK/ACC/CPT-1A signaling pathway and promoting the deposition of lipids in hepatocytes.\nBased on the present experimental findings, a novel hypothesis was proposed (Fig. 7). In HepG2 cells, increased expression of salusin-\u03b2 leads to the inhibition of adipoR1 expression. This inhibition of adipoR1 then suppresses AMPK activation, which results in reduced p-AMPK levels. Consequently, the activation of ACC by p-AMPK is diminished, which leads to decreased p-ACC and enhanced malonyl CoA synthesis. However, the increased levels of malonyl CoA in turn inhibit the production of CPT-1A, which reduces the entry of long-chain acyl-CoA into the mitochondria and ultimately inhibits fatty acid oxidation.\nThe present study focused on the regulation of adipoR1 and downstream signaling molecules by modulating salusin-\u03b2 gene expression. Further research is needed to understand the precise mechanism of the interaction between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1, in addition to its impact on the signaling pathway. A previous study utilized artificial liposomes embedded with endogenous membrane proteins to reveal the direct physical interaction between salusin-\u03b2 and the ATP synthase \u03b2-chain, indicating a potential ligand-receptor binding scenario (36). Salusin-\u03b2 may potentially activate undiscovered GPCRs (37). This suggests that there may be a physical interaction between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1. However, adipoR1 exhibits a distinct topology compared with other typical GPCRs, with the C-terminal binding to adiponectin located outside the cell whilst the N-terminal binds to adapter proteins inside the cell (9). Additionally, there may be other signaling molecules acting as intermediaries, establishing connections between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 and influencing the signaling pathway of adipoR1. These specific molecular mechanisms require further investigation. Furthermore, the present study was limited to common lipid metabolism-related molecules. Changes in salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 expression may involve other lipid metabolism pathways. Therefore, further experiments are warranted to elucidate these mechanisms in greater detail.\n\n\nSalusin-\u03b2 and adiponectin receptor 1 (adipoR1) serve important roles in the development of certain cardiovascular diseases and lipid metabolism. However, to the best of our knowledge, the relationship between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1, and their underlying mechanisms of action, currently remain unclear. In the present study, lentiviral vectors designed to overexpress salusin-\u03b2 or knock down salusin-\u03b2 expression were used in 293T and HepG2 cells. Semi-quantitative PCR was performed to investigate the relationship between salusin-\u03b2 and adipoR1 mRNA expression in 293T cells. Western blotting was used to assess the protein expression levels of adipoR1, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT-1A) in transfected HepG2 cells. Simultaneously, HepG2 cells were treated with an adipoR1 inhibitor (thapsigargin) or agonist (AdipoRon) and the resultant changes in the expression levels of the aforementioned proteins were observed. Oil Red O staining and measurements of cellular triglyceride levels were performed to assess the extent of lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated that salusin-\u03b2 overexpression downregulated adipoR1 expression and inhibited the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, which led to decreased CPT-1A protein expression. By contrast, salusin-\u03b2 knockdown increased adipoR1 expression and promoted the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC, which conversely enhanced CPT-1A protein expression. Treatment with adipoR1 agonist, AdipoRon, reversed the effects of salusin-\u03b2 overexpression. In addition, salusin-\u03b2 overexpression enhanced intracellular lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells induced by free fatty acid treatment. These findings highlighted the potential regulatory role of salusin-\u03b2 in adipoR1-mediated signaling pathways. To conclude, the present study provided insights into the regulation of fatty acid metabolism by the liver. In particular, salusin-\u03b2 may serve as a potential target for the therapeutic intervention of metabolic disorders of lipids.\n\n",
