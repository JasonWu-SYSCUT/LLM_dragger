    "abstract": "CD44, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane receptor, plays a crucial role in cell growth, migration, and tumor progression. Dimerization of CD44 is a key event in signal transduction and has emerged as a potential target for anti-tumor therapies. Palmitoylation, a posttranslational modification, disrupts CD44 dimerization and promotes CD44 accumulation in ordered membrane domains. However, the effects of palmitoylation on the structure and dynamics of CD44 at atomic resolution remain poorly understood. Here, we present a semisynthetic approach combining solid-phase peptide synthesis, recombinant expression, and native chemical ligation to investigate the impact of palmitoylation on the cytoplasmic domain (residues 669-742) of CD44 (CD44ct) by NMR spectroscopy. A segmentally isotope-labeled and site-specifically palmitoylated CD44 variant enabled NMR studies, which revealed chemical shift perturbations and indicated local and long-range conformational changes induced by palmitoylation. The long-range effects suggest altered intramolecular interactions and potential modulation of membrane association patterns. Semisynthetic, palmitoylated CD44ct serves as the basis for studying CD44 clustering, conformational changes, and localization within lipid rafts, and could be used to investigate its role as a tumor suppressor and to explore its therapeutic potential.\n",

    "fullText": "**Introduction**\nCD44 (or Cluster of-Differentiation-44 protein) is ubiquitously expressed as a variety of isoforms in adult as well as fetal tissues. 1,2 First described in 1983 as lymphocyte homing receptor, 3 CD44 is now known to act as the main transmembrane surface receptor of hyaluronic acid. 4 Its conserved form consists of three protein domains and is termed standard CD44 (CD44s). Its extracellular domain is followed by a single transmembrane helix and an intrinsically disordered, cytoplasmatic Cterminal tail. 5 The latter is subject to posttranslational modification (PTM) events such as phosphorylation, 6 palmitoylation 7 and proteolytic processing. 8,9 CD44 receptor-ligand interactions usually occur in the extracellular domain, modulating both cell growth and migration in healthy as well as in diseased states. 10,11 In addition to hyaluronic acid, interacting ligands include osteopontin, collagens and matrix metalloproteases, amongst many other extracellular matrix components. 2 The globular ectodomain undergoes significant alternative splicing events, resulting in exon insertion and generation of multiple CD44 isoform variants, which show elevated expression levels in a variety of human carcinomas. 1,12,13,14 Most CD44 receptors exist as homodimers at the cell surface. Both the transmembrane and cytoplasmatic domain of the protein are involved in the clustering of this receptor at the membrane. 15 The homodimers play a key role in signal transduction and facilitate tumor progression, 16 which makes this dimerization process a promising target for anti-tumor therapies. 17 On a molecular level, CD44 homodimerization is stabilized by the formation of two disulfide bonds. The cysteine residues involved in disulfide formation are located in close proximity to each other in the transmembrane (Cys667) and the adjacent intracellular C-terminal domain (Cys676). 8,18 Both cysteine residues can be Spalmitoylated 7 -a PTM defined by reversible attachment of a saturated C16 fatty acid to a Cys residue. 19 Covalent attachment of the lipid, via a thioester linkage to the cysteine sidechain located at the juxtamembrane domains, disrupts the dimerization and higher order structure (oligomers) of CD44 at the membrane (Fig. 1a,c). 7,20 CD44 palmitoylation leads to accumulation of the protein in cholesterol-enriched ordered membrane subdomains, termed lipid rafts. 21 Previously, CD44 has been described as a tumor suppressor 22 as well as an oncoprotein 23 in a broad range of cancers, highlighting its role in oncogenesis. 16 Palmitoylated CD44 located in lipid rafts appears to be detrimental for the migration behavior of breast cancer cells. 16 Therefore, posttranslationally modified CD44 may act as a novel therapeutic agent in cancer metastasis and merits a detailed investigation. 16 Site-selectively palmitoylated proteins are not easily available from natural sources. In nature, protein palmitoylation is often carried out by palmitoyl transferases and their in vitro use can be challenging and often impractical when trying to install a lipid modification on a protein of interest. 19 Furthermore, the purification of lipidated protein from cellular extracts is difficult because of the need to separate it from the insoluble cell fractions. Alternatively, solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and peptide ligation techniques can be employed to assemble proteins with PTMs such as palmitoylation. SPPS offers access to lipopeptides, either by coupling of pre-lipidated residues to a peptide chain or by post-synthetic lipidation of unprotected amino acids such as Cys. 24,25 Preparation of lipopeptides with palmitoylation on amino groups (N-terminal or sidechain) is rather straightforward and can be achieved by direct condensation of palmitic acid using standard SPPS coupling conditions, resulting in an amide linkage. 26 S-palmitoylation, on the other hand, requires finely tuned conditions because the thioester linkage is prone to hydrolysis. 27 In general, during synthesis of lipopeptides, an increasing chain length correlates with a decrease in solubility and poor elution profiles during HPLC purifications. 28 Lipoproteins that are challenging to prepare or exceed the size limit of SPPS (typically ~50 residues), can be derived by peptide/protein ligation strategies such as native chemical ligation (NCL) 29 and expressed protein ligation (EPL; Fig. 1b). 30 Originally developed by Dawson et al. in 1994, 29 NCL yields a native amide bond at the ligation site and is widely used for its ease of application and precision in chemical protein synthesis. 31 In combination with EPL, NCL chemistry enables assembly of semisynthetic proteins, in which a recombinantly expressed protein segment is ligated to a synthetic segment that carries a site-specific PTM. Today's protein chemistry toolbox encompasses a broad range of extensions to NCL, EPL and protein semisynthesis. [31][32][33][34] One of the most significant extensions has been the development of desulfurization chemistry to convert the sulfhydryl sidechain of Cys to the more abundant Ala residue. 35,36 This enabled expansion of NCLbased protein synthesis to a broader range of target proteins. 37 As CD44 is a membrane-associated intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), 38 detailed studies of its conformational properties and dynamics at atomic resolution rely predominantly on solution techniques such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments. [39][40][41][42] NMR can provide access to structures and dynamics of membrane-bound proteins with long and disordered regions, often unattainable by other structural biology techniques. 43,44 Nevertheless, such experiments require isotope labeling of the protein of interest. 45 Biomolecular NMR relies on the spin-1/2 of 1 H, 13 C and 15 N, which can be incorporated by Fig. 1. Domain architecture of membrane-incorporated, CD44 dimer and palmitoylated CD44 monomer and semisynthesis scheme. a) The three-domain structure of CD44 in its dimeric (disulfide bonds at Cys667 and Cys676; orange) and in its monomeric form bearing palmitoylations at Cys667 and Cys676 (orange) is shown. CD44 extracellular and transmembrane domains are followed by a variable stem region (purple) and its C-terminal cytoplasmatic domain (CD44ct(669-742)), which is the subject of our semisynthetic approach. b) Semisynthetic strategy for the generation of palmitoylated CD44ct(669-742). Recombinant expression of CD44ct(690-742) (red) allowed uniform incorporation of NMR-active 13 C and 15 N isotopes. Chemical synthesis gave access to the N-terminal CD44ct(669-689) (gray) peptide containing a single palmitoylation at Dap676 (Dap replaces the native cysteine residue to allow chemically stable palmitoylation via amide formation). Protein segments with natural isotope abundance are shown in grey and isotope-enriched segments in red. c) Amino acid sequence of palmitoylated CD44ct(669-742) highlighting key residues (palmitoylated Cys676 (orange) and NCL ligation site Ala690 (blue).\nsupplementing the expression growth media with required precursor molecules for isotopic labeling. 46,47 Typically, this yields proteins that differ only in their isotopic composition ( 13 C and 15 N isotopologues), 46 and can be used to characterize IDPs. 48 However, protein NMR spectra of larger proteins or IDPs often results in significant signal overlap. Isotope labeling strategies, such as segmental labeling (Fig. 1b), 49 can help to reduce spectral crowding 47 and often make use of protein ligation techniques such as NCL, also allowing incorporation of specific modifications. 47 Here we employ protein semisynthesis to link a recombinantly expressed isotope-enriched protein segment with a chemically synthesized palmitoylated peptide, to give a fully homogeneous modified CD44ct. NMR provides insights into the effects of this PTM on the structure and dynamics of palmCD44ct(669-742).\n\n**Results & discussion**\nTo site-specifically palmitoylate CD44ct and to introduce an isotopelabeled segment, we split the cytoplasmic domain into two segments: a synthetic segment (palmCD44ct(669-689)) and a recombinant segment (CD44ct(690-742)) (Figs. 1b and3a). The synthetic segment allows facile incorporation of the palmitoyl group during SPPS. However, preservation of the native palmitoyl thioester linkage at residue Cys676 is challenging under standard NCL reaction conditions because the thioester reacts with the thiol additive 28 and can hydrolyze during handling and NMR measurements, so we substituted the native Cys676 with L-2,3-diaminopropionic acid (Dap) to form a stable amide linkage between sidechain and palmitoyl moiety. The recombinant segment was expressed with a hexa-histidine tag (6xHis) at the C-terminus for purification purposes. The N-terminal methionine was removed by the methionyl-aminopeptidases present in the E. coli expression strain, thereby releasing the N-terminal cysteine required for ligation. NCL to the synthetic segment provided access to a homogeneous palmitoylated 13 C and 15 N isotope-labeled CD44ct.\nUpon successful cloning, transformation and expression of the gene construct, we purified unlabeled as well as isotope-enriched CD44ct (690-742). 9 Overall, we obtained similar yields and purities for our construct to those previously reported. 9 The 1 H-15 N-HSQC NMR spectra of isotope-labelled CD44ct(690-742) were compared with spectra of CD44ct(669-742) 9 and showed nearly identical 1 H-15 N correlation NMR fingerprints (Fig. 2a), except for the N-terminal residues not present in truncated CD44ct (missing aa 669-689) and the presence of an affinity tag (His 6 tag) at the C-terminus. 9 Synthesis of palmCD44ct(669-689), carrying a single palmitoylation at residue 676, was achieved by Fmoc-based SPPS chemistry on a Oamino(methyl)aniline (MeDbz) NovaSyn\u00aeTGR resin. 50 The MeDbz resin allows the controlled preparation of C-terminal thioester peptides similarly to alternative chemistries such as the use of C-terminal hydrazides. [51][52][53] The C-terminal MeDbz moiety can be transformed into an activated N-acyl-N'-methyl-benzimidazolinone (MeNbz) moiety after peptide assembly and subsequently enables conversion into a C-terminal thioester for NCL. 54 After assembly of palmitoylated CD44ct(669-689) on the solid phase, the C-terminal MeDbz moiety was activated with p-nitrophenyl chloroformate, yielding resin-bound palmCD44ct(669-689)-MeNBz. 50 Final cleavage and preparative HPLC purification resulted in 19 mg of palmCD44ct(669-689)-MeNBz peptide with a purity of more than 95 % for subsequent ligation reactions (Fig. 2b and3d).\nThe synthetic peptide palmCD44ct(669-689)-MeNbz was converted into the corresponding thioester followed by ligation with isotopelabeled CD44ct(690-742) at a concentration of 2 mM and cysteine desulfurization, all carried out in a one-pot reaction. MesNa (sodium 2mercaptoethanesulfonate) was used as thiol additive for the N-acylurea to thioester conversion and ligation reaction as it is compatible with desulfurization conditions (Fig. 3a). 50,55,56 The ligation was monitored via analytical RP-HPLC and LC-MS (Fig. 3b). After 9 h, desulfurization was initiated by adding water-soluble VA-044 as radical initiator in presence of neutralized TCEP, DTT and MesNa as the H-donor. Desulfurization ran for 6 h and converted Cys690 (required for NCL) into native Ala690, yielding the desired desulfurized product palmCD44ct (669-742) (Fig. 3). 36 We obtained 3.2 mg of desulfurized, segmentally isotope-labeled palmCD44ct(669-742) (~40 % overall yield over two steps) with a purity of >95 % (Fig. 3c,d). We then further characterized the non-desulfurized reaction intermediate and our semisynthetic palmCD44ct(669-742) product by gel electrophoresis without reducing agents. As expected, we observed disulfide formation for the Cyscontaining reaction intermediate giving rise to CD44ct dimers, whereas the desulfurized product did not form dimers (Fig. 3c).\nHaving semisynthetic, segmentally isotope labeled palmCD44ct in hand, we dissolved the lyophilized protein in NMR buffer and 1 H- 15 N correlation NMR spectra of palmCD44ct were acquired (Fig. 4). 9 We observed lower solubility of our palmitoylated variant compared to recombinantly expressed CD44ct(669-742) due to palmitoylation. The overall decrease in signal intensities of the segmentally labelled variant was a very likely a result of micelle formation in solution due to the amphiphilic character of palmCD44ct. The 1 H- 15 N HSQC NMR spectra were acquired for semisynthetic palmCD44ct (Fig. 4c) and chemical shifts were compared with unmodified CD44ct(669-742) (Fig. 4b). The backbone amide resonances of residues 669 to 689 in our semisynthetic variant cannot be observed in the 1 H-15 N-HSQC spectrum, as the synthetic segment is not 15 N-and 13 C-enriched. Overlay of the respective 1 H- 15 N-HSQC spectra of unmodified 9 with palmCD44ct shows similar NMR fingerprints for backbone amide resonance signals for residues 690 to 738 (Fig. 4c). This suggests that the protein remains intrinsically disordered in the lipidated form. However, the palmitoylation induced small but significant chemical shift perturbations in the HSQC spectra, corrected for the presence of the His 6 tag, (Fig. 4b). These chemical shift perturbations were compared with intramolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) measurements, which provided evidence for the existence of transient tertiary contacts in the unmodified CD44ct (Fig. 5). The chemical shift perturbations were larger in the region (residues 710-716) where intramolecular contacts were observed on the PRE measurements, suggesting a possible impact of palmitoylation on the (transient) formation of compact states before membrane attachment. Palmitoylation might therefore modulate the conformational ensemble of CD44ct by stabilizing long-range contacts that are only partly formed in the unmodified state, and which might influence membrane insertion.\nPTMs, such as the addition of palmitoylation to a side chain, can cause long-range perturbations in the chemical environment of backbone residues. 57 Remarkably, those effects can be located at a large distance from the actual PTM and are a common feature in IDPs. 49,58,59,60 Our results suggest a slightly altered conformation of CD44 upon palmitoylation, which might lead to differences in conformation and dynamics in its free as well as in its membrane-bound form. Therefore, palmitoylation of Cys676 has the potential to disrupt formation of carcinogenic CD44 homodimers, and might also lead to altered intramolecular and membrane interaction patterns. 16  \n**Summary & conclusion**\nIn this work we utilize protein semisynthesis to generate the cytoplasmatic domain of CD44 bearing a site-specific PTM and to segmentally isotope label our protein of interest. Furthermore, we provide insights into the effects of palmitoylation on palmCD44ct(669-742) conformation by NMR spectroscopy. Palmitoylation of Cys676 has been shown to be necessary for subsequent lipid raft association. 20 Therefore, its role might be crucial in controlling CD44\u2032s dual role as a tumor suppressor as well as an oncoprotein. Previous experiments have clearly shown that lipidation of Cys676 abolishes the ability of CD44 to dimerize. 15,16 In addition, fluorescence based characterization of CD44 on living cells enabled a coarse structural analysis of such CD44 clusters, 61 but molecular details of these (sub-)raft structures remains elusive so far. Our synthetic route provides a new starting point for studies on the importance of CD44 lipidation events, the effects on protein structure and its clustering patterns on membranes, and has the potential to increase our knowledge about the role of CD44 in certain cancers.\n**Materials & methods**\n**Reagents & chemicals**\nFmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) and orthogonally protected amino acids were obtained from Iris Biotech GmbH, Marktredwitz, Germany.\n1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and 2-(1H-Benzotriazole-1yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) were purchased from GL Biochem, Shanghai, China.

N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (DCM), acetonitrile (ACN) were purchased from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). VA-44 was obtained from TCl Chemicals (Germany). All other chemical reagents and solvents were purchased in the highest available purity from the following sources: Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany), Fisher-Scientific (Schwerte, Germany), TCI-Europe (Zwijndrecht, Belgium), VWR (Darmstadt, Germany), Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Invitrogen (Darmstadt, Germany), J.T.Baker (Griesheim, Germany), NeoLab (Heidelberg, Germany) or Omnilab (Bremen, Germany). Recombinant Expression of CD44ct(690-742) was performed as described previously. 9 The E. coli expression strain BL21 (DE3) carried a pETM-11 expression vector coding for a CD44ct(690-742)-His 6 fusion protein. 9,62 Expression was carried out using LB media (unlabeled expression) or minimal medium supplemented with suitable precursor molecules (for 13 C/ 15 N isotopic labeling). 63 Bacterial overnight cultures were grown in LB medium until they reached an OD600 of 0.8. For isotopic labeling, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 4 \u2022 C for 15 min and resuspended in minimal medium. To induce expression, IPTG was added at a final concentration of 1 mM after an equilibration period of 10 min at 37 \u2022 C. Following induction, the culture was incubated at 28 \u2022 C with appropriate agitation for 18 h. Afterwards, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 4 \u2022 C for 20 min. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 40 mL washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8) per liter expression culture supplemented with Halt\u2122 Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific\u2122) and 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Cell lysis was achieved through sonication, followed by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm and 4 \u2022 C for 40 min. The supernatant containing CD44ct(690-742)-His 6 was transferred to a round flask and stirred at 80 \u2022 C for 10 min until white precipitation was visible. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm and 4 \u2022 C for 40 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap\u2122 High-Performance (GE Healthcare) affinity chromatography column preloaded with Ni 2+ ions. After equilibration (with 50 mM Tris-HCl) the column was washed with at least 3 column volumes of a low imidazole buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1000 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8) and reequilibrated with washing buffer. Elution was performed using an elution buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 8) with a successively increasing gradient. Afterwards all collected fractions containing CD44ct(690-742) were combined and concentrated using a 3 kDa cutoff Amicon\u00ae Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Merck). The concentrated protein was loaded onto a HiLoad\u00ae 16/600 Superdex\u00ae 75 pg column pre-equilibrated with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM NaCl, 0.02 % NaN 3 , pH 6.5) and subjected to size exclusion chromatography using the same buffer. The collected fractions containing the CD44ct(690-742) were pooled and concentrated using a 3 kDa cutoff Amicon\u00ae Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Sigma) until a concentration of approximately 0.7-0.9 mM was reached. Concentration was determined using BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Scientific\u2122) and measurements of free thiol via the 5,5\u2032-dithio-bis-[2-nitrobenzoic acid] reaction (Thermo Scientific\u2122). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -20 \u2022 C until further usage. 9 Analytical characterization via SDS-PAGE was performed under conditions described by Laemmli using 15 % separating gels. 64 Sample loading was carried out in 2x SDS-loading buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, 6 % (w/v) SDS, 35 % (vol%) glycerol and 0.05 % (w/v) bromophenol blue, pH 6.8). Please note that SDS-loading buffer was not supplemented with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. For gel staining and de-staining, a Coomassie solution (0.1 % (w/v) Coomassie R250, 10 % (vol%) acetic acid and 45 % (vol%) methanol in water) and de-staining solution (10 % (vol%) acetic acid and 40 % (vol%) methanol in water) were used. 65 SPPS & on-resin palmitoylation of palmCD44ct(669-689)-MeDbz: SPPS-derived peptide sequence of palmCD44ct(669-689)-MeDbz: AVNSRRRDapGQKKKLVINSGNG-MeDbz-resin\n**Recombinant Expression of**\n**Palmitoylation site: Cys to Dap mutation at amino acid residue 676 Synthesis modification: double coupling of amino acid residues**\nPalmCD44ct(669-689)-MeDbz was generated via Fmoc-SPPS on a commercially available MeDbz NovaSyn\u00aeTGR resin (Sigma-Aldrich). 50 After loading of the first amino acid residue synthesis was performed on a PTI Tribute Peptide Synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc., USA) at room temperature. Synthesis was performed at 0.2 mmol scale using 5 eq. amino acid, 4.5 eq. activator (HBTU) and 5 eq. base (DIPEA). If required, double couplings were performed at certain positions as shown in the sequence above. Coupling time was 60 mins. Following the last amino acid residue, the resin was washed several times with DMF and DCM. While swelling the resin for 30 min in DCM, 500 mL of MTT cleavage solution (DCM/TFA/TIS, 98:1:1) were prepared. Deprotection of MTT was performed using 20 mL of cleavage solution for 2 min under constant agitation and a subsequent washing step with at least 3 syringe volumes of DCM. The latter steps were repeated in a continuous cycle (~20 times) until no color change of the solvent could be observed. As a final step, the resin was washed several times with DMF and then rinsed with 1 % (v/v) DIPEA in DCM to reach a basic pH environment for onresin palmitoylation. The resin was washed several times with DCM and finally kept in DCM for 30 min. In the meantime, 24 mL palmitoyl chain coupling solution was prepared as followed (for 0.2 mmol scale): 20 eq. palmitoyl chloride (4 mmol), 20 eq. HOBt (4 mmol), 22 eq. Triethylamine (4.4 mmol) in DCM/DMF (3:1). Palmitoylation reaction was performed overnight. The next day the resin was washed thoroughly with DMF and DCM. Subsequent activation of the MeDbz functionality was achieved using a solution of p-nitrophenyl chloroformate (100 mg, 0.5 mmol) in DCM. After 1 h the solution was drained, the resin was washed with DCM and treated with a solution of DIEA (0.5 M in DMF) for 15 min. Afterwards the resin was washed with DMF, DCM and finally dried overnight and cleaved using a standard cleavage cocktail (TFA/ TIS/H 2 O, 95:2.5:2.5) for 2 h. Then, the TFA solution containing the peptide was precipitated in Et 2 O (2x), centrifuged, dissolved in H 2 O/ ACN (50:50) and lyophilized. 50 Preparative RP-HPLC was performed on a Waters Purification HPLC system (Waters 2545 Quarternary Gradient Module, Waters 2489 UV/Visible Detector & Waters Fraction Collector III) using a Kromasil C18 column (300-10-C18, 250 x 21.2 mm, 10 \u03bcm particle size) at a flow rate of 10 mL/min, running a linear gradient of 15 % to 65 % solvent B (ACN + 0.08 % TFA) in solvent A (ddH2O + 0.1 % TFA) over 50 min, monitoring absorption at 214 and 280 nm. Fractions containing pure palmCD44ct(669-689)-MeDbz peptide were combined, frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized and stored at -20 \u2022 C until further usage.\nAnalytical characterization of the crude (dissolved in 6 M Gdn-HCl pH 4.7) as well as purified peptides were performed as follows: RP-HPLC was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 instrument using a Kromasil C18 column (300-5-C18, 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min running a linear gradient of 5 % to 65 % of solvent B (ACN + 0.08 % TFA) in solvent A (ddH2O + 0.1 % TFA) over 30 min at 30 \u2022 C, monitoring absorption at 214 and 280 nm. Analytical LC-MS as well as ESI-MS characterizations were performed on a Waters Auto Purification HPLC-MS system (equipped with 3100 Mass Detector, 2545 Binary Gradient Module, 2767 Sample Manager and 2489 UV/Visible Detector). Mass spectra were acquired by electrospray ionization (ESI) operating in positive ion mode. Separations were achieved with a Kromasil C18 column (300-5-C18, 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min while running a linear gradient of 5 % to 65 % of solvent B (ACN + 0.05 % TFA) in solvent A (ddH2O + 0.05 % TFA) in 10 min, monitoring absorption at 214 nm. Analytical characterization via SDS-PAGE was performed as described above.\n**MesNa thioester conversion, native chemical ligation & one-pot desulfurization**\nBuffers used for thioester conversion, ligation reactions and one-pot desulfurization reactions were degassed via argon or nitrogen purging for at least 5 min before usage. For the MesNa thioester conversion of palmCD44ct(669-689)-MeDbz, the peptide was dissolved in 6 M Gdn-HCl in 200 mM Sodium Phosphate buffer supplemented with 200 mM MesNa and 75 mM TCEP. Afterwards, the pH was adjusted to 7.5 and the solution was kept at room temperature for 10 min. In order to initiate the ligation reaction, 13 C/ 15 N-labelled recombinant CD44ct (690-742) was directly added from the NMR stock solutions to the previously prepared ligation solution, vortexed briefly and the pH was adjusted to pH 7.5. The ligation reaction was performed at 30 \u2022 C for 9 h under constant agitation. The ligation reaction progress was monitored by LC-MS and analytical RP-HPLC. Therefore, 10 \u00b5L of ligation reaction sample was mixed with 11 \u00b5L of 5 % solvent B (ACN + 0.08 % TFA) in solvent A (ddH2O + 0.1 % TFA) and injected on both systems. Analytical RP-HPLC monitoring was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 instrument using a Kromasil C18 column (see above) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min running a linear gradient of 5 % to 65 % of solvent B (ACN + 0.08 % TFA) in solvent A (ddH2O + 0.1 % TFA) over 30 min at 30 \u2022 C, monitoring absorption at 214 and 280 nm. Analytical LC-MS was performed on a Waters Auto Purification HPLC-MS system (see above). Separations were achieved with a Kromasil C18 column at a flow rate of 1 mL/min while running a linear gradient of 5 % to 65 % of solvent B (ACN + 0.05 % TFA) in solvent A (ddH2O + 0.05 % TFA) in 10 min.\nDesulfurization of the segmentally labelled ligation product was performed in a one-pot manner directly after the ligation was finished. 35,36 Therefore, the ligation solution was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with freshly prepared desulfurization buffer. The latter consisted of 6 M Gdn-HCl in 200 mM Sodium Phosphate buffer supplemented with 350 mM TCEP, 50 mM VA-44 and 50 mM DTT at pH 6.0. The reaction was carried out at 40 \u2022 C under exclusion of light in a water bath. After 3 h the desulfurization solution was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with freshly prepared desulfurization buffer and pH was readjusted to 6.0 again before incubating the reaction for additional 3 h. The reaction was finished after 6 h. Progress of the desulfurization reaction was monitored by RP-HPLC and LC-MS with identical settings as for ligation monitoring. Prior to HPLC purification of palmCD44ct(669-742) the sample was quenched via 1:1 dilution with quenching buffer (900 \u00b5L 6 M Gdn-HCL, 100 \u00b5L \u03b2-mercaptoenthanol & a few crystals of TCEP) and incubated for at least 15 min. Analytical RP-HPLC purification was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 instrument using a Kromasil C18 column (see above) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min running a linear gradient of 30 % to 40 % of solvent B (ACN + 0.08 % TFA) in solvent A (ddH2O + 0.1 % TFA) over 20 min at 60 \u2022 C, monitoring absorption at 214 and 280 nm. Fractions containing the desired product were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized. Analytical characterization of the final ligation product was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 instrument using a Kromasil C4 column (300-5-C4, 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min running a linear gradient of 5 % to 65 % of solvent B (ACN + 0.08 % TFA) in solvent A (ddH2O + 0.1 % TFA) over 30 min at 30 \u2022 C, monitoring absorption at 214 and 280 nm. Analytical ESI-MS characterization was performed on a Waters Auto Purification HPLC-MS system (see above) in positive ion mode. Analytical characterization via SDS-PAGE was performed as described above.\n**NMR experiments**\nAll NMR experiments were recorded at 20 \u2022 C (293 K) on either a Bruker 800 MHz (Avance NEO) spectrometer equipped with TXI probehead. 100 \u03bcM 15 N, 13 C double labeled CD44ct(669-742), CD44ct (691-742) or palmCD44ct(669-742)) sample in NMR buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl (pH 6.5), 0.05 % (w/v) NaN 3 ) was used. The assignment experiments of the CD44ct(669-742) are described in a previous publication 9 and the chemical shifts deposited in BMRB (ID: 27625). Data processing was carried out with qMDD for non-uniform sampled data (assignment experiments) and NMRPipe (two-dimensional 1 H-15 N correlation experiments) for all uniformly collected experiments. Data analysis was performed with CcpNmr Analysis.\n**MTSL labeling**\nPurified proteins (CD44ct) containing one Cys reacted with S-(1oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3-yl) methyl methanesulfonothioate (MTSL), containing a free electron. The protein solution was incubated for 15 min with 10 mM DTT to reduce all the cysteines. Then, the buffer was exchanged using a PD-10 column to the MTSL-tagging buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mM EDTA, pH = 8). The free-thiol concentration was measured with 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB or Ellman's reagent). The absorbance at 412 nm (Abs 412 ) was monitored to check the efficacy of the reaction. A 2.5-fold excess of MTSL was added and the incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 2-3 h until the Abs 412 is null. Then, the sample was concentrated, and buffer exchanged to the NMR buffer (without DTT or any other reducing agent). For the paramagnetic form, a 3-fold excess of ascorbic acid was added.\n**Intramolecular paramagnetic relaxation relaxation (PRE) enhancements**\nEquimolar amounts of CD44ct labelled with MTSL were mixed with\n\n\nCD44, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane receptor, plays a crucial role in cell growth, migration, and tumor progression. Dimerization of CD44 is a key event in signal transduction and has emerged as a potential target for anti-tumor therapies. Palmitoylation, a posttranslational modification, disrupts CD44 dimerization and promotes CD44 accumulation in ordered membrane domains. However, the effects of palmitoylation on the structure and dynamics of CD44 at atomic resolution remain poorly understood. Here, we present a semisynthetic approach combining solid-phase peptide synthesis, recombinant expression, and native chemical ligation to investigate the impact of palmitoylation on the cytoplasmic domain (residues 669-742) of CD44 (CD44ct) by NMR spectroscopy. A segmentally isotope-labeled and site-specifically palmitoylated CD44 variant enabled NMR studies, which revealed chemical shift perturbations and indicated local and long-range conformational changes induced by palmitoylation. The long-range effects suggest altered intramolecular interactions and potential modulation of membrane association patterns. Semisynthetic, palmitoylated CD44ct serves as the basis for studying CD44 clustering, conformational changes, and localization within lipid rafts, and could be used to investigate its role as a tumor suppressor and to explore its therapeutic potential.\n\n",
