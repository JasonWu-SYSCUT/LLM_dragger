    "abstract": "Abnormal inflammation of vascular endothelial cells occurs frequently in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B) is a lipid raft enzyme and plays an anti-inflammatory role in various diseases but its function in DR-related vascular endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. We first found that SMPDL3B expression was upregulated from week 10 to 18 in the retinal tissues of db/db mice. Particularly, the high expression of SMPDL3B was mainly observed in retinal vascular endothelium of DR mice. To interfere retinal SMPDL3B expression, adeno-associated viruses 2 (AAV-2) containing SMPDL3B specific shRNA (1233-1253 bp) were injected into the vitreous cavity of db/db mice. SMPDL3B silencing exacerbated the spontaneous DR by further activating the NF-kappaB/NLRP3 pro-inflammatory pathway. In vitro, human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRVECs) were infected with SMPDL3B-shRNA lentiviruses and then stimulated with 30 mM glucose (HG) for 24 h. SMPDL3B-silenced HRVECs secreted more interleukin-1beta and had enhanced nuclear p65 translocation. Notably, HG treatment induced the palmitoylation of SMPDL3B. Zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5) is a palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the palmitoylation of its substrates, HG exposure increased the interaction between ZDHHC5 and SMPDL3B in HRVECs. 2-BP, a palmitoylation inhibitor, accelerated the protein degradation of SMPDL3B, whereas palmostatin B, a depalmitoylation inhibitor, decreased its turnover rate in HRVECs. Collectively, the present study suggests a compensatory increase of SMPDL3B in HG-treated HRVECs and the retinal tissues of DR mice, indicating that SMPDL3B may be a potential target for DR treatment.\n",

    "fullText": "**Introduction**\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular disease of all diabetes-related microvascular complications, which result in severe visual impairment and blindness [1]. DR is mainly divided into non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). NPDR is the early stage of DR, where insufficient perfusion leads to chronic vascular inflammation of retinal capillaries (mainly manifested as leukocyte infiltration) and irreversible hypoxia [2]. The presence of this capillary inflammation can also cause a breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and vascular leakage [3,4]. NPDR further develops into PDR, which is associated with an increased risk of vision loss due to neovascularization and eventually traction retinal detachment [5]. Retinal endothelial cell injury is a key participant in the early development of NPDR. Retinal endothelial cells, which line the dendritic microvascular system that supplies and drains the neuroretina, are crucial for the nutritional supply and visual maintenance of the retina [6]. Endothelial cells not only supply oxygen and other nutrients to the metabolically active retina but also help protect the BRB by eliminating circulating molecular toxins and pro-inflammatory leukocytes [6]. Endothelial cell damage is the main reason of retinal vascular leakage and neovascularization, as well as the transportation of microorganisms and inflammatory cells. Therefore, the alteration of retinal endothelium plays a very important role in the occurrence of retinal diseases and is one of the markers of DR. Exploring the mechanism of retinal endothelial injury induced by diabetes is of great significance for DR treatment.\nSphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B) is a lipid raft enzyme that regulates plasma membrane fluidity. Studies have shown that after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, mice with SMPDL3B deficiency exhibit more interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) release than the wild type mice [7]. Taesik et al. have also reported that overexpression of SMPDL3B reduces the expression and secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2) and TNF-\u03b1 in thrombospondin 1-treated macrophages [8]. These findings suggest the anti-inflammatory potential of SMPDL3B. By analyzing the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE28831) analysis results, we found a significantly increase in SMPDL3B expression in the retinal tissues of DR rats, which indicates that SMPDL3B may be involved in the process of DR but currently the function of SMPDL3B in DR is unknown. Additionally, macrophages with SMPDL3B deletion showed sustained degradation of IkappaBalpha (I\u03baB\u03b1), indicating a negative regulation between SMPDL3B and the NF-\u03baB signaling [7]. The NF-\u03baB signaling is over-activated in retinal endothelial cell injury induced by high glucose and in retinal tissues of the DR model, and inhibition of this pathway alleviates the endothelial injury of DR [9,10]. We thus speculated that SMPDL3B might participate in the process of DR by regulating the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.\nPalmitoylation (or S-palmitoylation) refers to the reversible chemical connection between palmitate molecules and cysteine residues. This reversible post-translational modification can alter the localization, stability, and function of proteins [11]. It has been reported that protein palmitoylation changes exist in vascular complications of diabetes, and high glucose stimulation cause increased palmitoylation of R-Ras protein [12]. Zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5) is one of the palmitoyltransferases that mediate the binding of palmitate to cysteine residues on substrates. For example, ZDHHC5 has been indicated to mediate nucleoside binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2) palmitoylation modification and increase the protein stability of NOD2 [13]. Herein, we found that ZDHHC5 bound to SMPDL3B at the protein level, which was analyzed by the HitPredict website (http:// www.hitpredict.org/). We thus hypothesized that the dysregulation of SMPDL3B expression in DR process might involve palmitoylation modification. Overall, this study mainly focused on the role and mechanism of SMPDL3B in DR-induced endothelial injury in order to provide a new direction for the treatment of DR.\n\n**Materials and methods**\n**Experimental animals and groups**\nAll animal procedures were complied with the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Ethical Committee of China Medical University. Animals were grouped and treated as follows:\nGroup 1: Eight-week-old male db/db mice and db/m mice were purchased from Beijing Huafukang Bioscience Co., Inc. (China). The db/ db mice with C57BLKS/J background, weighted 38-44 g, were genetically diabetic leptin receptor-mutated mice characterized by spontaneous obesity and hyperglycemia and were used as the DR model. The wide-type C57BLKS/J mice (db/m mice, 20-22 g) were used as the control. All mice were maintained at 22 \u00b1 1 \u2022 C with a 12 h light/dark cycle and 45-55% humidity. These mice were raised until 8, 14, and 18 weeks old, respectively, and eyeball tissues were taken and stored for subsequent testing. Blood glucose levels were measured and mice were considered diabetic when the blood glucose levels were 13.9 mmoL/L or higher for two consecutive days. The timeline of the experimental protocol was shown in Fig. S1A.\nGroup 2: Control (db/m mice), DR (db/db mice), DR + AAV2-mNC sh , and DR + AAV2-mSMPDL3B sh groups were divided. Due to diabetes onset around 10 weeks of age [14], thus mice aged 10 weeks were used for gene intervention. For DR + AAV2-mNC sh and DR + AAV2-mSMPDL3B sh groups, db/db mice were injected with either AAV2 solution (1 \u03bcL each eye, 2 \u00d7 10 9 vg) or PBS into the vitreous cavity of both eyes. Eight weeks later, eyeball tissues were taken and stored for subsequent testing. The timeline of the experimental protocol was shown in Fig. S1B.\n**Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV2) construction and injection**\nThe vehicle virus and SMPDL3B silencing virus were packaged and generated by Anhui General Biological Systems Co., Ltd. (China). Briefly, for RNA interference, oligonucleotides targeting mouse smpdl3b or the sequence without any predicted target gene were cloned into the pAAV2-CMV-U6 Track vector (Wanlei Biological Technology Co., Ltd., China) to obtain pAAV2-CMV-U6-mNC sh and pAAV-CMV-U6-mSMPDL3B sh plasmids. These constructed vectors were then cotransfected with pRC2-mi342 and pHelper plasmids (Cat No.6230, Takara, China) into AAV-293 cells (Cat No. iCell-h404, iCell, China) to generate AAV2-mSMPDL3B sh and AAV2-mNC sh plasmids. The titer of the rAAV2 was 1 \u00d7 10 12 vector genomes per milliliter.\n**Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis**\nTotal RNA was extracted from retinal tissues and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRVECs) using TRIpure lysate (Cat No. RP1001, BioTeke, China). The purity and concentration of the RNA were assessed by a NANO 2000 ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Then, the total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using BeyoRT II M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Cat No.D7160L, Beyotime, China) according to the supplier's protocol. RT-qPCR was performed by using specific primers (Table S1, GENERAL BIOL, China) with GAPDH as an internal control. The qPCR reaction system was 20 \u03bcL and was performed using SYBR Green (0.5 \u03bcL, Cat No.SY1020, Solarbio, China), PCR MasterMix (10 \u03bcL, Cat No.PC1150, Solarbio), specific primers for the target genes (total 1 \u03bcL), cDNA template (1 \u03bcL), and ddH 2 O (7.5 \u03bcL). The qPCR cycling conditions were as follows: predenaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 5 min and 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 10 s, annealing at 60 \u2022 C for 10 s, and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 15 s. The 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method was used for gene expression quantification and GAPDH served as an internal control.\n**Western blot analysis**\nProteins from retinal tissues and HRVECs were obtained by using RIPA buffer (Cat No.R0010, Solarbio) mixed with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; Cat No.P0100, Solarbio). The protein concentrations were determined by using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Cat No.PC0020, Solarbio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty micrograms of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%, 10%, and 15%) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Cat No.IPVH00010, Millipore, USA). The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h and then incubated with primary antibody (Table S2) overnight at 4 \u2022 C. After incubation, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies (Table S2) for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. The protein bands were visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Cat No.PE0010, Solarbio), and the membrane was then exposed to film. GAPDH served as the internal control and the expression levels of protein were normalized to GAPDH.\n**Histopathological analysis**\nThe retina tissues were quickly isolated, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Cat No.80096618, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, China), embedded with paraffin, and cut into 5 \u03bcm sections. Retinal paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin (Cat No. H8070, Solarbio) and eosin (Cat No.A600190, Sangon Biotech, China). Then, the sections were dehydrated, cleared with graded ethanol, and sealed with neutral adhesive. The images were observed under a microscope (200\u00d7, Cat No.BX53, Olympus, Japan).\n**Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining**\nAfter the sections were dewaxed in xylene and hydrated in gradient ethanol, antigen repair was performed by placing the sections into the heated antigen repair solution for 10 min. Samples were then treated with 3% H 2 O 2 for 15 min at room temperature to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. After being blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Cat No.A602440-0050, Sangon Biotech) for 15 min at room temperature, samples were incubated with rabbit-sourced SMPDL3B antibody (1:100 dilution, Cat No.Bs-12642R, Bioss, China) overnight at 4 \u2022 C followed by the incubation of horseradish peroxidase-labeled antirabbit IgG (1:500 dilution, Cat No.#31,460, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 60 min at 37 \u2022 C. Next, sections were stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Cat No.DAB-1031, Maixin-Bio, China) and counterstained with hematoxylin (Solarbio) and the images were captured under a microscope (200\u00d7, Olympus).\n**Immunofluorescence (IF) staining**\nThe sections were first dehydrated and cleared with graded ethanol. To block nonspecific binding, sections were treated with 1% BSA (Sangon Biotech) for 15 min at room temperature. Then, the sections were co-incubated with mouse-sourced CD31 (1:50 dilution, Cat No.sc-376,764, Santa Cruz, USA) and rabbit-sourced SMPDL3B antibodies HRVECs cultured on the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent) for 15 min and then permeated with 0.1% tritonX-100 (Cat No.ST795, Beyotime) for 30 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1% BSA (Sangon Biotech) for 15 min, cells were incubated with rabbit-sourced SMPDL3B antibody (1:100 dilution; Bioss) or rabbit-sourced p65 antibody (1:100 dilution Cat No.AF5006, Affinity) overnight at 4 \u2022 C. The next day, cells were treated with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution, Invitrogen) for 60 min at room temperature. After being counterstained with DAPI, images were obtained under a fluorescence microscope (400\u00d7, Olympus).\n**Enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assays**\nThe IL-1\u03b2 levels in mouse retinal tissues and HRVECs cell supernatant were determined by using a mouse IL-1\u03b2 ELISA detection kit (Cat No.EK201B, Multi-Science, China) and human IL-1\u03b2 ELISA test kit (Cat No.EK101B, Multi-Science) according to the manufacturer's instruction.\n**Cell culture, infection, and treatment**\nConsidering the disease induction and research direction, HRVECs were treated with high glucose (HG) to establish cell model, which is consistent with previous studies [15][16][17]. HRVECs were purchased from Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co.,Ltd. (Cat No.ZQY015, China) and cultured in ECM medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cat No.11011-8611, Tian Hang Biotech, China) and 5.5 mM glucose.\nTo achieve SMPDL3B silencing, the specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically targeting SMPDL3B or negative control (NC) was inserted into the pLVX-shRNA1 lentivirus (LV; Cat No.BR004, Fenghui Biotech, China) vector to generate LV-hNC sh and LV-hSMPDL3B sh recombinant plasmids. The viral titer for lentivirus vectors was 1 \u00d7 10 TU/mL. Cells in the HG group were cultured in medium containing 30 mM glucose for 24 h, and cells in the NG group were cultured in medium with 5.5 mM glucose for 24 h. For HG + LV-hNC sh and HG + LV-hSMPDL3B sh groups, 72 h after LV infection, cells were treated with HG or NG for 24 h. JSH-23 (Cat No.J863496, Macklin, China) was used to block the NF-\u03baB pathway. Seventy-two hours after LV infection, cells were treated with HG and JSH-23 (10 \u03bcmol/L) for 24 h. To explore the effect of palmitoylation on the stability of SMPDL3B protein, HRVECs were treated with or without 2-BP (50 \u03bcM; Cat No.B135567, Aladdin, China)/palmostatin B (2.5 \u03bcM; Cat No.178501, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and cycloheximide (CHX, 100 \u03bcg/mL; Cat No.GC17198, GlpBio, China) for 0, 4, 8, or 12 h.\n**Acyl-biotin exchange palmitoylation (ABE) assay**\nCells were lysed with 1 mM PMSF (Solarbio) combined with 50 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; Cat No.N808609, Macklin). The protein concentrations were determined by using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Solarbio) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After cross-linking of antibodies or IgG with Protein A/G Agarose Gel for 1 h at 4 \u2022 C, the samples were divided into two parts and respectively treated with or without hydroxylamine (HAM; Cat No.H828371, Macklin) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the beads were gently washed with lysis buffer to remove residual HAM buffer. After removing the supernatant of the samples, each sample was treated with lysate +5 \u03bcM Biotin-HPDP buffer (Cat No.B871617, Macklin) for 1 h at 4 \u2022 C. Beads were washed 4 times in PMSF (Solarbio) and then boiled in an SDS sample loading buffer for min for analysis by SDS-PAGE.\n**Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay**\nThe Flag-labeled SMPDL3B and His-labeled ZDHHC5 plasmids were used for the Co-IP experiment in 293T cells. The 293T cells were purchased from Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co.,Ltd. (Cat No. ZQ0033) and cultured in DMEM medium with 10% FBS (Tian Hang Biotech). Flag-labeled SMPDL3B and His-labeled ZDHHC5 plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells by using Lipofectamine 3000 (Cat No.L3000015, Invitrogen). After transfection, the total proteins were extracted as described in the western blot section. After cross-linking of antibodies (100 \u03bcL) or IgG (100 \u03bcL) with Protein A/G Agarose Gel for 0.5 h at room temperature, the protein lysate was co-incubated with the Protein A/G Agarose Gel-antibody complex (protein lysate: gel suspension = 5:1) for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the supernatant was removed by centrifugation (6000 \u00d7g, 30s, 4 \u2022 C). The gel was resuspended with lysis solution and ice bathed in a shaker for 5 min. After removing the supernatant by centrifugation (6000 \u00d7g, 30s, 4 \u2022 C), the gel suspension was used for SDS-PAGE.\n**Statistical analysis**\nThe data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and analyzed via the GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad, Inc., USA) software. Unpaired t-test and one-way ANOVA were employed for comparisons between two or multiple groups. It was significant at P < 0.05.\n\n**Results**\n**The expression of SMPDL3B was upregulated in the retina tissues of DR mice**\nTo detect SMPDL3B expression in the retinal tissues of DR, retinal tissues from db/db mice aged 10, 14, and 18 weeks were collected. The mRNA and protein expression of SMPDL3B in retinal tissues was increased with the age of db/db mice compared with age-matched nondiabetic control, and peaked at week 18 (Fig. 1A). We thus chose db/db mice at 18 weeks for subsequent study. Results of H&E staining showed that retinal thickness was decreased and the number of retinal ganglion cells was reduced (marked with black arrows) in the db/db mice aged 18 weeks (Fig. 1B). These pathological changes indicated that db/db mice aged 18 weeks have already developed retinopathy (DR mice). We further determined the expression and distribution of SMPDL3B in retinal tissues of DR mice by performing IHC staining, and the results showed the strong immunoreactivities of SMPDL3B in ganglion cell layer (GCL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), and inner nuclear layer (INL), while the expression of SMPDL3B in NC group showed little brown immunostaining (Fig. 1C). As presented in Fig. 1D, the yellow fluorescence in the image represents the co-localization staining. The yellow fluorescence of GCL (marked with white arrows) in DR group was enhanced compared with the control group, indicating that the colocalization of SMPDL3B and CD31 (endothelial marker) in vessel walls in GCL was increased in DR mice compared with age-matched control (Fig. 1D). The results suggest that SMPDL3B may regulate the dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells during DR progression.\n**SMPDL3B knockdown aggravated retinopathy in DR mice**\nTo further explore the function of SMPDL3B in DR, the AAV2 solution carried SMPDL3B-specific shRNA or shNC was injected into the vitreous cavity of both eyes to achieve SMPDL3B silencing in retinal tissues. Results of RT-qPCR and western blot assays indicated that SMPDL3B mRNA and protein expression in the DR retinal tissues were successfully knocked down by AAV2 infection (Fig. 2A). After SMPDL3B expression was knocked down in DR mice, retinal became thinner and fewer retinal ganglion cells were observed (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors, IL-6, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), measured by RT-qPCR, were increased markedly in retinal tissues of DR mice, and this increase was enhanced by SMPDL3B down-regulation (Fig. 2C). \n**SMPDL3B knockdown promoted the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in retinal tissues of DR mice**\nInflammation is the main factor affecting DR pathophysiology and the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is critical for the progression of pro-inflammatory events in retinopathy [3]. The effects of SMPDL3B on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was measured by western blot in which NLRP3 and cleaved caspase 1 protein levels were increased in retinal tissues of DR mice and their levels were further increased by SMPDL3B knockdown (Fig. 3A). The IL-1\u03b2 level was found to be increased in DR group, and SMPDL3B knockdown further increased IL-1\u03b2 concentration (Fig. 3B). Meanwhile, SMPDL3B knockdown also increased NLRP3 expression in retinal tissues measured by NLRP3 immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3C). The results indicate that the impact of SMPDL3B on the progression of DR involves the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in retinal tissues.\n**SMPDL3B knockdown activated the NF-\u03baB pathway in retinal tissues of DR mice**\nThe activation of the canonical pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB pathway is also critical for the progression of pro-inflammatory events in retinopathy [18]. It was shown that the I\u03baB\u03b1 (inhibitor of NF-\u03baB pathway) protein level was decreased in DR mice, whereas its phosphorylation level at the Ser32 site was increased (Fig. 4A). SMPDL3B silencing further decreased I\u03baB\u03b1 expression but increased its phosphorylation level (Fig. 4A). The phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 was significantly increased in DR mice, which was further elevated by SMPDL3B knockdown (Fig. 4A). The phosphorylation of p65 in retinal tissues was also measured by p-p65 immunofluorescence staining and the changes in phosphorylation of p65 were consistent with those in retinal tissues measured by western blot (Fig. 4B). Overall, those results suggest that the impact of SMPDL3B on the progression of DR involves the regulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway in retinal tissues. \n**HG exposure induced SMPDL3B expression and SMPDL3B knockdown enhanced HG-induced activation of the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway in HRVECs**\nThe function of SMPDL3B in DR was also explored by in vitro experiments. HG treatment significantly upregulated SMPDL3B expression in HRVECs at both RNA and protein levels (Fig. 5A-B). To further verify the function of SMPDL3B in vitro, HRVECs were infected with lentiviruscarried shRNA specifically targeting SMPDL3B to achieve SMPDL3B silencing in HRVECs. The downregulation of SMPDL3B mRNA and protein levels in HG-treated HRVECs were verified by western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively (Fig. 5C). HG stimulation induced NLRP3 expression at both RNA and protein levels, increased cleaved caspase 1 protein expression, and promoted the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 in HRVECs, whereas SMPDL3B knockdown enhanced those changes (Fig. 5D-E). Moreover, JSH-23 (a NF-\u03baB inhibitor) treatment reversed the effects of SMPDL3B silencing on the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fig. 5F-G). Furthermore, the function of SMPDL3B in regulating the NF-\u03baB pathway was explored. It was shown that the p65 protein level in the cytoplasm was reduced but in the nucleus was increased under HG condition, SMPDL3B silencing enhanced those changes (Fig. 6A). Nuclear transfer of p65 was measured by IF staining, in which SMPDL3B knockdown promoted HGinduced nuclear accumulation of p65 (Fig. 6B). The results demonstrate that SMPDL3B negatively regulate the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway. Collectively, the data suggest that SMPDL3B knockdown accelerates HGinduced inflammation via activating NLRP3 inflammasome by activating the NF-\u03baB pathway.\n**ZDHHC5-mediated palmitoylation modification upregulated SMPDL3B expression**\nThe SwissPalm website (https://swisspalm.org/) analyzed that SMPDL3B was suggested to be potentially palmitoylated in numerous palmitoyl-protein proteomics. Moreover, ZDHHC5, the palmitoyltransferase responsible for palmitoylation, was predicted to bind to SMPDL3B at the protein level by the HitPredict website (http://www. hitpredict.org/). We thus investigated whether palmitoylation is involved in the dysregulation of SMPDL3B expression in DR. Our results  showed that SMPDL3B could be palmitoylated and its palmitoylation was increased in retinal tissues and HRVECs under DR environment (Fig. 7A-B). After blocking palmitoylation by using 2-BP, a palmitoylation inhibitor [19], SMPDL3B protein exhibited a faster turnover rate in HRVECs treated with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, 100 \u03bcg/mL) (Fig. 7C). Conversely, depalmitoylation inhibitors palmostatin B (Palm B, 2.5 \u03bcM) treatment decreased the degradation of SMPDL3B protein in HRVECs treated with CHX (Fig. 7C). Protein interactions between ZDHHC5 and SMPDL3B were also verified by Co-IP assay and HG stimulation increased their binding (Fig. 7D-E). Furthermore, as presented in Fig. 7A-B andE, the total SMPDL3B protein levels in DR and HG groups exhibited no significant difference as compared with the corresponding controls, which indicated that there was no significant difference in SMPDL3B protein content pulled down by SMPDL3B antibody between groups, ensuring a single variable. Those observations indicate that SMPDL3B expression may be regulated by ZDHHC5-mediated palmitoylation.\n\n**Discussion**\nIn the in vivo experiment, we first found that the expression of SMPDL3B changed significantly in retinal endothelial cells of DR mice, suggesting that SMPDL3B may be related to retinal endothelial dysfunction in DR. During hyperglycemia, retinal microvascular endothelial cells undergo various intracellular events, including the production of pro-inflammatory factors and chemokines, leading to disruption of BRB, endothelial injury, increased vascular permeability, and pathologic angiogenesis [5]. Therefore, in this study, we mainly investigated the role and mechanism of SMPDL3B in DR-related retinal endothelial injury. Our results suggested that SMPDL3B was significantly overexpressed during DR and the palmitoylation of SMPDL3B mediated by ZDHHC5 might be one of the reasons for the up-regulation of SMPDL3B expression. Moreover, SMPDL3B, as an anti-inflammatory factor, played a protective role in retinal vascular endothelial dysfunction during DR, which was involved in the regulation of the NF-\u03baB/ NLRP3 pathway. In addition, retinal tissue involves a variety of cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, pigment epithelial cells, neurons, and glial cells [20]. Whether SMPDL3B participates in the process of DR by influencing the physiological processes of other cells is unknown, which provides direction for our next research.\nSMPDL3B expression in macrophages regulated toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling by altering cell membrane fluidity, thus regulating inflammatory responses [7,21]. Inhibition of SMPDL3B expression amplified pro-inflammatory signals in the liver and accelerated the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [8]. In addition, overexpression of SMPDL3B enhanced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) recognition and repair and inhibited podocytes apoptosis [22]. These observations demonstrate the protective role of SMPDL3B in various disease processes. Our results indicated that SMPDL3B was highly expressed in the retinal vascular endothelium of DR mice and HGtreated HRVECs cells, suggesting that SMPDL3B may be involved in DR-related retinal vascular endothelial disorders. Knockdown of SMPDL3B accelerated the inflammation of retinal vascular endothelium and aggravated the process of DR, indicating that SMPDL3B plays a protective role in DR, and this protective effect may be realized by inhibiting the inflammatory response of retinal vascular endothelium, which is consistent with the anti-inflammatory effect of SMPDL3B previously reported [7]. In this study, the increased expression of SMPDL3B may be a self-protection mechanism in response to a pathological environment.\nNLRP3 inflammasome is composed of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-associated commission domain (ASC), and caspase-1 [23]. NLRP3 interacts with ASC to activate caspase 1. Once activated, NLRP3 inflammasome induces tissue damage by upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 [24]. NLRP3 inflammasome over-activation has been reported in retinal tissues of DR patients and animal models and has been identified as a pathogenic factor in the pathogenesis of DR [25,26]. Targeted inhibitors of NLRP3 have anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and alleviate the pathology of DR [27]. Our results suggest that SMPDL3B may alleviate DR-related vascular endothelial inflammation by negatively regulating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, the NF-\u03baB pathway, a typical inflammatory regulatory pathway, has been reported to be over-activated in the DR process, and inhibition of this pathway alleviates vascular endothelial inflammation [9,10]. The NF-\u03baB pathway can mediate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [28]. The current study also indicates that SMPDL3B alleviate DR-associated vascular endothelial inflammation by negatively regulating the activation of the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway. Previous reports have shown that SMPDL3B is a negative regulator of TLR signaling transduction [7]. TLR signaling pathway is the upstream stimulation signal of NF-\u03baB pathway [29,30]. It is speculated that SMPDL3B may inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway by regulating the TLR signaling.\nSMPDL3B is an enzyme belonging to the sphingomyelinase family known to play a critical role in the breakdown of sphingomyelin [31,32]. Various sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide (Cer) and S1P, can regulate ocular inflammatory diseases [33]. The S1P-S1P receptor signaling system plays important roles in maintenance of vascular integrity since it suppresses sprouting angiogenesis and regulates vascular permeability. Dysfunction of the S1P-S1P receptor signaling system results in various vascular defects, such as exaggerated angiogenesis in developing retina and augmented inflammation due to increased permeability [34]. Previous studies reported that SMPDL3B overexpression significantly increased S1P levels in human podocytes [35]. The negative regulation of SMPDL3B on diabetes-induced endothelial injury may also be achieved by regulating various sphingolipid metabolites levels, such as S1P.\nProtein palmitoylation is a reversible modification in which a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid (palmitate) is thioesterified to an internal cysteine residue. Proteins can cycle between palmitoylation and depalmitoylation forms [36]. Dynamic palmitoylation can affect protein localization, accumulation, secretion, stability, and function by altering membrane affinity [37,38]. Protein palmitoylation is mediated by a series of multi-channel transmembrane palmitoyltransferase, which contains the zinc finger domain and the conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC, also known as ZDHHC) motif required for palmitoyltransferase activity [39]. The results of this study showed that palmitoylation of SMPDL3B increased the protein stability of SMPDL3B, possibly mediated by ZDHHC5, suggesting that palmitoylation of the protein has a mitigating effect on the progression of DR. In addition, we noted that HG treatment increased the interaction between SMPDL3B and ZDHHC5, which may be due to the effects of HG on SMPDL3B, ZDHHC5 expressions or their subcellular localization. GPS-Palm Software [23] analyzed that sites 45 and 64 were potential cysteine modification sites and their modifications were conserved between species, we thus speculate that the palmitoylation modification of cysteine at these two sites may affect the protein stability of SMPDL3B. Furthermore, ZDHHC5 is just one of factors that regulate the protein stability of SMPDL3B, we did not further explore the function of ZDHHC5 in DR in this study. Meanwhile, palmitoylation has been shown to accelerate DR by mediating glucose-induced Rac1 activation [40]. This indicates that the effect of palmitoylation modification on the progression of DR is double-sided and depends on the function of the specific modified protein. Additionally, under the DR environment, the elevated transcription level of SMPDL3B and the increased protein stability mediated by palmitoylation modification jointly lead to the elevation of SMPDL3B protein.\nThis study is the first to reveal the regulatory effect of SMPDL3B on vascular endothelial injury during the DR process. Specifically, SMPDL3B was over-expressed in the retinal vascular endothelium of DR mice and HG-treated HRVECs. SMPDL3B silencing accelerated retinal endothelial inflammation and exacerbated the progression of DR, with potential mechanisms involving regulation of NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pathway activation. In addition, we found that ZDHHC5-mediated palmitoylation of SMPDL3B may be one of the reasons for the up-regulation of SMPDL3B expression under HG condition. Overall, our results demonstrate that the compensatory upregulation of SMPDL3B may be a potential self-protection mechanism for the retina to avoid vascular endothelial dysfunction, which provides new ideas for the treatment of DR, such as the study of targeted drugs and gene targeting tools.\n\n\nAbnormal inflammation of vascular endothelial cells occurs frequently in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B) is a lipid raft enzyme and plays an anti-inflammatory role in various diseases but its function in DR-related vascular endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. We first found that SMPDL3B expression was upregulated from week 10 to 18 in the retinal tissues of db/db mice. Particularly, the high expression of SMPDL3B was mainly observed in retinal vascular endothelium of DR mice. To interfere retinal SMPDL3B expression, adeno-associated viruses 2 (AAV-2) containing SMPDL3B specific shRNA (1233-1253 bp) were injected into the vitreous cavity of db/db mice. SMPDL3B silencing exacerbated the spontaneous DR by further activating the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 pro-inflammatory pathway. In vitro, human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRVECs) were infected with SMPDL3B-shRNA lentiviruses and then stimulated with 30 mM glucose (HG) for 24 h. SMPDL3B-silenced HRVECs secreted more interleukin-1\u03b2 and had enhanced nuclear p65 translocation. Notably, HG treatment induced the palmitoylation of SMPDL3B. Zinc finger DHHCtype palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5) is a palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the palmitoylation of its substrates, HG exposure increased the interaction between ZDHHC5 and SMPDL3B in HRVECs. 2-BP, a palmitoylation inhibitor, accelerated the protein degradation of SMPDL3B, whereas palmostatin B, a depalmitoylation inhibitor, decreased its turnover rate in HRVECs. Collectively, the present study suggests a compensatory increase of SMPDL3B in HG-treated HRVECs and the retinal tissues of DR mice, indicating that SMPDL3B may be a potential target for DR treatment.\n\n",
