    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) is a critical lipid for cellular signaling. The specific phosphorylation of the inositol ring controls protein binding as well as clustering behavior. Two popular models to describe ion-mediated clustering of PIP(2) are Martini3 (M3) and CHARMM36 (C36). Molecular dynamics simulations of PIP(2)-containing bilayers in solutions of potassium chloride, sodium chloride, and calcium chloride, and at two different resolutions are performed to understand the aggregation and the model parameters that drive it. The average M3 clusters of PIP(2) in bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine and PIP(2) bilayers in the presence of K(+), Na(+), or Ca(2+) contained 2.2, 2.6, and 6.4 times more PIP(2) than C36 clusters, respectively. Indeed, the Ca(2+)-containing systems often formed a single large aggregate. Reparametrization of the M3 ion-phosphate Lennard-Jones interaction energies to reproduce experimental osmotic pressure of sodium dimethyl phosphate (DMP), K[DMP], and Ca[DMP](2) solutions, the same experimental target as C36, yielded comparably sized PIP(2) clusters for the two models. Furthermore, C36 and the modified M3 predict similar saturation of the phosphate groups with increasing Ca(2+), although the coarse-grained model does not capture the cooperativity between K(+) and Ca(2+). This characterization of the M3 behavior in the presence of monovalent and divalent ions lays a foundation to study cation/protein/PIP(2) clustering.\n"
