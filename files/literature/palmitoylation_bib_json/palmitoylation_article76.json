A critical question is: to what extent are co-receptors and Lck coupled? Our contribution concerns Zn(2+), indispensable for CD4(-) and CD8-Lck formation. We combined biochemical and cellular approaches to show that dynamic fluctuations of free Zn(2+) in physiological ranges influence Zn(CD4)(2) and Zn(CD4)(Lck) species formation and their ratio, although the same Zn(Cys)(2)(Cys)(2) cores. Moreover, we demonstrated that the affinity of Zn(2+) to CD4 and CD4-Lck species differs significantly. Increased intracellular free Zn(2+) concentration in T cells causes higher CD4 partitioning in the plasma membrane. We additionally found that CD4 palmitoylation decreases the specificity of CD4-Lck formation in the reconstituted membrane model. Our findings help elucidate co-receptor-Lck coupling stoichiometry and demonstrate that intracellular free Zn(2+) has a major role in the interplay between CD4 dimers and CD4-Lck assembly.\n",

[34][35][36][37][38] The main protein modification guiding proteins to the membrane subdomain(s) is the reversible palmitoylation that occurs at the membrane-proximal cysteinyl residues. After T cell stimulation, newly palmitoylated proteins emerge, thus lately, the palmitome started to be considered as a regulatory mechanism in T cell signaling. 39,40 CD4 and Lck were identified in distinct membrane domains and their localization was strictly related to their palmitoylation. [41][42][43] However, the local concentrations of CD4, Lck, and free Zn 2+ additionally regulate the quantity of CD4 and Lck complexes. 22 It means that not only free Zn 2+ fluctuations but a local change of CD4 and Lck concentrations affects functional zinc clasp assembly formation. This is associated with palmitoylation, but also with the expression efficiency of co-receptors and Lck that differ, and their changes may affect the zinc clasp assembly. [44][45][46][47][48] Although the roles of both CD4/CD8 and Lck in thymic development and T cell activation have been thoroughly investigated, the role of CD4/CD8-Lck complexes and mechanisms of their action within the immune responses are still debated. 6,49 The latest reports suggest that in addition to initiating or augmenting the TCR response, they can also affect antigen affinity, which makes their mode of action more puzzling. 50 Considering the importance of the CD4 and Lck interaction in the immune response, here we complement it with a Zn 2+ -dependent mode of their action. Three different approaches were undertaken: (i) in-solution studies using model peptides, (ii) membrane reconstitution of zinc clasp assembly, and (iii) T cell studies with overexpression of CD4 and Lck where intracellular free Zn 2+ availability was controlled. Experiments using artificial membranes and a model cell line showed that cellular Zn 2+ fluctuations can induce zinc clasp assembly, thus making intracellular free Zn 2+ concentrations a limiting factor. Moreover, our study demonstrated that the palmitoylation of CD4 affects Zn(CD4)(Lck) complex formation and confirmed the physiological relevance of Zn 2+ in the plasma membrane status of CD4. Our data open new directions to the understanding of mechanistic details of TCR activation.\n\n**RESULTS**\n**Reconstitution of Zn 2+ -dependent interaction of CD4 and Lck**\nPrevious reports showed that the in-solution formation of the zinc clasp assembly occurs at a subnanomolar range of buffered free Zn 2+ concentration indicating high stability of the heterodimer (Zn(CD4)(Lck)). A similar approach showed that homodimerization of the CD4 cytoplasmic tail occurs at a higher free Zn 2+ concentration, showing that such a complex is significantly less stable. 22,51 To examine how [Zn 2+ ] free -controlled conditions contribute to zinc clasp assembly in the presence of a membrane, the interaction was reconstituted using artificial lipid bilayers. Inorganic zinc competitors provided buffering at its free concentration from 10 \u00c014 to 10 \u00c09 M (Figure 2A, supplemental information). The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD4 (CD4ct) and the N-terminal unique domain of Lck (Lck-UD) were myristylated to provide their docking (Figures 2A and2B). Fluorescent modifications at their C terminus were introduced to track the assembly via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) phenomena (Figures 2B and3A). These modifications enabled myrCD4ct(FAM) and myrLck-UD(TAMRA) to be embedded in large (LUVs) and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Instantaneous docking of protein domains in the lipid bilayer was confirmed with flotation experiments (Figure S1). Both systems differ in size, membranous properties, and handling. Application of LUVs made it possible to maintain surface density of CD4ct and Lck-UD in the membrane at 415 and 7412 molecules per mm 2 , where the former is the reference value for Lck. 52 Figure S2 presents FAM fluorescence changes in both conditions at different [Zn 2+ ] free values. No differences in fluorescence at 520 nm between myrCD4ct(FAM) alone or together with myrLck-UD(TAMRA) are detected for samples with a surface density of 415 molecules/mm 2 . However, for both CD4ct(FAM) alone or together with Lck-UD(TAMRA), a decrease in the fluorescence with increasing [Zn 2+ ] free , starting at 10 \u00c013 M, was observed. For a higher surface density (Figure S2), differences are observed between donor and donor-acceptor, and it is clearly seen that the fluorescence emission pattern in the applied free Zn 2+ concentration range is significantly different from the density of 415 molecules per mm 2 .\nDue to the drawbacks of LUV methodology, a GUV membrane model was established. The major advantage is that it better resembles the cell membrane dimensions and enables one to track single liposomes under the confocal microscope. In order to observe zinc clasp formation, single GUVs that indicated the presence of both CD4ct(FAM) and Lck-UD(TAMRA) were imaged. Figure 3B shows representative GUVs of CD4ct(FAM) and CD4ct(FAM) with Lck(TAMRA) at the free Zn 2+ concentration of 10 \u00c012 M, where FAM fluorescence lifetime is indicated. The results of zinc clasp reconstitution using GUVs at three different [Zn 2+ ] free values, 10 \u00c09 , 10 \u00c012 , and 10 \u00c014 M, show that the FAM lifetime of donor-acceptor samples differed significantly from control samples (without added Zn 2+ ) in all investigated free Zn 2+ -buffered conditions. Besides the observed drop of FAM fluorescence lifetime, also a difference in CD4ct(FAM) samples between free Zn 2+ concentration of 10 \u00c012 and 10 \u00c09 M was observed. It may indicate that the Zn(CD4ct) 2 complex is formed in addition to the zinc clasp assembly at the nanomolar free Zn 2+ concentration.\n**Palmitoylation weakens both zinc clasp assembly and CD4 dimerization**\nIt has already been shown that the specificity of zinc clasp assembly in solution is affected by the length of CD4ct, where the sequential and structural elements play a stabilizing role. 51 Although the zinc clasp heterocomplex is prevalent when CD4ct and Lck-UD are present in equimolar amounts, the availability of additional cysteinyl and histidyl CD4ct residues turned out to play a crucial role in both complex stoichiometry and CD4ct affinity for Zn 2+ . In the cell, membrane-proximal cysteine residues undergo reversible palmitoylation; thus, the influence of CD4 palmitoylation on Lck assembly was examined. At first, palmitoylated CD4ct(p) was compared with CD4ct in their Zn 2+ -and Lck-binding properties in solution (Figures 2A and2B). Relative affinities of Zn 2+ to CD4ct, CD4ct(p), and their mixtures with Lck-UD were evaluated in the competition with the chromophoric chelating probe PAR. Upon the addition of a portion of the competitive peptide to the preformed Zn(PAR) 2 complex, a decrease in absorbance is detected due to the Zn 2+ transfer from the Zn(PAR) 2 complex to the peptide(s) of choice (Figure 4A). Both CD4ct and CD4ct(p) competition curves show a substantial decrease. The transfer of Zn 2+ to CD4ct(p) occurs to a lower extent when compared with CD4ct, which indicates that palmitoylation weakens the interaction of Zn 2+ with CD4ct. (B) Reconstitution of CD4ct, CD4ct(p), and Lck-UD interactions in buffered free Zn 2+ concentration (dark blue dot) in the range of 10 \u00c014 -10 \u00c09 M maintained by zinc chelators (light blue half-moon) on the artificial membranes (yellow). Blurred yellow and pink circles represent FAM and TAMRA modifications, respectively. Model peptides were embedded in the membrane due to their myristylation (orange zigzag). (C) Scheme of T cell studies. CD4(Clover) was introduced to the Jurkat T cell line, and cells were selected to obtain the CD4 + cell line with stable overexpression of CD4(Clover). The CD4 + cell line was subjected to different intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free . The CD4 + cell line was transiently transfected with different Lck variants to observe the Zn 2+ -dependent CD4-Lck interaction studied by FRET.\nA similar pattern was demonstrated in Zn(PAR) 2 competition with CD4ct and Lck-UD equimolar mixtures where less transfer was observed to CD4ct(p) and Lck-UD (Figure 4A). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the comparison of complexes of different stoichiometry is error prone and care should be taken in drawing conclusions. To verify the mode of Zn 2+ binding to CD4ct and its palmitoylated version, circular dichroism was used to monitor structural changes. CD spectra of CD4ct, CD4ct(p), and their equimolar mixtures with Lck-UD indicated random coils with subtle changes at 202 and 220 nm upon Zn 2+ addition (Figure S3). Changes of ellipticity presented as a function of Zn 2+to-peptide molar ratio indicate a sharp inflection point at 1.0 for CD4ct, whereas CD4ct(p) shows a more flattened curve with the inflection point shifted toward 0.5. When CD4ct is in the equimolar mixture with Lck-UD, the heterodimerization is evident, but the transition from 0.5 to 1.0 Zn 2+ -to-peptide molar ratio is noticeable in the Zn 2+ titration curve. Palmitoylated CD4ct showed distinct behavior in the equimolar mixture with Lck-UD (ratio less than 0.5), suggesting that the assembly of a zinc clasp may not be completed in this condition. These results indicate that CD4ct forms complexes of distinct stoichiometry than CD4ct(p) with Zn 2+ , thus PAR competitions should be taken with care in concluding Zn 2+ -to-peptide(s) affinities in solution.\nTo evaluate differences in Zn 2+ -binding affinities, CD4ct and Lck-UD assembly was monitored in Zn 2+ -controlled media that maintain free Zn 2+ in the range of 10 \u00c014 to 10 \u00c010 M (Table S2). Fluorescently labeled (FAM)CD4ct, (FAM)CD4ct(p), and (TAMRA)Lck-UD were mixed equimolarly and FAM (donor) and TAMRA (acceptor) fluorescence intensities were registered. Figure 4B presents Zn 2+ -binding isotherms as the function of [Zn 2+ ] free . Readouts are presented as the normalized ratio of donor to acceptor fluorescence intensity. To compare binding affinities, we use logarithmic half-saturation values at which half of the complex forms, pZn 0.5 (equivalent to commonly used IC50). They were 12.7 \u00b1 0.1 and 11.9 \u00b1 0.1 for (FAM)CD4ct and (FAM) CD4ct(p) with (TAMRA)Lck-UD, respectively (Table S5). To further elucidate whether the buffered free Zn 2+ pool influences the formation of CD4ct and Lck-UD complexes in the membrane prox-imity, CD4ct(p) and Lck-UD interactions were reconstituted using the GUV lipid system. Figure 4D presents the FAM fluorescence lifetime of myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) and myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) with myrLck-UD(TAMRA) that were embedded in the GUV membrane. At [Zn 2+ ] free of 10 \u00c09 and 10 \u00c012 M, GUV liposomes with palmitoylated myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) indicated similar fluorescence lifetime as the control sample with no Zn 2+ . Contrary to myrCD4ct(FAM), no drop of FAM fluorescence lifetime was observed for myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) at the free Zn 2+ concentration of 10 \u00c09 M (Figures 3C and4D). Moreover, when myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) was placed at the membrane surface together with myrLck-UD(TAMRA), the fluorescence lifetime did not decrease, in contrast to non-palmitoylated CD4ct. At 10 \u00c09 and 10 \u00c012 M of [Zn 2+ ] free , the significant increase of the fluorescence lifetime was observed for CD4(p)(FAM) which may result from increased rigidity in the membrane proximity.\nCD4 plasma membrane status depends on intracellular free Zn 2+ concentration Since the reconstitution of CD4ct, Lck-UD, and Zn 2+ complexes on artificial membranes did show that both CD4ct and CD4ct with Lck-UD are sensitive to free Zn 2+ concentrations in the range of 10 \u00c014 -10 \u00c09 M, the CD4 plasma membrane presence was related to the intracellular free zinc in Jurkat cells as a model T cell line. Intracellular free zinc concentrations were modulated by adding or depleting extracellular zinc and determined with the fluorescent zinc probe FluoZin-3AM (Figure S4). 52 To achieve the lowest free intracellular Zn 2+ level, the novel approach of depleted media re-supplemented with a Zn 2+ metal buffer was introduced (supplemental information). Altogether, the intracellular free Zn 2+ concentrations varied from 10 \u00c011 to 10 \u00c09 M. At first, a CD4 + cell line with stable expression of CD4wt and the fluorescent reporter Clover was generated (Figure 5A, supplemental information). Double-positive CD4 + cells with different intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free were analyzed in terms of intra-and extracellular fluorescence (Figures S5 and5). Figure 5B shows a histogram analysis of mean PE fluorescence (representing CD4 surface expression) in relation to the intracellular free Zn 2+ (A) Liposomal membranes based on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). myrCD4ct(FAM) (gray) and myrLck-UD (wine) are embedded in the membrane via myristylation at their N terminus (orange zigzag). Cysteinyl residues within peptide domains are presented as circles. Zn 2+ is schematically presented in blue. Fluorescent modifications at the C terminus are glowing circles. (B) Representative GUV images of CD4ct(FAM) and CD4ct(FAM) with Lck-UD(TAMRA) at [Zn 2+ ] free of 10 \u00c012 M on the left and right, respectively, along with the FAM fluorescence average lifetime scale. Scalebars represent 10 mM. Below, there is FRET-FILM analysis of CD4ct(FAM) in gray and CD4ct(FAM) with Lck-UD(TAMRA) in blue embedded in the GUVs membrane and subjected to different [Zn 2+ ] free . Negative control of CD4ct(FAM) and Lck-UD(TAMRA) in chelexed 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KCl pH 7.4 without Zn 2+ is shown in orange. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with the Tukey test with p < 0.05 and n = 4-5 using Origin software. Error bars represent the average of 4-5 different GUV images. Significant differences refer to the ''no Zn 2+ '' control unless shown with a dashed line. concentration where a significant rise of the zinc signal was observed between 0.1 and 0.7 nM. Whereas fluorescence of PE was increasing with increasing [Zn 2+ ] free , the analysis of Clover fluorescence (representing intracellular CD4) indicated different behavior. In the same range of free Zn 2+ , Clover mean fluorescence was significantly decreasing (Figure 5C). Moreover, the gradual raise in fluorescence was observed.\nTo estimate the overall level of CD4 protein in the cell with the change of [Zn 2+ ] free , an intracellular staining protocol was introduced. Figure 5D presents the mean fluorescence of Clover and PE at different intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free values. It shows that the overall level of CD4 protein in the cell rises when intracellular free Zn 2+ increases. Altogether, the observations showed that under rising intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free there is a noticeable increase in the total amount of CD4 in the cell and that more of the CD4 becomes present at the cell surface.\n**Assembly of CD4 and Lck depends on the cellular Zn 2+ status**\nTo investigate whether assembly of CD4 and Lck is dependent on Zn 2+ -binding cysteinyl residues, the CD4 + cell line was transiently transfected with plasmids that encode Lck with the red fluorescent reporter mRuby2 at the C terminus. Transient transfection was reported as a series of confocal microscope images 24-48 h after transfection (Figure S5). In the study, wild-type protein Lck(wt), single and double alanine point mutants of Zn 2+binding cysteinyl residues Lck(1Ala) and Lck(12Ala), and the N-terminal unique domain responsible for CD4 binding via Zn 2+ Lck(UD) were used (Figures 2A and6A). Complexity of the system rendered it impossible to apply media of controlled [Zn 2+ ] free since its measurement is impossible in CD4 + cell line expressing green fluorescent protein. To monitor the CD4-Lck interaction, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) measurements with the FRET setting were taken. CD4(Clover) and Lck(mRuby2) served as the FRET pair and the mean fluorescence of cells was recorded in three channels: donor, acceptor, and FRET. Figure 6B shows the set of FACS density dot plots where the relationship of acceptor channel fluorescence (mRuby2) to donor channel fluorescence (Clover) was depicted. Quadrant gate analysis shows that CD4 + cells that were transiently transfected with the Lck(wt) plasmid are mostly found in the Q2 quadrant (CD4 + , Lck + ). In contrast, Jurkat T cells transfected with Lck (Lck + ) and non-transfected control (Jurkat) do not show fluorescence in the Q1 and Q2 quadrants of their dot plots.\nFor the FRET analysis, double-positive cells (Q2 quadrant) were taken and the ratio of mean fluorescence in the FRET channel to the mean fluorescence in the acceptor channel was determined. Mean fluorescence values were corrected for background fluorescence using Jurkat T cell samples as a control. Figure 6C presents the results of FRET analysis of CD4 + cells transiently transfected with Lck(wt), Lck(12Ala), Lck(1Ala), Lck(UD), and mRuby2 as a control. A significant decrease of FRET was observed for both Lck mutants, Lck(12Ala) and Lck(1Ala), in comparison to Lck(wt). Lck(UD) also indicated a significant decrease of FRET in comparison to Lck(wt). To further examine the increase in FRET signal observed for Lck(wt), T cell receptor signaling was activated using CD3 and CD28 (Figure S7). Upon stimulation, FRET significantly increases in CD4 + cells transiently transfected with Lck(wt) but not in the other Lck variants compared to the control cell line. However, the decrease of FRET in Lck(12Ala) and Lck(1Ala)-transfected cells is noticeable. Altogether, the analyses indicate that the zinc clasp is formed in the CD4 + Lck + Jurkat T cells and that its formation is related to the availability of Zn 2+binding cysteinyl residues.\nEquilibria simulation shows interdependence of Zn(CD4)(Lck) and Zn(CD4) 2 In order to probe whether or not [Zn 2+ ] free changes are able to alter the molar ratio between Zn(CD4)(Lck) and Zn(CD4) 2 species, equilibria simulations were performed based on the stability constants reported for peptide models (Figure S7, supplemental information). 22,51 At first, CD4 and Lck concentrations were assumed to be 200 and 50 nM, respectively. Concentration of free Zn 2+ was set as variable in the range of 10 \u00c07 -10 \u00c015 M Figure 7A presents species distribution in the function of CD4 fraction where it is seen that free Zn 2+ change between 0.1 and 10 nM leads to substantial shift toward Zn(CD4) 2 formation whereas Zn(CD4)(Lck) remains at $25% up to low nanomolar free Zn 2+ (Figures S8-S10). Next, we aimed to variate CD4 concentrations between 0.05 and 25 mM. We performed simulations at 1 and 0.1 nM free Zn 2+ (Figure 7B). It is seen that Zn(CD4) 2 starts to dominate over zinc clasp above 0.5 and 5 mM CD4 for 1 and 1 nM free Zn 2+ , respectively. There is also noticeable difference in the rate of Zn(CD4) 2 changes whereas Zn(CD4)(Lck) is mostly unaffected. At the last set of simulations, we fixed CD4 and Lck at the constant molar ratio of 4 but their concentration was variated at 1 and 0.1 nM free Zn 2+ (Figure 7C). Here, Zn(CD4)(Lck) also demonstrates constant behavior in contrary to Zn(CD4)2 that achieves $30% and $10% at 6 mM CD4 for 1 and 0.1 nM free Zn 2+ , respectively. \n\n**DISCUSSION**\nDue to Zn 2+ coordination by cysteinyl residues from both CD4ct and Lck-UD, there is a possibility to form complexes of composition distinct from Zn(CD4)(Lck). For example, it has been shown that minimal domains of both CD4ct 416-429 (14 aa) and Lck-UD 1,16-30 (16 aa) can homodimerize in the presence of Zn 2+ in solution. 53 Further studies indicated that CD4ct 396-431 binds Zn 2+ in 1:1 stoichiometry in solution whereas the C 397 A mutation leads to its Zn 2+ -dependent homodimerization. 22 Lck monomerizes with Zn 2+ very weakly, 22 thus its formation can be neglected in cellular conditions. However, in both cases, the zinc clasp heterodimer was formed predominantly.\nAlthough the zinc clasp structure was solved 15 years ago and the participation of Zn 2+ in its formation is indisputable, it is still omitted in the considerations on formation of the CD4-Lck complex. 50 However, the importance of CD4 and Lck interaction into the process of T lymphocyte development and activation on the one hand, and the impact of Zn 2+ on the immune system on the other, has been thoroughly investigated. 25,[54][55][56] The reason for such disregard may reside in the indirect proof of the complex's existence, where its disruption was observed upon treatment of cells with a membrane-permeable Zn 2+ chelator. 19 One can imagine that such treatment may cause a range of cellular Zn 2+involved effects that in turn cause complex dissociation, which does not indicate per se that Zn 2+ certainly links CD4 and Lck in a cell. Another reason possibly lies in the technical difficulties of identifying metal-involved protein-protein complexes; thus, their transient character makes capturing them difficult. 23 The zinc clasp complex differs from common structural zinc sites in proteins, where Zn 2+ is responsible either for polypeptide chain folding into special scaffolds (e.g., zinc fingers) or for stabilization of the whole protein or part of it. The Zn 2+ affinity in such sites is rather high or ultrahigh and reaches low picomolar or even femtomolar K d values, making them rather permanent under cellular conditions. 57 The interprotein metal-binding site occurring in the zinc clasp assembly is a different class of metal-binding sites where the assembly stability from an entropic point of view is less favored due to the presence of two or more protein subunits. 23 Moreover, assembly formation is strictly regulated by the actual concentrations of all its constituents. 22 From the cellular perspective, the gain of an additional factor to maintain a sufficient level of interfacial Zn 2+ complexes supports their regulatory role where assembly on demand is needed. Zinc clasp composition also raises the possibility of Zn 2+ binding by two of the same protein subunits. The selectivity of a particular Zn 2+ complex assembly is based mostly on the affinity of Zn 2+ binding to the proteins, which is supported by sequential and structural elements present within CD4 and Lck. 51,58,59 Specificity of protein-protein interactions may be further elevated when cellular membranes are involved, phenomena observed in many cellular machineries carrying out their function. 60 The involvement of distinct membrane platforms that trap or exclude proteins in induction or termination of signaling events thus has been established. [61][62][63][64] It may further support different local protein abundances that are used to reach the specific threshold of signaling molecules. 61 To check if/how the zinc clasp complex is influenced by the presence of the membrane, two frequently used lipid bilayer models have been applied to mimic the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. While the LUV model enables control of protein densities, GUVs mimic the cellular environment better regarding size, flexibility, and stiffness of the membrane. [65][66][67] The obtained results show that at the previously reported Lck surface density, there is no specificity in the formation of the zinc clasp assembly in all investigated buffered free Zn 2+ concentrations. 52 It supports the notion that CD4ct and Lck-UD domains need spatiotemporal orchestration, and the LUV model is not sufficient. Considering that the model is limited by the interferences from unbound protein domains, the GUV system was applied, where individual liposomes were chosen to examine the interaction. Changes in the fluorescence lifetime demonstrated successful zinc clasp com-plex reconstitution in all applied [Zn 2+ ] free values from 10 \u00c014 to 10 \u00c09 M. Nevertheless, both models with embedded CD4ct indicated the decrease of fluorescence (or fluorescence lifetime) with an increase of [Zn 2+ ] free . Although the peptide model of CD4ct binds Zn 2+ in 1:1 stoichiometry in solution, the intramolecular complex is formed by cysteine residues beyond these that bind Lck in heterocomplex. In the cell, these cysteine residues are placed near the membrane; thus, the formation of an intramolecular ZnCD4 complex is less likely. This notion is supported by the CD4ct mutant analysis that shows its strong homodimerization. 51 Here, the decrease in fluorescence lifetime also indicates CD4 Zn 2+ -dependent dimerization.\nApart from the factor of subunit concentration and the presence of the membrane, the research undertook to verify the influence of CD4 palmitoylation on zinc clasp assembly. So far, differential protein segregation resulting from their palmitoylation has been shown to contribute to the T cell activation processes at the cellular membrane. 39,40,68 The zinc clasp was demonstrated to partition into lipid rafts, whereas CD4 was localized mostly in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, and the process was found to be dependent on CD4 palmitoylation and CD4-Lck association. 43,69,70 Conducted experiments revealed that incorporation of a long fatty acid chain on the CD4 cytoplasmic tail changes its Zn 2+ -binding properties significantly. In solution, palmitoylated CD4ct forms one-order magnitude weaker complexes with Zn 2+ and Lck-UD. A feasible explanation is that in solution steric hindrance is substantially elevated, which prevents formation of a zinc clasp complex of higher stability. However, the interaction is completely abolished on the model membrane. Abrogated complex formation in the artificial membrane model may result from changed mobility of palmitoylated CD4. It is possible that long fatty acid chains are incorporated between membrane lipidic building blocks, making the protein domain less flexible. Such an observation also cannot exclude the The excitation of 488 and 561 nm with the emission filters of 530/30 and 610/20 nm was subjected to donor and acceptor channels, respectively. (CD4 + ) Jurkat T cells with stable CD4(Clover) expression; (CD4 + Lck + ) CD4 + Jurkat T cells transiently transfected with plasmid encoding Lck(mRuby2); (Lck + ) Jurkat T cells transiently transfected with plasmid encoding Lck(mRuby2); (Jurkat) Jurkat T cells as a control of transfection. (C) FRET studies of CD4 + Jurkat T cells expressing CD4(Clover) that was transiently transfected with Lck(mRuby2) plasmids. To obtain basal FRET, CD4 + cells were transiently transfected with mRuby2 (control). FRET was calculated as the relation of FRET to acceptor channels regarding the background fluorescence of non-transfected Jurkat T cells. Statistics were performed with one-way ANOVA with Tukey test with p < 0.5 and n = 3-4 using Origin software. Error bars represent the average of 3-4 measurements in three independent experiments. scenario in which interactions in the case of CD4 palmitoylation do not appear in the investigated free Zn 2+ concentration range. Application of artificial membrane to dissect mechanistic details of the metal-and modification-dependent interaction is mostly advantageous. Although, it is worth noting that it lacks the spatiotemporal membrane organization present in a live cell. It has been shown that Lck membrane-anchor is crucial in efficient zinc clasp formation in live-cell experiments which indicates how dynamically zinc clasp may be modulated upon cellular response such as depalmitoylation. 71 However, consideration of Zn 2+ complex formation in the context of directional enrichment within membrane subdomains is still very hard. Mechanistic details of such phenomena and the potential contribution of local Zn 2+ concentration are not yet resolved. In the face of a multitude of factors that contribute to the net outcome in the environment that would be beneficial or detrimental for complex formation, substantial efforts have been undertaken to reconstitute T cell membrane-proximal signaling events that resulted in its most critical mechanistic details. 52,67,72,73 However, Zn 2+ has never contributed to the whole picture. It seems to be high time to include it in consideration of the early events of a T cell activation pathway.\nTo further explore the influence of Zn 2+ on the CD4, its fluorescent conjugate was expressed in a Jurkat T cells. Intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free was modulated and proved to be in the 0.02-0.8 nM range, consistently with the previously reported levels. 74,75 Dual labeling of CD4 made it possible to observe the increase and the decrease of fluorescence in its extra-and intracellular parts, respectively, under increasing intracellular Zn 2+ concentrations. The increase of extracellular fluorescence may be thus explained by more CD4 being present at the cellular membrane whereas the intracellular decrease may be an indication of a Zn(CD4) 2 complex formation. However, it cannot be excluded that elevated intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free affected CD4 indirectly, causing its enrichment in the plasma membrane and the decrease of fluorescence due to e.g., molecular crowding. Certainly, Zn 2+ affects the cellular behavior of CD4, an observation that has not been reported before. To support this notion, the result of intracellular staining clearly shows that the overall pool of CD4 protein rises under Zn 2+ supplementation. Not only involvement of Zn 2+ in the process of CD4 presentation but also its presentation itself has been rarely investigated. So far, the opposite phenomenon, i.e., CD4 internalization, has been widely studied e.g., during HIV viral infection, which positioned CD4 count as a diagnostic biomarker. [76][77][78] Nevertheless, the presence of CD4 dimers has been shown, highlighting both its extracellular part and cytoplasmic cysteinyl residues responsible for the interaction. 69,79 The role of CD4 dimers has been proposed to be a prolonged contact with APC and increased TCR-APC avidity at the immunological synapse. 79 As a result, the CD4 monomer to dimer transition may play a role in the initial engagement during T cell activation, tuning the activation threshold. Recently, Horkova et al. reported CD4 surface levels being dependent on Lck. 49 They found the process to be kinase independent which allows the possibility of zinc contribution in CD4 surface regulation.\nThe interplay of Zn 2+ between CD4 and Lck is supported by the fact that the same cysteinyl residues govern CD4 dimeric assembly and the CD4-Lck formation. 69 To examine zinc clasp presence in T cells, a range of Lck plasmids were introduced to the CD4 + cell line where FRET analysis showed that CD4-Lck interaction indeed occurs in the resting state of T cells. Therefore, zinc status may affect the reactivity or activation threshold of resting T cells, which is seen in the reduced T cell activity of zinc-deficient patients. 80 Furthermore, this may explain why zinc supplementation has different effects on resting and activated T cells. 81 The involvement of Zn 2+ is manifested by a significant decrease of the level of the interaction when Zn 2+binding cysteinyl residues are mutated in Lck(wt). Interestingly, the Lck(UD) domain on its own is not able to perceive the same efficiency of the assembly as Lck(wt). It suggests that other Lck domain(s) are possibly involved and play a supporting role. (C) Species distribution of CD4 as a function of CD4 and Lck increasing concentrations. Total Lck concentration was increased from 0.5 to 1500 nM while CD4 increased from 2 to 6,000 nM in such a way that in all simulated points, the CD4/Lck molar ratio was set as 4.0. All distributions were calculated using HySS software (see supplemental information).\nStimulation of CD4 + Lck + cells by the time matching initial phase of T cell activation where zinc influx was found to operate 32 showed a similar effect of CD4-Lck increase. It is worth noting that CD4, Lck, and TCR molecules were reported to be present in separate clusters when cells were nonactivated, whereas upon activation larger structures were observed. 82 However, large interfacial surfaces may explain the pre-activation possibility of zinc clasp formation. Therefore, Zn 2+ may be essential for T cell activation, but it also explains why high Zn 2+ concentrations inhibit T cell activation. 80 Altogether, the conducted experiments indicate that interplay between Zn(CD4) 2 and Zn(CD4)(Lck) is feasible. However, the distinction between formation of two complexes when both are based on the same components should be made with care. On the one hand, methodological restrictions occur regarding the contribution of fluorescence from two differently composed complexes. On the other, accurate determination of intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free is highly needed. In vitro studies demonstrate that the formation of homo-and heterodimeric Zn 2+ complexes is well separated within the [Zn 2+ ] free range 51 ; however, the near-membrane intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free is not yet determined. In the view of FluoZin-3, which is generally known as a cytosolic zinc probe, it is worth noting that there are reports that it localizes within vesicles. 25 But it was also found that its distribution is strictly dependent on the cell line, yet different localization has been reported. 83 However, in the process of T cell activation, it has been shown that an increase in intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free results primarily from lysosomal Zn 2+ release under upregulation of the ZIP8 transporter. 24 Regarding the investigation of overall intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free , it should be applicable, 32 but one should keep in mind that local [Zn 2+ ] free values may differ.\nPeptide models show that CD4ct and Lck-UD complex forms in the range of 10 \u00c014 -10 \u00c011 M of free Zn 2+ in solution. Incorporation of them into a model membrane shows that, indeed, the complex forms at 10 \u00c014 M, which suggests that it will not be affected by intracellular Zn 2+ fluctuations. However, the nature of Zn 2+ -based heterocomplex lets the concentration of its constituents regulate it. Therefore, simulations were introduced based on the stability constants reported for peptide models. 22,51 Apart from the fact that the stability data for Zn 2+ complexes of peptide models could be translated quantitatively into natural protein molecules and unknown protein concentrations, the simulations show that [Zn 2+ ] free alterations have a substantial impact on CD4 speciation and are able to change molar ratio between Zn(CD4)(Lck) and Zn(CD4) 2 species. A change of [Zn 2+ ] free between 0.1 and 10 nM leads to a substantial shift toward Zn(CD4) 2 formation. This notion is supported by the CD4 responsiveness to intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free between 0.1 and 0.6 nM observed for CD4 + Jurkat T cells. Although further increase of intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free could not be obtained, its higher values cannot be excluded, especially in a local manner. 32 Interestingly, the fraction of Zn(CD4)(Lck) persists at $25% in physiologically relevant free Zn 2+ concentrations. However, when we alter CD4, the fraction of homocomplex profile strongly depends on the free Zn 2+ status where changes in molar ratio occur. While increasing both CD4 and Lck, at a constant ratio, increase of Zn(CD4) 2 species occurs, with Zn(CD4)(Lck) being stable to these changes. Currently, the exact determination of CD4 and Lck level and therefore their Zn 2+ complexes is impossible. However, local concentration of CD4-Lck is increased in the immunological synapse. 11 It has also been reported that membrane signaling proteins of Jurkat T cells follow diffusional trapping that leads to an increase in their concentration and/or their exclusion, thanks to the formation of distinct microdomains such as CD2/LAT/Lck coclusters. 62 In addition, CD4 and the zinc clasp undergo different partitioning in the membrane subdomains and these processes were found to be correlated with TCR signaling. 43,69 It needs to be emphasized that these calculations are only approximations, and their purpose is to illustrate how dynamic the CD4/ Lck system is, and that various scenarios are possible. Very likely there are optimal conditions that enhance the formation of the heterocomplex or promote formation of the homocomplex. Other processes, such as membrane partitioning and/or immune synapse formation, might also affect the local availability of CD4/Lck. Furthermore, it is possible that CD4 palmitoylation, being a reversible process, is highly involved. A complete understanding of the role that CD4, Lck, and Zn 2+ play in T cell activation needs further investigation.\n**STAR+METHODS**\nDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: \n\n**METHOD DETAILS**\n**Peptide synthesis**\nPeptides were synthesized on a solid-phase support using the Fmoc strategy on TentaGel R RAM Amide Rink resin from Rapp Polymere GmbH (0.18 mmol/g substitution) and a Liberty 1 Microwave Assisted Peptide Synthesizer (CEM) according to the previous published procedures. 85 Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-(Dmb)-Gly-OH dipeptide was used for the synthesis of Lck peptide in order to prevent aspartimide formation. N-termini of peptides were acetylated with acetate anhydride (8 equiv.) or myristylated with myristic acid (10 eq.) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA, 10 equiv). On-resin coupling of FAM and TAMRA (4 equiv.) to the N-terminus was performed with COMU (4 equiv.) and DIEA in DMF (10 equiv). GSS linker at the N terminus was applied before FAM (Table S1). Palmitoylation of CD4ct was performed using orthogonal coupling via Fmoc-Cys(Mtt)-OH. Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-OH was used to introduce FAM or TAMRA at the C terminus of CD4ct and Lck. The 4-methyltrityl protecting group (Mtt) was removed with 1% TFA in DCM (dichloromethane) for 15 min (5 times). Resin cleavage was performed with a mixture of TFA/EDT/thioanisole/anisole/TIPS/H2O (86:3:5:2:2:2, v/v/v/v/v/v) over a period of 4 h. After evaporation of the solution to the minimum volume under nitrogen atmosphere, peptides were precipitated with cold diethyl ether (\u00c020 C). Crude peptide pellets were centrifuged (4 C) and washed with cold diethyl ether (5-7 times) to get rid of the excess of scavengers. Peptide crudes were stored at \u00c020 C and non-cleaved resins after drying under a vacuum pump at 4 C. Peptide purification was performed on an Aeris 3.6 mm PEPTIDE XB-C18 column (Phenomenex) with a gradient of acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA using the Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Scientific). The identity of peptides was confirmed with an API 2000 Applied Biosystems ESI-MS instrument and the identified mass values with peptides sequences are listed in Table S1. Concentration of peptide stocks in 10 mM HCl was determined using a sulfhydryl group reactant, 5,5 0 -dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, \u03b5 = 14,150 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 at 412 nm), prior to each experiment. 51,86 Concentrations of peptides labeled with FAM and TAMRA fluorophores were determined using fluorophores' molar absorption coefficients: l ex (FAM) = 492 nm, \u03b5 492nm = 79,000 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 in 0.1 M NaOH and l ex (TAMRA) = 555 nm, \u03b5 555nm = 65,000 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 in 6 M Gdn$HCl (guanidine hydrochloride) at pH 8.0. 87 \n**Molecular cloning**\nNucleotide sequences of the gene encoding CD4(wt) and Lck(wt) proteins were purchased as pUC plasmids from ATG:biosynthetics GmbH, Germany (Table S4). Designed primers were terminated with nucleotide sequences encoding restriction enzyme sites (Table S3) and CD4(wt), Lck(wt), Lck(UD) were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Thermal Cycler T100 (Bio-Rad). PCR products were cleaned (GeneJET PCR Purification Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Double-stranded DNA fragments were amplified along with expression vectors (pcDNA-mRuby2 and pcDNA-Clover, Addgene #40260 and #40259, respectively). pcDNA-mRuby2 plasmid was mutated to change the BamHI restriction site to KpnI and avoid the change of the reading frame (Table S3). In addition, two nucleotides were inserted to change the encoding linker sequence between Lck and mRuby2 from the -VP-amino acid fragment to -GTG-amino acids. Mutagenesis was performed according to the published protocol. 88 Inserts and plasmids were digested at the manufacturer's conditions (4 h, 37 C), run on agarose gel (1-2%), isolated, and purified (GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Inserts were then ligated with linearized plasmids using T4 DNA ligase for 1 h at 22 C (5 U/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ligation mixtures were transformed into the chemically competent E. coli DH5a strain. Selected colonies were cultured in LB medium with 100 mg/mL ampicillin and DNA was isolated (GeneJET Endo-Free Plasmid Maxiprep Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Introduction of nucleotide sequences was confirmed with commercial sequencing (Genomed S.A., Microsynth AG).\nThe plasmid encoding Lck(wt)-mRuby2 was additionally mutagenized to replace Zn 2+ -binding cysteinyl(s) for alanine(s); thus the 20 CENC 23 sequence was mutagenized to AENC and AENA, which have been abbreviated as 'Lck(1Ala)' and 'Lck(12Ala)'. Mutagenesis was performed according to the published protocol. 88 Formation of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) Liposomes were prepared by the lipid film hydration-extrusion method. POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine) 25 mg/mL stock solution was prepared in chloroform in a glass vial. It was stored at \u00c020 C, tightly sealed. To prepare LUVs, 1 mg/mL POPC mixture was evaporated under nitrogen and left for 1 h at low pressure. Thin lipid films were then hydrated with 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KNO 3 , pH 7.4. Five freeze/thaw cycles were performed in liquid nitrogen/warm water (40 C). The lipid mix was extruded through the polycarbonate 100 nm filter 15 times. Quality of LUVs was determined via dynamic light scattering in a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The mean diameter, polydispersity index and zeta potential of the prepared liposomes were approved. LUVs stock solution was kept at \u00c080 C.\nFluorescence measurements were taken in 1400 mL with 20 nM peptide(s) concentration and 0.15 or 0.0084 mg of POPC for high and low peptide(s) density (416 and 7412 molecules/mm 2 ), respectively. Density was calculated with the Avogadro's number of 6.022$10 23 , POPC molecular weight of 760.08 g/mol, the membrane area occupied by one lipid molecule 0.65 nm 2 and 90 nm inner diameter of a liposome which result in 52.6% of total lipids in the outer membrane surface. 52,60 As an example, the number of lipid molecules of 0.0084 mg POPC is 6.66$10 15 which gives in total 4.33$10 15 nm 2 and 2.28$10 9 mm 2 . Considering 1.69$10 13 fluorescent molecules in the cuvette, the surface density is 7412 molecules/mm 2 .\n**Formation of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs)**\nGUVs were prepared by electroformation from 1 mg/mL stock solution of POPC in chloroform. 6 mL of POPC solution was deposited onto the electrodes (two platinum wires), followed by evaporation of the organic solvent in a vacuum desiccator for 2 h. Sucrose-containing swelling buffer (216 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) was added to a Teflon chamber followed by immersion of electrodes. Swelling buffer was isosmotic (240 mOsm/kg) to the experimental buffer (50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KNO 3 , pH 7.4). Chambers were connected to a generator (NDN DF1641A, NDN Instrument) and exposed to a 2 V AC electric field for 2 h (1.5 h with 10 Hz, then 2 Hz). Prepared GUVs were used immediately.\n**Flotation experiments**\nFluorescently labeled protein domains (6 mM) were incubated with 300 mL LUVs and 450 mL of 50% sucrose for 30 min. Then, 2.5 mL of 15% sucrose was added on the top, followed by 1 mL of buffer (50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KNO 3 , pH 7.4). Tubes were ultracentrifuged for 2 h at 20,000 3 g. The high speed of centrifugation generates LUV disks at the top of a buffer layer where docked protein domains were present. Figure S1 presents the results of a flotation experiment, where the percentage of overall fluorescence was indicated for each of six collected fractions (700 mL each fraction). CD4(FAM) and Lck(TAMRA) samples were measured at 526 and 587 nm, respectively. Samples with myristoylated and fluorescently labeled domains possess a significantly higher percentage of fluorescence than the controls, indicating co-location of CD4(FAM) and Lck(TAMRA) in the LUV membrane model. Remaining fluorescence was observed in fraction no. 5-6 due to an excess of fluorescently labeled protein domain used in the experiment.\nZn 2+ -buffered system The series of 1 mM metal chelators (EDTA, HEDTA and EGTA) with different amounts of ZnSO 4 maintained [Zn 2+ ] free in the range of 10 \u00c015 -10 \u00c09 M Table S2 presents [Zn 2+ ] free and pZn values calculated at different ratios of zinc chelator to Zn 2+ using protonation and stability constants of the chelators 89 and HySS2009 software. 84 Zn 2+ -to-peptide transfer during equilibration was neglected in the calculations due to the insignificant pZn changes.\n**Zinc clasp domain reconstitution**\nZinc clasp assembly was reconstituted using LUVs and GUVs with fluorescence and fluorescence lifetime measurements, respectively. In LUV experiments, two surface densities of peptides were applied: 415 and 7412 molecules per mm 2 . In both conditions samples contained 20 nM peptides and 10 mM TCEP (50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KNO 3 , pH 7.4) but different number of LUVs: 0.1 and 0.006 mg/mL. Peptides' surface density was calculated with the membrane area occupied by one lipid molecule 0.65 nm 2 and 90 nm inner diameter of a liposome, which result in 52.6% of total lipids in the outer membrane surface. 52,60 Samples were incubated for 12 h prior to measurements. Concentrations of free Zn 2+ were in the range of 10 \u00c015 -10 \u00c09 M according to Table S2. Three repetitions were obtained. To visualize the zinc clasp domain in GUVs, a black 96-well glass-bottom plate (Greiner Bio-One, Kremsm\u20ac unster, Austria) was blocked with 2% BSA for 30 min, and subsequently washed with 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KNO 3 , pH 7.4. Next, 80 mL of buffer, then peptide(s) (2 mM) and 5 mL of POPC was added to the wells, gently pipetted, and equilibrated for 15 min prior to imaging. TCEP was added at a final concentration of 5 mM. Concentrations of free Zn 2+ were set as 10 \u00c014 , 10 \u00c012 and 10 \u00c09 M according to Table S2.\n**Circular dichroism spectroscopy**\nCircular dichroism spectra were recorded in the range of 200-270 nm in 20 mM Tris, 0.1 M NaF, 0.2% octylglucoside, pH 7.4 and 300 mM TCEP (Jasco J-1500, JASCO). Peptides were in 20 mM concentration. ZnSO 4 was titrated up to 2 M equivalents over peptides.\n**Competition with PAR probe**\nThe competition of peptides with the chromophoric metal chelator PAR for Zn 2+ (Equation 1) was performed by measuring the absorbance values of Zn(H x PAR) 2 at 492 nm (\u03b5 = 71,500 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 ) in each titration step including 3 min of equilibration. 90 All samples contained 100 mM PAR solution partially saturated with ZnSO 4 (10 mM) in 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KNO 3 , 400 mM TCEP, pH 7.4. Titration was performed in 20-30 steps up to 2.6 peptide equivalents over Zn 2+ . Stock solution of 20 mM PAR was prepared fresh in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution.\nZn\u00f0H x PAR\u00de 2 + CD4 + Lck$Zn\u00f0CD4\u00de\u00f0Lck\u00de + 2H x PAR (Equation 1)\n**Fluorimetry**\nTo monitor complex formation and determine apparent dissociation constants of Zn(CD4ct)(Lck-UD) and Zn(CD4ct(p))(Lck-UD), fluorescently labeled (FAM)CD4ct, (FAM)CD4(p) and (TAMRA)Lck-UD served as FRET pairs (FAM as donor and TAMRA as acceptor).\nMeasurements were performed at the constant temperature of 25 C with 492 nm excitation wavelength (2 nm) and 498-650 nm range in emission spectra (2 nm slit) in a quartz cuvette (Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer, Horiba). Peptide samples were prepared in 0.175 mM concentration (50 mM HEPES, 100 mM KNO 3 , 400 mM TCEP, pH 7.4) with zinc buffering in the [Zn 2+ ] free range of 10 \u00c015 -10 \u00c09 M (Table S2). Samples were incubated for 12 h and measurements were performed as three averaged scans. The ratio of donor to acceptor intensities at 525 and 573 nm was calculated for each experimental point (Table S5) and obtained data were fitted to the logarithmic version of Hill's equation (Equation 2), where y min and y max refer to minimal and maximal intensities, [Zn 2+ ] 0.5 stands for free Zn 2+ concentration where half of the complex is formed, and n is the cooperativity factor. Data were normalized using y min and y max as borders in 0-1 normalization.\n**Confocal microscopy**\nTo determine the interaction between CD4ct and Lck-UD on the model membrane, fluorescence lifetime microscopy (FLIM), which enables quantification of FRET efficiency by measurement of the fluorescence lifetime of the donor, was used (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta).\nConfocal images of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) that contained CD4ct(FAM) (or CD4ct(p)(FAM)) and Lck-UD(TAMRA) were gathered. For each sample, at least 10 different liposomal vesicles were chosen and imaged. Samples were excited at 488 nm for the donor and the FRET channel, and 561 nm to visualize TAMRA-containing GUVs. For donor detection, a 505 nm longpass filter was applied. Only GUVs with optimal relative fluorescence intensities of both FAM and TAMRA were imaged (403 water immersion objective with the numerical aperture of 1.2). The efficiency of peptide incorporation was assessed by plotting fluorescence intensity across single vesicle as shown on exemplary plot profile (Figure S11). FLIM-FRET measurements were acquired by time-correlated single-photon counting with the same microscope equipped with FLIM optics (PicoQuant). Samples were excited at 470 nm and the emission was collected with a 503-521 nm filter set. Laser power was adjusted not to exceed 900 photons/s. Images were recorded in a 512 3 512 format and the fluorescence lifetime was calculated for each pixel. Data analysis was done with the SymPhoTime software (PicoQuant). Each picture represented a GUV that was colored according to the average fluorescence lifetime. Data analysis of FLIM-FRET included fitting of the fluorescence lifetime decay and the instrument response function to the single exponential decay model.\n**Electroporation of Jurkat T cells and their selection for CD4 expression**\nThe day before electroporation cells were counted and adjusted to 3-5 3 10 5 cells/ml. On the electroporation day, cells were counted and centrifuged (300 3 g, 5 min, 7 C). For one electroporation experiment 5-10 3 10 6 cells were washed (10 mL) and resuspended in 300 mL of cold RPMI-1640 media without FCS and Pen/Str. Cells were put into an electroporation cuvette and stored on ice for 10-20 min prior to addition of plasmids (10-20 mg). Electroporation was performed with 300 V and 0.95 mF for 10-11 s for plasmid transfection and 8-9 s for control cells. Gentle shaking was applied before and after electroporation. After electroporation, cells were transferred to 3.5 mL of pre-warmed RPMI-1640 medium (37 C, 20% FCS, without Pen/Str). After 16-24 h, cells were diluted twice with standard RPMI-1640 medium. Cells were put under selection with 1.0 mg/mL G418 antibiotic in case of CD4 transfection or used 48-72 h after Lck transfection.\n**Fluorescence microscopy**\nFluorescence microscopy of CD4 + Jurkat T cells was performed using the Axio Observer.Z1 with Plan-Apochromat 203/0.8 M27 objective (ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany). Cells were imaged in three channels: Clover-Clover (excitation: 488 nm, emission: 525 nm filter with 25 nm bandpass) mRuby2-mRuby2 (excitation: 553 nm, emission: 605 nm filter with 35 nm bandpass) Clover-mRuby2 (excitation: 488 nm, emission: 605 nm filter with 35 nm bandpass). After transfection (48 h or 72 h) of the CD4 + Jurkat T cell line with Lck plasmids cells were centrifuged at 4 C and half of the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) three times. The second half was used for FRET studies. Cells were resuspended in 100 mL and centrifuged using a cytocentrifuge (500 3 g, 5 min).\n**Preparation of growth media with different free Zn 2+ concentrations**\nTo investigate the influence of Zn 2+ on the CD4 level at the cell surface differently, Zn 2+ -composed media were prepared. To chelate Zn 2+ from the media Chelex 100 resin was used (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 2.5 g of Chelex 100 per 50 mL of medium was weighed and soaked in the medium for 1 h with gentle stirring. The first portion of medium was discarded and regeneration of the Chelex 100 resin was performed. To do that 1 M HCl was added and soaked for 1 h with rolling. The fluid was discarded and the Chelex 100 resin was incubated with 1 M NaOH for 1 h with rolling. The solution was discarded and the Chelex 100 resin was washed with water for 15 min. Chelex resin was resuspended in water and stored at 4 C prior to use. 50 mL of media was added to regenerated Chelex 100 resin and incubated for 1 h. After the separation of the media from the resin, Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ were supplemented by the addition of 12.5 mL of 2 M CaCl 2 and 100 mL of 0.2 M MgCl 2 . pH was adjusted to 7.4 and the media were sterile filtered (0.2 mm filter). Metal-free media (chelexed) were replenished with different 0.2-8 mM concentrations of Zn 2+ and a metal-buffered system was applied to obtain higher values of pZn (lower [Zn 2+ ] free ). As the Zn 2+ metal buffer 1 mM HEDTA with 2 mM Ca 2+ and 2 mM Mg 2+ was applied with the Zn 2+ concentration in the range of 0.1-0.4 mM. For the lower value of pZn (higher [Zn 2+ ] free ) media supplementation (not treated with Chelex 100 resin) was applied with Zn 2+ in the range of 0-100 mM. Cells were harvested in the prepared media for 24 h prior to analysis.\n**FACS analysis**\nTo analyze CD4 overexpression in the Jurkat T cell line after transfection and during the selection with G418 antibiotic the PE-CD4 antibody was used (mouse anti-human CD4-PE clone SK3, Becton Dickinson). The level of CD4 expression level per cell and the total number of cells expressing CD4 can be obtained. To stain CD4 surface molecules 1310 6 cells/ml were transferred to the FACS tube, centrifuged, and washed twice with cold PBS (300 3 g, 5 min). The pellet was resuspended in 100 mL of cold PBS with 2% FCS. PElabeled CD4 antibody and its isotype control (mouse IgG1,k conjugated with PE, Becton Dickinson) were added (5 mL) and incubated in the dark for 30-45 min on ice to minimize internalization. Samples were washed twice with cold PBS (300 3 g, 5 min) and resuspended in 300 mL of PBS with 2% FCS for analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with at least three samples using one-way ANOVA and the post-hoc Tukey test with Origin software. CD4(Clover) and Lck(mRuby2) served as the FRET pair and the mean fluorescence of cells was gathered in three channels: donor (488 nm excitation, 530/30 nm emission), acceptor (561 nm excitation, 610/ 20 nm emission), and FRET (488 nm excitation, 610/20 nm emission). Measurements were done on FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and BD FACSCanto instruments. Analysis was performed with FlowJo BD and NovoCyte Agilent software.\nDetermination of intracellular free Zn 2+ concentration Intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free was measured with the specific fluorescent zinc sensor FluoZin-3. Its ester form (FluoZin3-AM) is able to permeate cell membranes, being afterward hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases that restore FluoZin-3 that is trapped inside the cell, therefore being able to detect intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free . The reported value of the conditional dissociation constant (K d ) of the Zn 2+ -selective sensor FluoZin-3 is 8.04 nM at pH 7.4 with excitation and emission maxima at 494 nm and 517 nm, respectively 52 To determine [Zn 2+ ] free two borderline samples were measured, one containing 50 mM zinc chelator TPEN (N,N,N 0 ,N 0 -tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine) and the other containing 100 mM ZnSO 4 with 5 mM ionophore pyrithione (ZnPyr) for determination of minimal and maximal Zn 2+ levels, respectively. The [Zn 2+ ] free was calculated according to the formula: [Zn 2+ ] free = K d 3 ((F-F min )/(F max -F)) where F min and F max are fluorescence emission values for the samples treated with TPEN and ZnPyr, respectively. Cells were prepared in 1 mL of PBS (1310 6 cells). FluoZin3-AM stock solution (1 mM in DMSO) was added at a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were incubated at 37 C for 30 min with shaking. Then cells were centrifuged (300 3 g, 5 min), supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS. The cell suspension was divided into three equal samples. For the minimal zinc sample, 7.5 mL of 2 mM TPEN was added and for the maximal zinc sample 3 mL of 10 mM ZnSO 4 and 3 mL of 5 mM ZnPyr were added. Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 C. Single cell fluorescence intensities were detected by FACS analysis. [Zn 2+ ] free was calculated as indicated above. Estimations of intracellular Zn 2+ levels were done on non-transfected cells due to high fluorescence emission overlay. Experiments were performed in parallel with the determination of CD4 expression on the cell surface.\n**Intracellular staining of CD4**\nIntracellular staining was performed to estimate the overall level of CD4 protein in a cell under zinc supplementation (Intracellular Fixation & Permeabilization Buffer Set, Thermo Fisher). 100 mL of fixation buffer was added to 1310 6 cells/ml, vortexed and incubated for 20-30 min. Then cells were washed with 1 mL of permeabilization buffer with 2% FCS and centrifuged (300 3 g, 5 min). Cells were resuspended in 100 mL of Permeabilization Buffer, followed by CD4-PE antibody addition (10 mL) and incubation in the dark for 20 min.\nAfter washing with 1 mL of Permeabilization Buffer and re-suspension in 300 mL of PBS, cells were subjected to analysis.\n**Stimulation of Jurkat T cell line**\nAfter transfection of the CD4 + Jurkat T cell line with Lck (48 h or 72 h) plasmids cells were centrifuged at 4 C and washed with cold RPMI-1640 media without FCS and Pen/Str. Half of the cells were re-suspended in 300 mL of fresh medium (No FCS, No Pen/Str) and divided into 3 tubes. 100 mL of stimulation hybridoma and 50 mL of CD28 were added to each tube and incubated for 3 min. Stimulation hybridoma and CD28 was kindly gifted from Prof. Luca Simeoni (Molecular and Clinical Immunology, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg). To stop the reaction, 1 mL of cold PBS was quickly added. Cells were centrifuged (4 C, 300 3 g, 5 min) and resuspended in 100 mL of cold PBS and stored on ice until analyzed.\n**Simulations**\nAll calculations of species distributions were performed using HySS software 84 using Zn 2+ stability constants determined in competition experiments in our previous report. 22,50 According to that, the conditional formation constant (logK 12 ) of Zn(CD4ct)(Lck-UD) and Zn(CD4ct) 2 is 19.47 and 14.07, respectively. In all calculations, free Zn 2+ was kept at constant values by introducing a virtual chelating agent (L) that forms with Zn 2+ a 1:1 complex (ZnL). Its apparent formation constant varied depending on the required pZn value. For instance, distribution of Zn(CD4ct)(Lck), Zn(CD4ct) 2 , and metal-free CD4ct species was calculated by the introduction of 1.0 mM of virtual chelating agents, whose logK ZnL at pH 7.4 was equal to the required pZn value. The total Zn 2+ concentration was maintained at 0.5 mM.\n**QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS**\nOne-Way ANOVA with Tukey test was used to assess statistical significance. Calculation was done by OriginPro 8.1 software. Significances are indicated as follows: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001.\n\n\nHighlights d Variable free Zn2+ concentration-dependent formation of CD4 and Lck complexes d Interplay between Zn(CD4)2 and Zn(CD4)(Lck) in the presence of free Zn 2+\n\n",
