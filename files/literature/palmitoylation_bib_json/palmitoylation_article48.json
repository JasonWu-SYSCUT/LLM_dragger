    "fullText": "**Introduction**\nPost-translational modifications of proteins greatly influence the structure and functions of proteins [1][2][3]. Typically, palmitoylation plays an important role in regulating protein bioactivities, intracellular and intercellular trafficking, as well as stability [4][5][6][7]. Studying the palmitoylated state of proteins and their intracellular dynamics are of great significance in the verification of complex signaling pathways and adjustment of space and time. Yet investigation of cellular protein functions and trafficking through palmitoylation remain a significant challenge partially owing to a lack of tools.\nOver the past few years, several biochemical methods have been developed for protein-specific palmitoylation analysis. For example, Hannoush et al. proposed a strategy for imaging the Wnt palmitoylation based on bioorthogonal probes and proximity ligation [8]. Similarly, Hannoush et al. reported a click-chemistry-based palmitate probes combined with proximity ligation on antibodies to the click-conjugated dye for visualizing palmitoylated cellular proteins [9]. The metabolic palmitic acid labeling technique is a powerful tool for protein-specific palmitoylation visualization. Recently, a trans-membrane forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) strategy was investigated to image cell surface receptor palmitoylation through metabolic labeling and targeted labeling from a FRET donor-acceptor pair [10]. As a talented tool, FRET has been widely applied to intermolecular interactions analysis and protein structure exploration.\nHowever, there are still several setbacks that need to be addressed for FRET application. First, the FRET efficiency depends on the donoracceptor separation distance with a range of 1-10 nm [11,12]. Given the membrane itself possessing a thickness of about 4 nm, trans-membrane FRET significantly compromises the FRET efficiency for a cell surface receptor when the donor and acceptor located at different sides of membrane. Besides, the rigid spherical structure and big size of antibodies may not be favorable for FRET on account of dispersive fluorophore. Also, the antibody recognition site and palmitoylation site are usually distributed in different sides of membrane for a cell surface receptor, which greatly hinders the measurement via FRET.\nTo facilitate the occurrence of FRET phenomenon, labeling of target protein with small size and flexible ligands provides an effective alternative. Besides, the cis-membrane FRET is necessary for ensuring the effectiveness of FRET. Toward this goal, we herein proposed a hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-based cis-membrane multi-FRET for amplified visualization of PD-L1 palmitoylation in situ. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the azido-palmitic acid (azido-PA) was metabolic incorporated into cellular palmitoylated proteins, followed by reaction with dibenzylcylooctyne-modified Cy5 (DBCO-Cy5) through copper-free click chemistry. For PD-L1 targeted labeling, we employed a reported peptide from huntingtin interacting protein 1 that possesses strong binding ability with PD-L1 [13,14]. Also, the binding site of PD-L1 binging peptide (PBP) and PD-L1 is located at cytosolic domain of PD-L1, which is in the same side as PD-L1 palmitoylation site. Therefore, targeted labeling PD-L1 with PBP allows the cis-membrane FRET. To further enhance the efficiency of FRET, we designed a short DNA strand (H0) conjugated with PBP (P-H0), which could act as an initiator strand to trigger a non-enzyme HCR amplification process under room temperature. The amplified labeling of PD-L1 targeted protein produced more fluorophore to trigger multi-FRET signal, which effectively improved the sensitivity for imaging of palmitoylated PD-L1.\n\n**Materials and methods**\n**Materials**\nAll DNA oligonucleotide sequences and PD-L1 binding peptide conjugated H0 (P-H0) were synthesized and purified by Sangon Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The sequences were showed in Table S1. Azido-palmitic acid (azido-PA) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Cambridge, MA, USA). Antibody for PD-L1 was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, USA). Antibody against GAPDH was purchased from Sino Biological (Beijing, China). Salmon sperm DNA and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) were obtained from Solarbio Life Sciences (Beijing, China). PD-L1 wild-type and mutated plasmids (C272A) were constructed by GeneChem Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). DBCO-Cy5 was purchased from Xi'an Ruixi Technology Co., Ltd. (Xian, China). Protease inhibitors and ML348 were purchased from TargetMol (Boston, MA, USA). 2-Bromopalmitate (2-BP) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 was purchased from Thermofisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA).\n**Cell culture and metabolic labeling**\nMDA-MB-231, MCF-7, BT-474 and SKBR-3 cell lines were all purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were pretreated with 100 \u03bcM azido-PA for 24 h in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37 \u2022 C. Then the azido groups were metabolically incorporate onto the cell protein.\n**Preparation of DNA oligonucleotide and peptide**\nPrior to use, all oligonucleotide sequences were dissolved in DPBS-Mg buffer (DPBS with 5 mM MgCl 2 ) and heated for 5 min at 95 \u2022 C, then slowly cooled down to room temperature to allow sequences to form energetically favorable secondary structures. The PBP and P-H0 were dissolved in PBS buffer and stored at -80 \u2022 C.\n**Agarose gel electrophoresis**\nAgarose gel electrophoresis was used to confirm the feasibility of HCR. 1 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM H0, 5 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM H1 and 5 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM H2 were mixed to form the HCR production at 37 \u2022 C for 30 min. Then agarose gels (2%) electrophoresis in 1 \u00d7 TBE buffer was performed at 100 V for min and stained with GelRed stain solution (Sangon, Shanghai, China). Subsequently, the gel was visualized with imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n**Cellular cytotoxicity assays**\nMDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in 96-well plate and incubated with 100 \u03bcM Azido-PA for 24 h or 48 h, respectively. Then the cells were washed by PBS for three times, CCK-8 solution and fresh culture medium mixture were added and incubated for 1 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Model 680 microplate reader (Bio-Rad, USA).\n**Imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation with cis-membrane Multi-FRET**\nFor metabolic PA labeling, MDA-MB-231 cell were seeded onto confocal dishes and incubated with 100 \u03bcM azido-PA for 24 h before treatments. Then the cells were washed 3 times with cold DPBS and incubated with 100 nM H1 and 100 nM H2 for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C. After washed with DPBS, the cells were incubated with 100 nM H1 and nM H2 for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C. Finally, the fluorescence was observed using a laser confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8, Germany) with a 40 \u00d7 objective. The Cy3 fluorescence signal was excited by 552 nm laser and collected with a 560-610 nm filter. The Cy5 fluorescence signal was excited by 638 nm laser and collected with a 650-700 nm filter. The FRET fluorescence signal was excited by 552 nm laser and collected with a 650-700 nm filter. For feasibility of metabolic labeling, MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured with 100 \u03bcM azido-PA for 24 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with 100 nM DBCO-Cy5 for 30 min. The final cells were measured by a CytoFLEX Flow Cytometer.\n**Flow cytometric analysis**\nFor PD-L1 palmitoylation analysis, the procedure was the same as that described in the previous \"Imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation with cis-membrane Multi-FRET\" The final cells were measured by a Cyto-FLEX Flow Cytometer.\n**Plasmid transfection**\nBT-474 cells were seeded onto 6-well plate and grown to approximately 70-90% confluence. The plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 reagent were respectively diluted with Opti-MEM medium. Then the diluted DNA and diluted Lipofectamine\u00ae 2000 reagent were mixed and incubated for 15 min to produce stable plasmid DNA-lipid complexes. Afterwards, the complexes were added into the cells and cultured for 48 h.\n**Western blotting**\nWhole protein from breast cancer cells were harvested with RIPA buffer containing proteinase inhibitor. 30 \u03bcg of total proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBST for 2 h, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody at 4 \u2022 C overnight. Subsequently, the membrane was incubated with HRP-labeled corresponding secondary antibody and measured by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n**In vivo imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation with cis-membrane Multi-FRET**\nIn short, female BALB/c nude mice (5-6 weeks) were purchased from Chongqing Teng Xin Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Chongqing, China) and used following protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of Chongqing Medical University. A total of 1 \u00d7 10 6 MDA-MB-231 cells in 100 \u03bcL PBS were subcutaneously injected into right flank of each mouse.\nWhen the tumors were grown to 100 mm 3 , the mice were treated with 50 mg/kg azido-PA for 3 days. Then 100 \u03bcL of P-H0 (25 mg/kg) and DBCO-Cy5 (25 mg/kg) were injected into the mice via the tail vein. After 1 h, 100 \u03bcL of H1 and H2 (25 mg/kg) were injected as before. Finally, the fluorescence was detected by a vivo imaging system (LB983 Night-OWLII, Berthold Technologies).\nFor tumors slice imaging, azido-PA-treated mice tumor were harvested and fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and then sliced into 4 \u03bcm sections. After dewaxing, the slices were blocked and processed as before. Y. Fu et al.\n**Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining**\nThe tumors-bearing mice sacrificed, tumors and main organs were excised and fixed in 4% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and then sliced into 4 \u03bcm sections. After dewaxing, the sections were stained using the H&E staining kit. The pathological changes in different organs were observed under a light microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti-s, Japan).\n**Statistical analysis**\nStudent's t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the differences between treated and control groups with Graph-Pad Prism 8.0.1. All quantitative results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) with at least three independent repetitive experiments.\n\n**Results and discussion**\n**Investigation of HCR and probe recognition**\nThe azido-PA was incorporated into cultured cells and ligated to palmitoylated proteins by metabolic labeling. We firstly investigated the cytotoxicity of azido-PA in response to the treatment concentration. As showed in Fig. 1A, no obvious viability changes were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells after co-incubation with azido-PA. Meanwhile, the formation of the HCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. In the presence of H0, H1 and H2, long smeared DNA polymers appeared, indicative of the initiation of HCR reaction (Fig. 1B).\nThe binding performance of targeted labeling probe (PBP) and metabolic labeling probe (DBCO-Cy5) are essential for FRET imaging palmitoylated PD-L1. Therefore, we verified the click chemistry reaction of azido-PA and DBCO-Cy5 as well as binding ability of PBP and PD-L1 by flow cytometry. As displayed in Fig. 1C, clear PBP fluorescence signals were observed in comparison with the control and random peptide. Meanwhile, there were strong Cy5 fluorescence signals after cells incubation with azido-PA (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that the PBP and DBCO-Cy5 both could attach onto the MDA-MB-231 cells by different approaches.\n**Imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation by cis-membrane multi-FRET**\nAs a proof of concept, we investigated the feasibility of visualization palmitoylated PD-L1 by cis-membrane multi-FRET. Cy3 and Cy5 are a FRET donor-acceptor pair, proved by the suitable overlap of Cy3 emission spectrum and Cy5 excitation spectrum (Fig. S1). As showed in Fig. 2A, bright FRET-induced Cy5 fluorescence was only observed after addition of P-H0 and azido-PA. In the case of specific labeling of PD-L1 or only palmitoylated protein, no measurable FRET signals was recorded. The FRET signals were also verified by flow cytometric. As showed in Fig. 2B, C and 2D, the P-H0 triggered HCR (P-H0-HCR) fluorescence \n**Verification of intramolecular FRET**\nAlthough FRET signals were detected through HCR amplification and metabolic labeling, it remains questionable whether the signals came from intramolecular FRET on the same protein as the signals may have been derived from the adjacent protein palmitoylation (intermolecular FRET). The intramolecular and intermolecular FRET for PD-L1 palmitoylation is schematically illustrated in Fig. 3A. Given these effects, we hypothesized that FRET signals from intramolecular FRET will disappearance if the palmitoylation of PD-L1 was abolished. Emerging studies reported that Cys272 might be the sole palmitoylation site of PD-L1 [15][16][17]. On this basis, substitution of the Cys272 residue by alanine (C272A) through mutagenesis completely abolished the palmitoylation of PD-L1 (Fig. 3B andS2). Consequently, breast cancer cell BT-474 (PD-L1 negative) was respectively transfected with PD-L1 wild type (WT) plasmid and C272A mutation plasmid. As showed in Fig. S3, the To further prove the observed signals from intramolecular FRET in a more convincing manner, we carried out acceptor photobleaching experiments to confirm the enhanced emission fluorescence of Cy3 after bleaching of the acceptor (Cy5) fluorescence. To this end, a portion of the cells was exposed to 638 nm laser to bleach the fluorescence of Cy5. Besides, the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence were independently recorded in previous bleaching and post bleaching. For C272A group, the mean value of Cy3 fluorescence intensity were essentially unaltered after bleaching of the Cy5 fluorescence (Fig. 3E andF). In contrast, the mean value of Cy3 fluorescence intensity were significantly increased as a consequence of Cy5 photobleaching in WT group (Fig. 3G andH). These results further indicated that the detected FRET signals were mostly derived from intramolecular FRET.\n**Enhanced effect of the HCR-based multi-FRET**\nIn general, the number of palmitoylation site is higher than the total number of the binding ligand for a particular palmitoylated protein, which would affect FRET efficiency. In view of this, we further propose a HCR-based multi-FRET method to improve FRET efficiency in imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation. In Fig. 4A, we compared the fluorescence intensity of single FRET and multi-FRET. The FRET signal with HCR amplification was much higher than that of the HCR free control. Furthermore, we observed the enhanced fluorescence intensity of Cy3 after bleaching of the Cy5 fluorescence. As is shown in Fig. 4B andC, the enhanced fluorescence intensity of Cy3 was weak after bleaching of the Cy5 fluorescence in the absence of HCR amplification. Conversely, the Cy3 fluorescence intensity were significantly increased after bleaching of the Cy5 fluorescence in the presence of HCR amplification (Fig. 4D andE). Those observation supported that Cy3 donors located on PD-L1 could contribute more to the FRET signals in the existence of HCR amplification.\nIn addition, we calculated the FRET efficiency with HCR or without HCR. FRET efficiency was calculated from the formula FRET efficiency = {(Cy3 post-bleaching -Cy3 pre-bleaching )/Cy3 post-bleaching } \u00d7 100. As is shown in Fig. 4F, the FRET efficiency with HCR was nearly 4 times higher than that without HCR, suggestive of the enhanced FRET efficiency via the HCR-based multi-FRET strategy.\n**Visualization PD-L1 palmitoylation in different breast cancer cells**\nTo further investigate the general applicability of as-proposed cismembrane multi-FRET method, we next employed the strategy to image PD-L1 palmitoylation in different breast cells. Previous studies reported the PD-L1 expression level in different breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cells with low expression of PD-L1; SK-BR-3 with moderate expression of PD-L1; BT-549 cells with high expression of PD-L1) [18][19][20]. Here, we selected the three breast cancer cells with different expression levels of PD-L1 and assessed PD-L1 expression by Western blot analysis, which were consistent with previous report (Fig. 5A andB).\nNext, palmitoylated PD-L1 was visualized through confocal microscopy imaging based cis-membrane multi-FRET strategy. As showed in Fig. 5C andD, weak FRET fluorescence signal was observed from MCF-7 cells, moderate FRET fluorescence signal was observed from SK-BR-3 cells, while BT-549 cells displayed bright FRET fluorescence signal. These results demonstrate that the proposed cis-membrane multi-FRET strategy is generally applicable and able to accurately recognize PD-L1 palmitoylation.\n**Analysis of PD-L1 palmitoylation under drug treatment**\nAlso, we evaluated the ability of the cis-membrane multi-FRET method invisualization the palmitoylation changes of target proteins under drug treatment. ML348, a selective inhibitors of acyl protein thioesterase 1, may increase the palmitoylation level of proteins [21,22]. Next, we treated MCF-7 cells with different concentrations of ML348. As shown in Fig. 6A andB, the FRET fluorescence intensity gradually enhanced along with the increased ML348 concentration, suggesting the PD-L1 palmitoylation level improvement. Interestingly, the Cy3 fluorescence intensity from PD-L1 also significantly increased through ML348 treatment in MCF-7 cells. Previous studies revealed palmitoylation of PD-L1 suppressed PD-L1 degradation by the lysosomal pathway and improve PD-L1 stability. Consistently, we noticed the level of PD-L1 elevated with ML348 treatment by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6C andD).\nLikewise, we inhibited protein palmitoylation level with a protein palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP. As expected, treatment by 2-BP obviously decreased the FERT fluorescence intensity in BT-549 cells (Fig. 6E andF). Similarly, the level of PD-L1 declined due to depalmitoylation promoting PD-L1 degradation (Fig. 6G andH). These results suggests that the cis-membrane multi-FRET method would serve as a potential drug screening method.\n**Imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation in vivo**\nFurther, we explored the ability of established cis-membrane multi-FRET method to visualize PD-L1 palmitoylation in vivo. As shown in Fig. 7A, azido-PA group displayed a significantly fluorescence signal in the tumor area in comparation with control group. Similarly, obvious FERT fluorescence signals were observed in azido-PA treatment mice tumor slice (Fig. 7B). In contrast, barely any FRET fluorescence signal was generated for non-treated mice tumor slice. Moreover, different treatment group mice tumors were extracted and digested into single cell suspension to analyze PD-L1 palmitoylation by flow cytometric. As shown in Fig. 7C, D and7E, the FERT fluorescence signals could only be observed in azido-PA treated mice tumor cells, indicating the cis-membrane multi-FRET strategy effective recognition of palmitoylated PD-L1 in tumor sample.\nIn addition, H&E staining showed no pathological changes were observed in different organs (Fig. 7F), indicating that azido-PA is a safe and effective metabolic labeling strategy.  \n\n**Conclusions**\nIn conclusion, we proposed a cis-membrane multi-FRET for amplified visualization of specific palmitoylated proteins through metabolic labeling and targeted recognition. The cis-membrane labeling method enables effective intramolecular donor-acceptor distance and allow to increase FRET efficiency. Simultaneously, HCR amplification triggered multi-FRET phenomenon with significantly improved FRET efficiency. The strategy has achieved the enhanced FRET imaging of palmitoylated PD-L1 and visualizing the palmitoylation changes of PD-L1 under drug treatment. Furthermore, as-established method successfully amplified visualization of PD-L1 palmitoylation in vivo and mice tumor slice. We envision our strategy would provide a useful alternative for the imaging of other palmitoylated protein or other types of post-translational modification.\n**Credit author statement**\nYixin Fu: research design; performing the experiments; Writing -Original Draft, Husun Qian: performing the experiments; Literature \n\n\nPalmitoylation plays an important role in modulating protein trafficking, stability, and activity.
