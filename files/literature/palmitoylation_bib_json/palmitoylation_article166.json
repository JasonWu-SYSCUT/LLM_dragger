Under normal physiological conditions, immune checkpoint molecules can effectively adjust the immune system and prevent excessive autoimmune diseases. But the immune escape occurs when the immune checkpoint molecules are overexpressed or overactivated, such as a cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28), programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4). Cancer cells can utilize immune escape to prevent the immune attack and be cleared by the immune cells, which results in the body's inability to control the growth of tumors. Among them, PD-L1 is an essential immune checkpoint protein in cancer cells that can bind to PD-1 to inhibit the proliferation and activity of T cells, causing tumor immunosuppression [1][2][3]. Therefore, restoring immunity by interrupting PD-1 and PD-L1 can increase the number of cancer cells killed by immune cells. The current popular cancer immunotherapy is to develop immune checkpoint inhibitors. Up until now, the FDA has given its approval to several monoclonal antibodies that specifically target the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, including PD-L1 mAbs (such as Durvalumab and Atezolizumab) and PD-1 mAbs (such as Camrelizumab, Tislelizumab) [4][5][6][7]. Therapy with PD-1/PD-L1 mAbs has been crucial in patient care and drug therapy across multiple cancer types [8].\nIn recent years, a series of biological or chemical molecules targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction have been reported [9]. Therein, small-molecule drug candidates that inhibit PD-1/PD-L1 have been greatly improved [10]. For instance, the phenoxymethyl-biphenyl compound of Incyte Corporation (INCB86550, 1) (Fig. 1) and Tianjin Chase Sun Pharmaceutical (IMMH-010, 2) (Fig. 1) are undergoing different phases of clinical trials now [11,12].\nHowever, almost all existing drugs and candidates can only bind PD-L1 on the cell surface of cancer cells. In fact, PD-L1 can also be found in the Golgi apparatus, microvesicles, and endosomes, which can supplement and update the surface PD-L1 [13,14]. Both whole-cell and endogenous PD-L1 have tumor-promoting effects, which may be one of the reasons for some current drug resistance [14][15][16]. Therefore, the complete elimination of PD-L1 on the surface and intracellularly in cancer cells should be a valid immunotherapy approach. There are currently some ways that targeting PD-L1 protein degradation or suppressing the expression of PD-L1 can restore the immune effects on tumors [17,18]. It can sometimes serve as a potential adjunct treatment targeting PD-1 and PD-L1. Herein, we will review the regulation of some reagents, antibodies, or drug candidates on the PD-L1 degradation of the PD-L1 protein. At the same time, we have classified the methods of degrading PD-L1 according to the degradation mode, hoping to provide another concept for targeting PD-L1 and indirectly accelerate the blossom of immunotherapy.\n\n**PD-L1 degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosomal pathways**\nThere are many natural protein degradation mechanisms in cells that can degrade misfolded or unwanted proteins or organelles and recycle the released amino acids. The two major routes for protein degradation in eukaryotic cells are the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the lysosomal degradation pathway [19]. UPS is the most important protein degradation pathway with high specificity and selectivity in human cells and mainly includes two processes: ubiquitination of substrate proteins and proteasome degradation of ubiquitin-labeled proteins. Ubiquitin (Ub) is a polypeptide composed of 76 amino acids that widely exists in eukaryotic cells and can be covalently bound to substrate proteins with the help of E3 ubiquitin ligases, the tagged protein can be recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome or prevented from degradation under the catalysis of deubiquitinase (DUB) [20,21]. In addition to the above, when proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are misfolded (such as abnormal glycosylation status), they will be recognized by specific E3 enzymes and retrogradely transported to the cytoplasm, where they will be ubiquitinated and then degraded by the proteasome [22]. This pathway is the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which is also an important degradation method of UPS. While lysosome degradation, as a non-specific protein degradation pathway, is mainly based on two mechanisms: endocytosis and autophagy, which to some extent, supplement the deficiency of UPS and can participate in the degradation of extracellular protein, intact organelles, and protein polymers of surface membrane proteins [23,24]. The two pathways can not only compensate for or cooperate with each other but also function independently to ensure the specific degradation of intracellular substances [25].\nTargeted protein degradation technology (TPD) is a new approach that interferes with the function of proteins by utilizing the inherent degradation mechanism of regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells. TPD provides a brand-new regulatory strategy and research tool for nonpharmaceutical targets, which greatly expands the space for new drug design and makes the treatment of intractable diseases possible [26,27].\nHere, using the ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosome systems to degrade PD-L1 would be a meaningful strategy. In recent years, various new targeted protein degradation technologies have emerged, including molecular glue, Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), photoswitchable PROTAC (PhotoPROTAC), autophagy-targeting chimera (AUTAC), autophagosome-tethering compound (ATTEC),\nChaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and AUTOphagy-TArgeting Chimera (AUTOTAC) [28][29][30][31][32][33][34]. Adopting different strategies to degrade or manipulate PD-L1 protein using multiple techniques is a significant expansion of the research on the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Many methods have been reported to degrade PD-L1, such as PROTAC-like molecules [35], lysosomal targeted chimera (LYTAC) [36], etc. These strategies allow PD-L1 proteins to be damaged by proteasomes or lysosomes, thus improving immunotherapy efficacy. In this article, we refer to these agents that target PD-L1 degradation as designed PD-L1 degraders. Correspondingly, some other PD-L1 degraders that are not specifically designed but have other functions are called multifunctional PD-L1 degraders. Among them, the designed PD-L1 degrader is mainly degraded by the lysosome, while the multifunctional PD-L1 degrader exists in both proteasome and lysosomal degradation, and some drugs even work in two degradation modes at the same time. The summary of degradation pathways helps us find new technologies for the degradation of proteins and organelles, and finds that PD-L1 degraders have good prospects in immunotherapy.\n**Designed PD-L1 degraders**\n**PROTAC and PROTAC-like bifunctional compounds**\nIn 2020, Chen's group designed a series of bifunctional small molecule inhibitors by combining biphenyl compounds of BMS with the E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRBN) ligand pomalidomide [35]. They found that these hybrid molecules have good inhibitory effects on the connection of human PD-1/PD-L1 with nanomole levels. Among these compounds, P22 (3) (Fig. 2) not only has strong inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 39.2 nM) but can also moderately reduce PD-L1 in breast cancer cells. According to the mechanistic study, it was found that 3 degrades PD-L1 via a pathway that is dependent on lysosomes (Fig. 3), which provides us with an idea of how PD-L1 can be degraded by a PROTAC-like molecule [35]. In 2021, Yang et al. designed a set of small-molecule PROTACs targeting PD-L1 based on the co-crystal structure of the PD-L1 small-molecule inhibitor BMS-37 (4) (Fig. 2) [37]. The authors connect the ligands of E3 with the ethanediamine side chain of BMS-37 by changing the length and type of linkers. Through the WB experiment, they found that compound 21a (5) (Fig. 2) has the best degradation effect on cytoplasm and membrane PD-L1 in different malignant cells. It can effectively promote the time-dependent degradation of the PD-L1 protein by relying on the proteasome (Fig. 3). In vivo studies have demonstrated that compound 5 effectively promotes immune cell activity and exerts inhibitory effects on tumor growth [37]. In 2022, Chen et al. combined biphenyl-like PD-L1 inhibitors and four E3 ubiquitin ligase ligands (CRBN, VHL, cIAP, and MDM2) through different linker chains to obtain 21 PD-L1 degraders [38]. Degradation studies and kinetic analysis revealed that compound BMS-37-C3 (6) (Fig. 2) exhibited the ability to induce time-and dose-dependent degradation of PD-L1 in A375 and B16-F10 cell lines. Both competition experiments and blocking experiments proved that 6 acts through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fig. 3) and is a reliable PD-L1 degrader. In addition, 6 was found to enhance the cytotoxicity of T cells against A375 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as demonstrated by the T cell co-culture killing assay [38].\nIn 2022, Fang's group developed a new integrin-facilitated lysosomal degradation (IFLD) strategy to exploit bifunctional compounds to degrade extracellular and membrane proteins [39]. Integrins, which are located on the surface of cells, are crucial receptors for mediating interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. Integrin \u03b1 v \u03b2 3 is highly expressed in a variety of tumor cells, and its recognition sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) has received extensive attention in tumor therapy [40]. In this study, the cyclic RGDyK (cRGD) with good stability and high hydrophilicity was selected as the integrin ligand to connect to the PD-L1 small molecule ligand, BMS-8 (7) (Fig. 2), through different linkers and three compounds synthesized [39]. Among these compounds, BMS-L1-RGD (8) (Fig. 2) has the best degradation rate of PD-L1. While the corresponding ligands, BMS-8 and cRGD, did not lead to significant degradation of PD-L1. The study has demonstrated that this degradation is dependent on lysosomal activity rather than the proteasome (Fig. 3). Finally, the compound has achieved a good anti-tumor effect and immune activation ability in vivo [39]. In general, this type of bifunctional molecule has the obvious effect of using integrin to degrade PD-L1 on the membrane. It not only has the advantages of small size and non-immunogenicity but also has great application prospects for other membrane proteins (Table 1).\n**LYTAC**\nIn 2020, Bartozzi ' s team developed a LYTAC platform that aimed at degrading extracellular and membrane-associated proteins [36]. This strategy obtained great success in the degradation of apolipoprotein E4, EGFR, CD71, and PD-L1. The LYTAC can utilize lysosome-targeting receptors (LTRs)-cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors (CI-M6PR) to transport membrane or extramembrane target proteins to lysosomes [41]. An antibody connects it with an affinity for the target protein and a chemically synthesized mannose-6-phosphate (M6P)-modified peptide, which is an agonist of CI-M6PR. After LYTACs combine with POI and CI-M6PR to form a complex, they are transported to the lysosome with CI-M6PR for POI degradation (Fig. 3) [36]. The authors designed and synthesized anti-PD-L1-M6Pn LYTAC (Ab-3). In the Hodgkin lymphoma cell line HDLM-2 with obvious CI-M6PR expression, the degradation ability of Ab-3 can reach up to 50%. When HDLM-2 cells were treated with atzolizumab-derived atz-M6Pn LYTAC at a concentration of 25 nM for 48 h, PD-L1 was downregulated by 73% [36] (Table 2). Although LYTAC still has challenges in preparation and safety, it has important development value for Fig. 2. PD-L1 PROTAC molecules (3, 5, 6, 8) and its parent molecules (4, 7).\nF. Zhang et al. degrading proteins on the membrane [42].\n**PD-LYSO**\nIn 2018, Xu et al. investigated the mechanism of PD-L1 lysosomal degradation using OncoBinder, an integrated approach that contains both genomic and proteomic techniques. They discovered and proved that Huntingtin-interacting protein 1-related (HIP1R) is a negative regulator of PD-L1 [43]. By constructing mutant HIP1R and green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins, the authors discovered a conserved domain (771-867) of HIP1R that binds PD-L1 and a sorting sequence (966-979) that binds to lysosomes. The sorting sequence has a di-leucine sequence that not only bound to the sorting adaptor protein (AP) complex for lysosomal sorting but also interacted with ESCRT and adaptor protein ALIX for internalization to the MVB or lysosome (Fig. 3) [43]. Based on the above findings, the authors constructed a PD-LYSO peptide by combining the PD-L1-binding motif of HIP1R (784-807) with its lysosome sorting sequence (966-979) in pcDNA3 expression vectors. It was found that PD-LYSO could significantly degrade PD-L1 in a lysosome-dependent manner within 2.5 h (Table 2). This work, leveraging the specific degradation mechanism of HIP1R, holds the potential to improve the precision and effectiveness of PD-L1 degradation methods, paving the way for advancements in therapeutic development and optimization [43].\n**AbTAC, PROTAB, and RSPO chimera**\nIn 2021, James A. Wells proposed recombinant bispecific antibodies (BsIgG) to degrade cell surface proteins based on PROTAC molecules (AbTAC) (Fig. 3) [44]. RNF43 is a transmembrane E3 ubiquitin ligase with a specific extracellular domain and an intracellular RING domain. The enzyme can ubiquitinate the target protein, thereby resulting in endocytosis and degradation of the target protein. They screened the peptides that can bind to RNF43 efficiently by phage display. Then the recombinant bispecific antibody AC-1 was constructed by using Atezolizumab as the ligand of PD-L1 and fusing it with the binding fragment of RNF43. In MDA-MB231 cells, 10 nM AC-1 could degrade 63% of the PD-L1 protein within 24 h (Table 2) [44]. In addition, lysosomal acidification inhibitors (bafilomycin) can stop AC-1-induced degradation of PD-L1, but proteasome inhibitors (MG-132) can't. These results show that the mechanism of PD-L1 degradation by AC-1 is RNF43-and lysosomal-dependent manner [44]. In addition, the research group expanded the E3 ligase, using the transmembrane ubiquitinase ZNRF3, to obtain a good PD-L1-degrading AbTAC in the next year [45]. Similarly, Genentech researchers designed a bispecific antibody-based PROTAB technology that targets PD-L1 at one end and the N-terminal glycoprotein D of RNF43 or ZNRF3 at the other end, which can effectively degrade PD-L1 in SW48 xenografts (Atezo*ZNRF3-55) (Fig. 3), but unlike AbTAC, its degradation pathway relies on the dual pathways of proteasome and lysosome [46]. In view of the excellent ability of ZNRF3/RNF43 to degrade PD-L1, more and more researchers have \n**Table 1**\nThe degradation characteristics of PROTAC and PROTAC-like bifunctional compounds. PD-L1 is internalized and undergoes integrin-facilitated lysosomal degradation (IFLD). [39] conducted in-depth research on these transmembrane ligases. The Niehrs' group mutated the R-spondins (RSPOs) family member RSPO2, which has the best binding interaction for ZNRF3, to obtain mutant R2FA. Subsequent mutations in the extracellular IgV-like domain of PD-1 produced PD1HAC, the unit that has a high affinity for PD-L1. Finally, R2FA binds to the PD1HAC module through a flexible glycine-serine linker to generate the bispecific RSPO2 chimera (R2PD1) [47]. R2PD1 efficiently degrades overexpressed and endogenous PD-L1 in melanoma cells in a lysosome-and ZNRF3/RNF43-dependent manner. Finally, R2PD1 restored T-cell activation in a dose-dependent manner and was much more potent than Atezolizumab at the same concentration [47]. The degradation efficiency of AbTAC, PROTAB, and RSPO2 chimera was relatively high, which optimizes the shortcomings of cell surface proteins that are difficult to degrade by PROTACs and provides a unique method for the degradation of novel targets. In summary, ZNRF3/RNF43 is a promising target for degrading PD-L1, which is worthy of a researcher's focus [44][45][46][47].\n**GlueTAC**\nIn 2021, The team of Chen and Lin of Peking University reported a general technology for degrading PD-L1 on the membrane [48]. An unnatural amino acid (PrUAA) is introduced into the binding region of the anti-PD-L1 nanobody (Nb-PD-L1) using a mass spectrometry screening platform (MSSP) to form the modified nanobody (GlueBody), which can covalently bind to PD-L1. To accelerate the speed of endocytosis, the GlueBody conjugates with a cell-penetrating peptide and lysosome-sorting sequence (CPP-LSS) to produce the GlueBody chimera (GlueTAC) (Fig. 3). Covalent binding can avoid the problem of degradation efficiency caused by the dissociation of membrane protein degraders and membrane protein complexes in the process of endocytosis and degradation [48]. Subsequent experimental results show that GlueTAC can quickly mediate endocytosis and improve PD-L1 breakdown in the lysosomes within various cancer cells, such as breast cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, and others (Table 2). Finally, the authors further demonstrate that GlueTAC-mediated PD-L1 degradation can activate T cells and inhibit tumor growth more efficiently and persistently than simply blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction in vivo [48].\n**gPD-L1-ADC**\nIn 2018, Hung's team performed WB and flow cytometry experiments using a recombinant glycosidase (PNGase F) to prove that the connection between PD-L1 and PD-1 relies on the glycosylation of PD-L1 [49]. The researchers selected 50 N-linked glycosyltransferases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and co-immunoprecipitation to find a positive correlation between the activity of B3GNT3 transferase and the glycosylation of PD-L1 in the EGF/EGFR signaling pathway within triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Therefore, B3GNT3 can protect PD-L1 from degradation by triggering PD-L1 glycosylation. The researchers purified the glycosylated PD-L1 (gPD-L1) antibody STM108 with high binding affinity and conjugated it with the anti-mitotic drug monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) to form an antibody-drug conjugate (gPD-L1-ADC) (Fig. 3) [49]. The gPD-L1-ADC can effectively block the connection between PD-1 and PD-L1 and facilitate the internalization and degradation of PD-L1 to improve the immune activity of immune cells (Table 2). Moreover, it can also release residual toxins, triggering a strong side effect in adjacent breast cancer cells. The use of gPD-L1-ADC resulted in a significantly higher rate of regression (70%) on 4T1-hPD-L1 tumors compared to treatment with either MMAE or antibody alone in mice [49].\n**CDTAC**\nIn 2023, Wang and Nie's team developed a novel nanomolecule, carbon-dot -based PROTAC (CDTAC), which can degrade PD-L1 based on carbon-dot [50]. The researchers first synthesized CD with glutathione and then conducted CDTAC, which can selectively bind to PD-L1 and subsequently recruit CRBN. After a complex of CDTAC with PD-L1 forms in tumor tissue, it is moved to lysosomes by endocytosis and broken down to release CDTACs. This lets free CDTAC molecules bind to new PD-L1 proteins and CRBN in the cytoplasm, causing more PD-L1 proteins to be ubiquitinated, marked, and broken down by the proteasomal pathway (Fig. 4B) [50]. CDTACs have demonstrated a notable ability to degrade a considerable portion of PD-L1, with over 99% or 90% reduction observed in CT26 or B16-F10 tumor cells (Table 2), respectively. Fasting-mimicking diets (FMD) can further increase the Table 2 The degradation characteristics of antibodies or peptide PD-L1 degraders. Simultaneously binds PD-L1 and CI-M6PR to form a ternary complex, resulting in the internalization of PD-L1 into lysosomes for degradation.\n[36]\n**PD-LYSO Human colorectal cancer**\nThe degradation rate is greater than 60% within 2.5 h.\nMimic HIP1R can bind PD-L1 to form endosomes and transport PD-L1 to lysosomes for degradation through lysosomal sorting signals.\n[43]\n**AbTAC**\n**Human breast cancer cells**\nAbTAC exhibited strong capability for promoting the degradation of PD-L1, with a DC50 of 3.4 nM and a Dmax of 63% at 24 h in MDA-MB-231 cells.\nThe fully recombinant bispecific antibodies simultaneously connected the transmembrane E3 ligase-RNF43 and PD-L1 on the cell surface to form a complex that was internalized into the cell, and then PD-L1 was degraded by lysosomes.\n[44]\n**GlueTAC**\nLung cancer cells, breast cancer cells, melanoma 100 nM GlueTAC induced the degradation of PD-L1, with 11% remaining in H460 cells for 12 h at 37 \u2022 C.\nPrUAA mediates the covalent attachment of Gluebody to PD-L1, after which CPP induces endocytosis and LSS induces the degradation of the GlueTAC-target protein complex by the lysosome.\n[48]\ngPD-L1-ADC TNBC 2-10 mg/ml of gPD-L1-ADC rapidly degrades PD-L1 in BT549 cells after treatment for 2-4 min.\ngPD-L1-ADC mediates PD-L1 internalization into lysosomes and degradation through the caveolaedependent endocytosis (CDE) pathway.\n[49]\n**CDTAC**\nNo specific cancer CDTACs degraded PD-L1 more than 99% or 90% with DC50 0.29 \u00b1 0.06 and 0.33 \u00b1 0.03 \u03bcM in CT26 or B16-F10 cancer cells under FMD treatment.\nExtracellular CDTAC binds to PD-L1 and endocytoses into lysosomes for degradation; intracellular circulating CDTAC binds to CRBN and PD-L1 for ubiquitination and degradation.\n[50]\nF. Zhang et al.\nactivity of CDTAC. Also, CDTAC can increase the expression of phosphorylated STING and CD8 + T cells in vivo. This shows that CDTAC changes the environment around the tumor to make it less harmful. In conclusion, CDTAC has many benefits, such as the ability to break down membrane proteins, which traditional small-molecule PROTACs cannot do. This gives a new idea of how PROTAC technology could treat tumors [50].\n**PD-L1 small-molecule inhibitors**\nIn 2021, a bifunctional inhibitor of PD-L1-ARB-272572 (9) (Fig. 4A) was developed by Chris B. Moore et al. 9 inhibited the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction with an IC 50 of 400 pM at the protein level and could induce the dimerization of PD-L1 through crystallographic studies [51]. Complete loss of cell surface PD-L1 was observed in CHO-K1 cells within 1 h with the help of flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, which was mainly due to the internalization of the PD-L1 dimer on the cell surface induced by 9 (Fig. 4C). In vivo experiments with humanized PD-1/PD-L1 mice implanted with MC38 cells showed that the reduction of PD-L1 is positively correlated with the anti-tumor effect. The increase in circulatory CD3 + cells and CD4 + T cells validated the mechanism of action of 9 for immunotherapy (Table 3) [51].\nIn 2021, Jiang's team reported a series of oxadiazole-containing PD-L1 inhibitors based on the biphenyl core [52]. At first, they obtained hit 10 (Fig. 4A) which showed a high level of inhibition in the connection between PD-1 and PD-L1 in the virtual screening assay. After docking analysis and structural optimization of 10, they find the most active 11 (Fig. 4A), with inhibitory activity in the nanomolar range against the PD-1/PD-L1 connection. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that 11 exhibits the capability to trigger the dimerization, internalization, and degradation of cell-surface PD-L1 through a lysosome-dependent pathway (Fig. 4C). Even more, 11 showed excellent anticancer vitality in mouse tumor models by oral administration (Table 3) [52]. Afterward, the team designed a new PD-L1 inhibitor 12 (Fig. 4A) based on 11 through the fragment coupling strategy. In addition to having good PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.8 \u00b1 0.7 nM), 12 also shows the ability to internalize and degrade PD-L1 similar to 11 (Fig. 4C) (Table 3) [53].\nIn 2022, preclinical and early clinical research conducted by Incyte revealed that INCB086550 (1) (Fig. 1), the first orally administered small molecule inhibitor of PD-L1, has an IC 50 of 3.1 nM for human PD-L1 and exhibits the ability to induce PD-L1 degradation [11]. The flow cytometry and confocal experimental results show that 1 competitively binds to PD-L1 mAb and rapidly induces PD-L1 dimerization and internalization and transfers to the nucleus (Fig. 4C). Finally, in CD34 + humanized mice and in clinical studies, PD-L1 was degraded in a dose-dependent way after treatment with 1 and it could significantly restore the immune index (Table 3) [11]. In the same year, Yang published a study introducing a collection of innovative biphenyl PD-L1 small molecule inhibitors, including S4-1 (13) (Fig. 4A), which exhibits remarkable binding affinity and inhibitory effects on the PD-L1 protein [54]. It can cause PD-L1 protein dimerization, induce protein internalization and directly reduce the amount of cell surface PD-L1 protein. Through the colocalization test, the authors also found that PD-L1 protein was transferred to the endoplasmic reticulum in large quantities, which indicated that 13 might have the ability to cause the subsequent ERAD of the PD-L1 protein (Fig. 4C). Finally, 13 exhibited significant antitumor activity and improved the tumor microenvironment (Table 3) [54]. The above findings offer a further understanding of the small-molecule inhibitors' capability to induce internalization and degradation of PD-L1, which presents a promising opportunity for the development of PD-L1 small-molecule degraders.\n**Multifunctional PD-L1 degraders**\n**UPS-based degraders 4.1.1. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors**\nMany studies have shown that activation of EGFR leads to an increase in PD-L1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells [55,56]. In 2016, Hung's team found that the immunosuppressive ability of PD-L1 is tightly regulated by N-glycosylation [57]. The glycosylated PD-L1 (gPD-L1, 45-55 KDa) is more stable than the non-glycosylated one (ngPD-L1, 33 KDa) because the latter is more likely to be degraded via E3 enzymes \u03b2-TrCP. Previous reports have shown that the expression of \u03b2-TrCP and PD-L1 is negatively correlated [58]. Hung's experiments, such as immunocoprecipitation, revealed that glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) is responsible for the phosphorylation of PD-L1, followed by binding with \u03b2-TrCP which leads to PD-L1's undergoing poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (Fig. 5B). By investigating the signaling pathway preceding PD-L1, the researchers discovered that the activation of EGFR can cause the inhibition of GSK3\u03b2, resulting in the stabilization of PD-L1 expression. In contrast, treatment of cells or mice with EGFR inhibitors (Gefitinib, 14, Erlotinib, 15, Lapatinib, 16, or AG1478, 17) (Fig. 5A) was found to reduce PD-L1 expression and raise immune responses by promoting tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells [57]. Recently, there has been growing evidence that gPD-L1 is important for PD-L1-mediated tumor immunosuppression and is expected to become a target and biomarker for cancer immunotherapy [59,60]. In 2017, Lu et al. discovered that Osimertinib (18) (Fig. 5A), a third-generation EGFR-TKI, has the potential to decrease PD-L1 levels in EGFR-mutated NSCLC cells. The authors showcased that Osimertinib exhibited the ability to not only inhibit the production of PD-L1 mRNA but also degrade PD-L1 protein at the post-translational level in both NCI-H1975 and HCC827 cells. Osimertinib shortens the lifespan of PD-L1 and triggers the breakdown of PD-L1 through GSK3\u03b2-mediated degradation via the proteasome (Fig. 5B) [61]. In 2021, Sun et al. conducted an in-depth study of Osimertinib-induced PD-L1 degradation and found a different degradation mechanism. In rescue experiments, neither blocking \u03b2-TrCP nor inhibiting GSK3 prevented Osimertinib-induced PD-L1 reduction, whereas an E3 ubiquitin ligase membrane-associated RING-CH8 (MARCH8) did, which was not noticed before. The N-terminal region of MARCH8 interacts with PD-L1, leading to its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fig. 6C). This study establishes a new linker between MARCH8 and PD-L1 modulation [62].\nIn 2021, Xie et al. investigated how the E3 ubiquitin ligase ARIH1 contributes to the elimination of PD-L1 and the enhancement of antitumor immunity [63]. In this study, the authors screened 2125  Triggering PD-L1 dimerization and internalization, then degrading PD-L1 through lysosomes.\n[52]\n**12**\nHuman breast cancer cells 12 (5 \u03bcM) induced significant degradation of PD-L1 degradation in MDA-MB-231 cells and showed good anti-tumor activity in vivo by intraperitoneal administration.\n[53]\n**(S4-1) Lung and colon cancer**\nAfter 6 h of treatment with 1 \u03bcM of 13 in RKO cells, we can see the cytoplasmic increase and the decrease in the cell membrane of the PD-L1 concentration.\n13 inhibits the PD1/PD-L1 axis, increases the entry of PD-L1 into the endoplasmic reticulum, and leads to subsequent ERAD.\n[54]\nF. Zhang et al.\nFDA-approved drugs and found a third-generation EGFR inhibitor, ES-072 (19) (Fig. 5A) [64], which could degrade PD-L1 efficiently. The team observed that 19 induces the degradation of PD-L1 by promoting the phosphorylation of PD-L1 through the endogenous kinase GSK3\u03b1 rather than the previously mentioned GSK3\u03b2-driven mechanism (Fig. 5C) [57]. Then, 19 was found to promote the mutual incorporation of PD-L1 with ARIH1 dose-dependently by mass spectrometry immunoprecipitation, which increases endogenous PD-L1 degradation in H1975 and HEK293T cells. Next, the authors investigated the effect of 19 combined with anti-CTLA4 therapy using a 4T1 tumor xenograft model, which resulted in a further reduction in tumor growth, or even complete regression, with total activated CD8 + cells in the tumor compared to monotherapy. The levels of toxic T cells were also significantly elevated. This is an innovative finding that EGFR inhibitors can promote anti-tumor immunity by degrading PD-L1 through ARIH1 [63].\nIn conclusion, the study demonstrated that EGFR-TKIs have the ability to degrade PD-L1 by affecting transcriptional and posttranslational processes in tumor cells (Table 4). Besides, there is much other evidence showing the inhibition or degradation of PD-L1 by inhibiting EGFR [65]. However, the specific mechanism of each inhibitor is different and needs further research.\n**Metformin**\nIn 2018, Hung's team found that breast cancer patients who took Metformin (20) (Fig. 5A) for a long time had lower levels of PD-L1 expression in their tumor tissues [66]. Extended analysis revealed that abnormal PD-L1 glycosylation occurs when S195 is phosphorylated, which blocks the translocation of PD-L1 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. As a result, the misfolded PD-L1 is degraded through the ERAD pathway. Metformin can directly activate this phosphorylation through the activation of AMPK (Fig. 5D) [66]. The team identified HRD1 as an ERAD E3 ligase in charge of the degradation of PD-L1, and it is possible that HRD1 could be a target available in forthcoming cancer immunotherapy approaches. Despite this, the exact mechanism underlying HRD1's role in this pathway remains incompletely elucidated, leaving room for further exploration of its potential as a therapeutic option [66]. In 2019, Liu et al. confirmed that Metformin inhibited PD-L1 by promoting the direct binding between AMPK protein and PD-L1 protein in endometrial carcinoma [67]. In 2021, Yang et al. created a self-assembling nano-drug (MS NPs) by utilizing hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between Metformin and the anticancer reagent 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38, 21) (Fig. 5A) [68]. After the nano-drug was delivered to the tumor tissue, the chemotherapeutic drug SN38 could directly kill some cancer cells through cytotoxicity and recruit immune cells to infiltrate the tumor tissue. At the same time, Metformin could induce abnormal glycosylation and ERAD of PD-L1 to promote the killing activity of infiltrating immune cells (Fig. 5D) [68]. In in vivo experiments, the tumor growth of the mice in the MS NPs group was significantly inhibited, and the survival time of the mice was significantly prolonged. This study examines the mechanism by which Metformin induces the degradation of PD-L1 within the endoplasmic reticulum, offering fresh perspectives on the advancement of innovative immune checkpoint inhibitors [68].\nIn 2021, Ouyang et al. discovered that the electrostatic membrane association of PD-L1's cytoplasmic domain is damaged by Metformin, which can degrade PD-L1, offering a promising approach to enhance cancer immunotherapy [69]. In this study, the researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance to find that the cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1 (PD-L1-CD) was bonding to the membrane in the presence of acidic phospholipids. During the process, three amino acid residues (R260, R262, and R265) of PD-L1-CD bind to acidic phospholipids on the cell membrane through electrostatic interaction [69]. Moreover, palmitosylation at C272 further reinforces the membrane integration of PD-L1's cytoplasmic domain. Mutations in R260, R262, and R265 enhance the ubiquitination of PD-L1 and accelerate its degradation. Further assays found that Metformin can competitively destroy the electrostatic interaction between PD-L1's cytoplasmic domain and acidic phospholipids, thereby affecting the reaction of PD-L1-CD to cell membranes and reducing the abundance of PD-L1 [69] (Fig. 5E).\nIn summary, the above research results demonstrate a series of new mechanisms by which Metformin degrades PD-L1 on the membrane and intracellular level in different ways (Table 4), which provides new ideas for related immunotherapy against PD-L1. Further research on the degradation mechanism of Metformin on PD-L1 and advancing its clinical application will help to develop more effective cancer immunotherapy methods.\n**BMS-1166**\nBristol-Myers Squibb has made significant advancements in the development of novel small-molecule immune checkpoint inhibitors that damage the connection of PD-L1 and PD-1 based on biphenyl compounds [70,71]. These inhibitors demonstrate a remarkable ability to inhibit the PD-1/PD-L1 protein-protein interaction on the surfaces of cancer cells. Notably, one specific compound is called BMS-1166 (22) (Fig. 5A) has shown exceptional potency with an ultra-low IC 50 value of\n**Table 4**\nThe degradation characteristics of USP-based multifunctional PD-L1 degraders.

ABZ can induce PD-L1 ubiquitination and degradation by reducing the expression of UBQLN4.\n[108]\nF. Zhang et al.\n1.4 nm, as determined through in vitro experiments (Table 4) [72]. In 2020, Yu et al. found that 22 could degrade PD-1 via lysosomes in co-culture experiments. It not only abrogates glycosylation but also obstructs endoplasmic reticulum export to the Golgi of PD-L1 through WB and confocal microscopy analyses. Thereby, the accumulation of PD-L1 in the endoplasmic reticulum triggers ERAD and neutralizing its function on the surfaces of cancer cells (Table 4) (Fig. 5D) [73].\n**Carbohydrates**\nThere have been studies indicating that the upregulation of PD-L1 levels in TNBC cells can be achieved through the inactivation of GSK3\u03b2 by PARP inhibitors [74]. To solve this problem, scientists have used PARP inhibitors that incorporate PD-L1 antibodies or synthetic PARP/PD-L1 bifunctional inhibitors to reduce PD-L1 [75,76]. Nevertheless, the special mechanism has not been fully clarified. In 2018, Hung's team found that 2-deoxyglucose (23) (Fig. 5A) could reverse PARP inhibitor-induced immunosuppression in TNBC by deglycosylation of PD-L1. They conducted experiments using WB and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and found that 23 deglycosylated PARPi-induced PD-L1 protein and attenuated its translocation and stability in TNBC, which aggregates PD-L1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 5D) [77]. However, the limited cancer cell-killing ability of 23 and the toxicity at high doses limits the use of this method. In 2020, Lim et al. combined the glycolysis inhibitor 23 with the sensitizer Gefitinib to inhibit glycosylation of PD-L1 and achieve an excellent effect in TNBC. Drawing on previous experience that combined antibody therapy can enhance 4-1BB-mediated anti-tumor effects [78], they combined the 4-1BB antibody with 23/Gefitinib synergy to further improve the efficacy of anti-tumor immunity in a TNBC mouse tumor model and achieved good results [79].\nIn 2022, Lv's team found that D-mannose (24) (Fig. 5A) at the mM level could degrade the PD-L1 protein in TNBC cells by screening the effects of various hexoses on tumor immunity [80]. 24 has the ability to activate AMPK and facilitate phosphorylation of the PD-L1 protein's S195 site in mechanistic studies. This process led to reduced glycosylation of PD-L1 protein and increased subsequent proteasomal degradation (Fig. 5D). Also, the results further inhibit the DNA damage repair process, which can promote the radiotherapy of tumor cells. 24 can achieve a good therapeutic effect when combined with PD-1 antibodies or radiotherapy, which significantly prolonged the survival of a mouse model of TNBC and obviously inhibited tumor growth [80].\nIn 2023, Huang's team designed a series of glycoside molecules utilizing the foundational structure of BMS inhibitors [81]. Given that carbohydrate recognition receptors such as mannose receptor (MR) are crucial in promoting the immune response by enabling effective communication and collaboration between various immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells [82,83]. A variety of saccharide derivatives were incorporated into the tail of BMS-202 (25) (Fig. 5A), another biphenyl molecule [84], resulting in the synthesis of a series of bifunctional glycoside compounds. In this work, they found that inhibitors C15 (26) (Fig. 5A) exhibited significant PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, aroused T cells, and had anti-tumor effects in vivo, and their toxicity, permeability, and solubility were significantly improved compared to BMS molecules [81]. Further research found that 26 also has the ability to decrease PD-L1 at low and high concentrations (1 and 10 \u03bcM) and reduce PD-L1 glycosylation and membrane activity. Proteomic studies of tumor tissue samples found that many trafficking proteins related to the endoplasmic reticulum were reduced, suggesting that 26 induces ERAD of PD-L1 through deglycosylation (Fig. 5D) [81]. Therefore, carbohydrates can regulate the PD1/PD-L1 pathway by reacting with immune cell sugar recognition receptors (Table 4), thereby improving the anti-tumor response, which provides a promising idea for advancing the level of immunotherapy.\n**2, 5-dimethyl-celecoxib**\nHepatitis B virus X (HBx) has the ability to enhance the production of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) by activating the transcription factor EGR1. This consequently leads to an elevated release of prostaglandin, which can have significant implications for the immune microenvironment [85]. Previous studies have shown that 2, 5-dimethyl celecoxib (DMC, 27) (Fig. 6A) may control the development of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [86]. Nevertheless, the relationship between the immune microenvironment and HBV-related HCC caused by HBx is still unclear. In 2020, Tang et al. found that DMC may promote HBx-triggered PD-L1 ubiquitin degradation and significantly inhibit tumor growth in HCC cells overexpressing HBx [87]. They found that HBx in HBV-positive HCC patients was negatively correlated with CD8 in the tumor microenvironment but positively correlated with PD-L1, CD163, and other factors. Through microarray and WB experiments, it was found that DMC enhanced AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation and binding to the PD-L1 protein, causing PD-L1 accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum. The authors found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase RBX1 can ubiquitinate and degrade PD-L1 by protein analysis using IP-MS and si-RNA technology [87] (Fig. 6B). At last, DMC and Atezolizumab and their combination showed good ability in both suppressing tumor growth and decreasing the overall level of immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment. The study on DMC offers a valuable strategic reference for addressing immunosuppression or combined immunity treatment in HBV-related cases, despite its inability to directly interact with RBX1 and degrade PD-L1 (Table 4) [87].\n**STUB1 modulators**\nIn 2021, Wang et al. selected three non-phosphorylated vitamin B6-Pyridoxal (28), Pyridoxine (29), and Pyridoxamine (30) (Fig. 6A) to check the impact on PD-L1 expression level and found that 28 can effectively lower the concentration of PD-L1 in pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, and colon cancer [88]. The qRT-PCR analysis and rescue experiment demonstrated that 28 promotes PD-L1 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. By knocking out the reported E3 ligase associated with PD-L1, the co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay showed STIP1 homology, and U-box containing protein 1 (STUB1) is the E3 ligase promoting PD-L1 degradation upon 28 treatment (Table 4). Although the further mechanism of 28 boost PD-L1 degradation hasn't been clearly explained; targeting STUB1 with Vitamin B6 to enhance the responsiveness of tumor cells to T cells has the potential to be an option for combination immunotherapy (Fig. 6C) [88].\n**CDK5 inhibitors**\nIn 2021, George R. Stark et al. identified Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) and ubiquitin E3 ligase FBXO22 as the regulators of drug resistance using the validation-based insertional mutagenesis (VBIM) method and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) [89]. They found that CDK5 could increase the PD-L1 amount in NSCLC cells, and inhibition of CDK5 with Roscovitine (31) (Fig. 6A) could increase FBXO22 levels. Further research found that high expression of FBXO22 and phosphorylation of FBXO22 at S160 or S162 could advance the degradation of PD-L1 (Fig. 6C). Therefore, combining Roscovitine with immune checkpoint inhibitors may enhance the vitality of DNA-damaging therapies [89]. Similarly, Lu et al. also found that knocking out CDK5 can degrade PD-L1 through TRIM21 ubiquitinase, and the CDK5 inhibitor Dinaciclib (32) (Fig. 6A) can significantly degrade PD-L1 at the protein level [90]. Therefore, CDK5 inhibitors will be a promising PD-L1 degrader and provide an option for immunotherapy (Table 4).\n**SGLT2 inhibitors**\nIn 2023, Yang et al. studied the effect of 98 clinical molecules on PD-L1 and found that the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor Canagliflozin (33) (Fig. 6A) perfectly reduced the expression of PD-L1 not only in several kinds of NSCLC cell lines but also in H292 xenograft mice [91]. Knockout experiments exhibited that the reduction of PD-L1 initiated by Canagliflozin was a targeted effect by destroying the roles of SGLT2 and PD-L1 on the cell surface. In endocytosis-related experiments, it was found that Canagliflozin restrains the endocytic recycling of PD-L1. In subsequent studies, it was discovered that Canagliflozin facilitated the degradation of PD-L1 via SPOP ubiquitination (Fig. 6C) [91]. Moreover, SGLT2 was found to have a competitive effect on the communication control between PD-L1 and SPOP. Canagliflozin, alone or in combination with CTLA4 blockade, inhibits tumor growth in PBMC and CD34 + stem cells in humanized xenograft models. Evaluated the amount of SGLT2 and PD-L1 in 100 lung cancer patients and found that SGLT2 and PD-L1 were positively correlated [91]. Therefore, Canagliflozin has an extremely high application value in treating NSCLC (Table 4). In addition, the inhibitory effect on PD-L1 expression was also observed with other SGLT2 inhibitors such as LX-4211 (34) and Dapagliflozin (35) (Fig. 6A), but the effect was not as good as Canagliflozin [91].\n**CSN5 inhibitors**\nIn the tumor microenvironment, macrophages are a highly prevalent type of immune cell known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [92]. In 2016, Hung and colleagues showed that inflammation induces TAMs secretion of TNF\u03b1 and activation of NF\u03baB, which augments deubiquitinase COP9 signalosome 5 (CSN5) gene transcription and production in cancer cells [93]. CSN5 decreases PD-L1 ubiquitination and increases its stability. The activity of CSN5-associated kinase can be inhibited by Curcumin (36) (Fig. 6A), a natural dietary supplement [94]. In this study, the authors demonstrated that 36 destabilizes PD-L1 by inhibiting the deubiquitination activity of CSN5 and sensitizes cancer cells to anti-CTLA4 antibodies, thereby facilitating anti-CTLA4 therapy [93]. In 2019, Du's team reported that TAM-secreted C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) leads to CSN5's upregulation through the p65/STAT3 pathway and promotes the immune escape of human colorectal cancer cells [95]. This is because increased expression of CSN5 results in more stable PD-L1. 37 (Fig. 6A) is an inhibitor of CSN5 and binds to CSN5 with low energy (13.4 kcal/mol). CETSA experiments have confirmed the specific interaction between CSN5 and 37. In seven different colorectal cancer cell lines, 37 was found to suppress the expression of CSN5 and the synthesis of the PD-L1 protein, and in AOM/LPS mice, 37 obviously suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the cytotoxic activity of T cells [95]. In 2020, Deng et al. found that the anti-inflammatory drug Berberine (38) (Fig. 6A) can serve as a negative moderator of PD-L1 [96]. The pull-down and SPR assays demonstrated that 38 interacts with CSN5, and it was demonstrated that 38 suppressed the deubiquitination activity of CSN5 in vitro. 38 restores NSCLC cell sensitivity to T-cell cytotoxicity in vitro and limits tumor growth in Lewis tumor-bearing mice. The team revealed a new antitumor mechanism of 38 that was not known previously, indicating that 38 has the potential to be used as a small-molecule inhibitor to disrupt the immunosuppressive effects of PD-L1 [96]. In 2021, a study conducted by Su revealed that the degradation of PD-L1 can be effectively triggered by Shikonin (39) (Fig. 6A), which inhibits the activation of both the NF-\u03baB/STAT3 and NF-\u03baB/CSN5 signaling pathways. This result proves that 39 can be used as an immunotherapeutic agent and deserves further study [97]. In 2023, Hu found that Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 40) (Fig. 6A) could decrease PD-L1 expression in different types of cancer cells [98]. After ruling out that DHA affects PD-L1 in gene transcription and glycosylation, they found that PD-L1 is degraded by DHA through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. DHA can not only inhibit CSN5 but also inhibit the palmitoylation of PD-L1 via reducing fatty acid synthase and the downstream palmitoyltransferase DHHC5, thereby controlling the expression of PD-L1. Finally, DHA enabled T-cell activation in vitro and inhibited LLC xenograft growth in vivo [98].\nOverall, CSN5 inhibitors are a valuable PD-L1 degrader based on the above results (Fig. 6C) (Table 4). Although there are still relatively few studies on inhibiting CSN5 from degrading PD-L1, further experimental and clinical studies are needed to verify its efficacy and side effects. In addition, an in-depth understanding of the role of CSN5 in other cellular signaling pathways is needed to fully evaluate its potential as a therapeutic target. However, inhibiting CSN5 to degrade PD-L1 is a promising research direction that may provide new strategies and opportunities for the development of immunotherapy.\n**USP7 inhibitors**\nThe role of USP7 as a deubiquitinating enzyme in tumors has drawn increasing attention, and many small molecules targeting USP7 have been developed [99][100][101][102]. Various tumor environments can be improved by inhibiting USP7, which is a very potent cancer therapeutic target [103]. In 2020, Liu's team found that USP7 and PD-L1 were positively associated with gastric cancer samples [104]. Direct interaction between USP7 and PD-L1 results in the promotion of PD-L1 deubiquitination and stabilization. Inhibition of USP7 or downregulation of its expression reduces the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1, ultimately leading to sensitization of cancer cells to T cell toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Almac 4 (41) (Fig. 6A) is a powerful and selective allosteric USP7 inhibitor [101]. The authors found that PD-L1 expression decreased in a time-dependent manner in gastric cancer cells treated with 41. 41 can induce cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and inhibit the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by stabilizing P53 [104]. Similarly, in 2023, Xiao et al. developed a peptide called CPP-A11 (42) by combining the Annexin A1 (ANXA1)-derived peptide A11 (EYVQTVKSSKG) with a cell-penetrating peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR, CPP) [105][106][107]. 42 competitively binds to USP7 and degrades PD-L1, thus inhibiting tumor immune escape and exerting a broad-spectrum anti-tumor effect, which has an important clinical transformation value [107]. Therefore, inhibiting USP7 is a promising approach to degrading PD-L1 and enhancing the sensitivity of tumor cells to immunotherapy (Fig. 6C) (Table 4). However, further studies are currently needed to fully understand the potential efficacy and side effects of inhibiting USP7 for cancer therapy.\n**Albendazole**\nIn 2021, Liu et al. screened the anti-tumor immunity of common clinical drugs containing imidazole structures and found that Albendazole (ABZ, 43) (Fig. 6A), a low-toxicity antiparasitic drug with broadspectrum activity, has the potential to regulate the immune microenvironment of tumors and significantly decrease the expression amount of PD-L1 in tumor membranes [108]. In immune-competent mouse models of melanoma and lung cancer, ABZ exhibited notable potential for suppressing tumor growth and increasing the concentration and vitality of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells. By inhibiting the proteasome, it was found that ABZ-induced degradation of PD-L1 was mediated by ubiquitin. In further mechanism studies, the team used a series of molecular biological methods such as immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry and CRISPR to clarify that Ubiquilin 4 (UBQLN4), which belongs to the ubiquilin family [109], interacts with PD-L1 and stabilizes the protein level of PD-L1, while ABZ promotes ubiquitin-mediated PD-L1 degradation by downregulating UBQLN4 (Table 4) [108]. Through bioinformatics analysis, it was found that ABZ can synergistically enhance the antitumor effect of CD73 gene deletion or CD73-specific inhibitor (APCP) in the melanoma mouse model. In summary, this study provides a predictive target for evaluating clinical immunotherapy efficacy (UBQLN4/PD-L1) and a new strategy for tumor-combined immunotherapy [108].\n**Lysosome-based degraders 4.2.1. Palmitoylation inhibitor**\nPalmitoylation is a reversible modification of protein lipids, in which S-type palmitoylation is a covalent modification of a 16-carbon palmitoyl group to the sulfhydryl group of protein cysteine through a thioester bond. It can regulate the processes of protein transport, stability, and cell membrane binding. Palmitoylation is catalyzed by a class of palmitoyl acyltransferases containing Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) in the active center, so it is also called the DHHC family, which has more than 20 members in mammals [110]. In 2019, Xu's group explored the influence of palmitoylation modification on PD-L1 and found that a general palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitic acid (44) (Fig. 7), could markedly reduce the palmitoylation and amount of PD-L1 in RKO cells, a type of human colorectal cancer (CRC) [111]. The authors used the CSS-palm model to predict the modification site of PD-L1. They used site-directed mutagenesis combined with click chemistry to verify the existence of palmitoylation at the C272 amino acid site in the intracellular region of PD-L1. By different biochemical and cellular molecular biology experiments, the researchers found that palmitoylation effectively prevented the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of PD-L1 in cancer cells, thus inhibiting the killing effect of T cells on tumors. Inhibiting the palmitoylation of PD-L1 can enhance its binding to endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT). This can Fig. 7. The chemical structure of 44 and its mechanism to inhibit palmitoylation and promote degradation.\n**Table 5**\nThe degradation characteristics of lysosome-based multifunctional PD-L1 degraders. 45 can activate the MITF translocation to the nucleus through the PKC\u03b1-GSK3\u03b2 pathway and mediate the degradation of PD-L1 in the lysosome to exert its anti-tumor activity.\n[114]\n**46**\n**NSCLC cells**\nThe degradation rate of PD-L1 reaches 70% with 46 (20 \u03bcM) for 48 h.\nProteasome-dependent pathway.\n[115]\n**47**\n**Human breast cancer cells**\nThe inhibitory rate of PD-L1 was 47% when cocultured with MDA-MB-231 cells at a 20 \u03bcM concentration for 24 h.\nLysosome-dependent pathway.\n[\nNo specific cancer H460, H157, A375, and A2058 cells treated with 5 \u03bcM of TBM-1 for 24 h could significantly reduce the PD-L1 level.\nTBM-1 promotes the TFEB nuclear translocation-dependent lysosomal pathway.\n[117]\n**(Amlodipine)**\nNo specific cancer RKO cells and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 10-20 \u03bcM of Amlodipine for 0-24 h could significantly reduce the PD-L1 level.\nAmlodipine suppressed calpain binding to Beclin-1 and induced the autophagy of PD-L1 in the recycling endosome.\n[118]\n**52**\n(Lercanidipine)\n**Primary lung cancer**\nThe expression of PD-L1 protein induced by IFN\u03b3 (10 ng/ml) was significantly reduced by treatment with Lercanidipine (2.5, 5, 10 \u03bcM) for 24 h in different primary lung cancer cells.\nLercanidipine decreases the expression of PD-L1 by suppressing calcium-dependent signaling pathways.\n[120]\n**53**\nHuman lung cancer cells 53 showed 66.99% PD-L1 degradation at 20 \u03bcM for 24 h.\nLysosome-dependent pathway.\n[121]\n**(Erianin)**\nNo specific cancer PD-L1 expression is remarkably reduced in various cancer cells treated with 10-100 \u03bcM 54 for 12 h.\nLysosome-dependent pathway.

Zhang et al. lead to PD-L1 in tumor cells being readily transported to multivesicular bodies (MVB) for lysosomal degradation (Fig. 7) [111]. By analyzing and validating the expression of all DHHC members in tumors and knocking down multiple DHHCs; the authors discovered that DHHC3 palmitoyltransferase plays a pivotal function in the regulation of PD-L1 palmitoylation in cancer cells. Co-localized and tissue microarray staining showed that the expression of DHHC3 was directly proportional to PD-L1 in different kinds of tumor cells. Interfering with DHHC3 expression in mouse MC38 cells led to a notable reduction in PD-L1 protein and effectively suppressed the growth of MC38 cell colonies in C57 mice. The injection of 44 in MC38 tumor-bearing mice at a dosage of 40 mg/kg resulted in powerful inhibition of PD-L1 expression, tumor growth, and an increase in the infiltration of CD8 + cells in the tumor tissue (Table 5) [111]. These results validate the hypothesis that palmitoylation inhibitors activate antitumor immune cell activity in vivo by reducing PD-L1 expression. In addition, the authors designed a competitive inhibitor, PD-PALM, based on the polypeptide sequence near the modified site of PD-L1 by DHHC3, which can better reduce the abundance of PD-L1 in tumor cells than 44 [111]. Coincidentally, Hung's group also reported similar conclusions in the same year, but they discovered that the palmitoylation modification of PD-L1 in breast cancer cells was mainly carried out by ZDHHC9 [112]. Li et al. also found that knocking out ZDHHC9 in lung adenocarcinoma can inhibit PD-L1 palmitoylation and reduce its stability [113]. But in general, degrading PD-L1 by small-molecule inhibition of PD-L1 palmitoylation provides a unique alternative way to improve the efficacy of  anti-PD-L1/PD-1 therapy.\n**Aloperine derivatives**\nA novel small molecule called SA-49 (45) (Fig. 8), based on Aloperine, was discovered by Song et al., in 2019 [114]. 45 activates protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1) and then restrains GSK3\u03b2 activity to trigger microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) translocation to the nuclear. It can induce MITF-dependent lysosomal biogenesis and promote the degradation of PD-L1 in the lysosome (Fig. 9A). Furthermore, 45 significantly improved the killing ability of T cells and NK cells, displayed favorable effects in a mouse model implanted with Lewis tumors, and showed good security [114]. In 2021, this team conducted a cognitive study of Aloperine derivatives. After systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis and structural modifications, they synthesized and obtained 29 new 12N-substituted Aloperine derivatives. Among these compounds, 46 (Fig. 8), known for its high activity as a PD-L1 downregulation, indicated successful degradation of both inherent and inducible PD-L1. However, the difference is that 46 induces the degradation of PD-L1 via the proteasome-dependent pathway instead of the lysosome-dependent pathway [115]. In 2022, they synthesized 28 new 12N-substituted Aloperine derivatives, and the activities of degrading PD-L1 were evaluated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Among these compounds, 47 (Fig. 8) has the highest activity and degrades PD-L1 through a lysosomal pathway [116]. The wealth of information obtained from these findings regarding Aloperine derivatives and their potential for cancer immunotherapy makes them highly deserving of further investigation (Table 5).\n**Tubeimoside-1**\nIn 2021, Deng et al. found Tubeimoside-1 (TBM-1, 48) (Fig. 8) could effectively reduce PD-L1 levels in human lung cancer cells with low cytotoxicity among hundreds of natural compounds [117]. They revealed that TBM-1 could prevent the reaction of PD-L1 and PD-1 and activate the toxicity of T cells to cancer cells by cell impedance assays and immune co-culture experiments on NSCLC and human malignant melanoma cells. TBM-1 mediates PD-L1 degradation through a lysosomal pathway that is independent of autophagosomes (Table 5) [117]. They used small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing and immunoblotting to establish that TBM-1 can inhibit mTORC1's activity by directly binding to mTOR and suppressing downstream substrate TFEB phosphorylation. Further investigations have revealed that the nuclear translocation of TFEB, rather than TFE3 or MITF, initiates the process of lysosome biogenesis and PD-L1 degradation (Fig. 9B). In in vivo experiments, the combined use of TBM-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies can strengthen the effect of reducing the volume of LLC tumors and B16 melanoma xenografts in mice compared to the use of TBM-1 or CTLA-4 antibodies alone, which points out the direction for the practical application of TBM-1 [117].\n**Calcium channel blockers**\nIn 2020, Xu's team found that Amlodipine (49) (Fig. 8), through a drug repurposing screening approach, has the potential to act as an inhibitor of PD-L1, enhancing the effectiveness of PD-L1-based immunotherapy [118]. PD-L1 was gradually decreased by Amlodipine treatment in RKO and MDA-MB-231 cells. Rescue experiments found that lysosomal and autophagy inhibitors could weaken the Amlodipine-induced reduction of PD-L1, but the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not affect cancer cells. By the way, the expression of autophagy markers, LC3-II, increased, and p62 decreased in the Amlodipine experimental group. These results indicate that Amlodipine induces autophagy of PD-L1 [118]. To discover the relationship between Amlodipine and autophagy, the authors conducted WB and immunofluorescence assays, which revealed that inhibiting or eliminating calpain by calpeptin or siRNAs could decrease the abundance of PD-L1 and p62 and increase LC3-II [118]. There is evidence that calpain can induce the cleavage of the autophagy-related protein Beclin-1 and inhibit the occurrence of autophagy [119]. Here, Amlodipine induces autophagy by blocking calcium influx and reducing calpain-induced cleavage of Beclin-1. Further research found that this autophagy is highly selective for recycling endosomes and degrades the PD-L1 protein enriched in circulating endosomes (Fig. 9C) [118]. In the MC38 tumor-bearing mouse model, Amlodipine inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner and promoted the infiltration of CD8 + cells in tumor tissues. It is worth noting that the calcium chelator BAPTA (50) (Fig. 8), as well as the other calcium channel blocker Nifedipine (51) (Fig. 8), were both able to inhibit PD-L1 expression by intracellular calcium assay. In contrast, SERCA inhibitors 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) and the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ ATPase blocker drug thapsigargin could increase PD-L1 expression by increasing cytoplasmic calcium concentrations. In summary, these studies reveals a possible role for Amlodipine in blocking PD-L1 expression via a calcium-dependent pathway, which provides a new therapeutic strategy for immunotherapy [118]. In 2021, Ding established that the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker Lercanidipine (52) (Fig. 8) has a different mechanism than autophagy [120]. They found that Lercanidipine could suppress PD-L1 transcription by inhibiting calcium influx in NSCLC. Decreased cytosolic calcium levels inhibit downstream calmodulin kinase (CAMKII) signaling and phosphorylation of STAT1 (the transcription factor of PD-L1), resulting in reduced PD-L1 transcription and expression [120]. In 2022, they modified the structure of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and discovered compound 53 (Fig. 8), which not only greatly attenuated the side effects caused by the calcium channel blockade but also improved the ability to degrade PD-L1 [121]. Further studies found that 53 degraded PD-L1 via lysosomes in a doseand time-dependent manner, and 53 showed good bioavailability and T cell-mediated tumor cell killing in mice [121]. This part provides a new direction for dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in immunotherapy (Table 5).\n**Erianin**\nErianin (54) (Fig. 10A) is a natural bibenzyl compound extracted from Dendrobium. Studies have shown that 54 has strong anti-colon cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer effects [122]. In 2021, Jin et al. studied the anti-tumor mechanism of 54 [123]. In WB and RT-PCR experiments of HCT-116 and other cells, the decreased expression of PD-L1 mRNA and protein indicated that 54 could restrain the synthesis of PD-L1 and increase PD-L1 degradation. Further lysosome inhibition and LysoTracker Red staining experiments in HeLa cells confirmed that PD-L1 degradation was mainly due to lysosome-mediated degradation rather than proteasome degradation [123]. At the gene level, 54 reduces the incorporation between HIF-1\u03b1 and RAS through the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 and RAS/Raf/MEK/MAPK-ERK pathways, further leading to a reduction in PD-L1 concentration (Fig. 9D). In the co-culture system of T cells and HeLa cells and the mouse model of cervical cancer, 54 could significantly inhibit tumor growth and restore the cytotoxicity of T cells to kill tumor cells (Table 5) [123].\n**Sunitinib**\nIn 2021, Chen et al. found that Sunitinib (55) (Fig. 10A), a multitarget receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, plays a crucial role in tumor immune regulation [124]. Using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), they discovered that the great majority of sunitinib targets were significantly positively associated with PD-L1 across multiple cancer types. When treating melanoma-bearing immunized mice with Sunitinib, the tumor-inhibiting effect is obvious, and the immune activity of CTL is greatly enhanced. Sunitinib-treated A375 cells' RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) found a large number of autophagy-related genes were expressed. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopic analysis found that the expression of PD-L1 on the cell membrane surface was reduced, and the expression of PD-L1-p62 and PD-L1-LC3/LAMP1 colocalization increased in the cytoplasm [124]. Sunitinib mediates p62 binding to PD-L1 and transfer to autolysosomes for degradation (Fig. 10B). In summary, the mechanism by which Sunitinib regulates the immune activity of tumor cells is the selective autophagic degradation mediated by p62 (Table 5). At last, the combined use of Sunitinib and CTLA4 mAbs can greatly improve the therapeutic effect in melanoma and NSCLC patients [124].\n**ITCH activator**\nMAPK-targeted therapy is an effective treatment for melanoma, but the overexpression of PD-L1/L2 on the cancer cell membrane during treatment is one of the important reasons for tumor cells to develop treatment resistance [125]. In May 2022, Roger S. Lo's team found that the E3 ligase ITCH can ubiquitinate and degrade cancer surface PD-L1/L2 in engineered M229 R5, a MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi)-induced human melanoma cells, thereby enhancing T cell activation [126]. The study found that ITCH can interact with and regulate PD-L1 in various tumor cells through co-immunoprecipitation and proximity labeling technology combined with mass spectrometry analysis. ITCH downregulates PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell membrane by internalizing and ubiquitinating PD-L1 to increase the lysosomal degradation of PD-L1 [126]. In vitro co-culture experiments with T cells demonstrated that the level of ITCH expression in cancer cells can affect the expression of PD-L1 to regulate T cell activity. Cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and single-cell RNA-sequencing combined with single-cell TCR sequencing (scRNA-seq/scTCR-seq) in a murine melanoma model with MAPKi therapy showed that loss of ITCH expression in tumor cells can lead to overexpression of PD-L1, decreased infiltration of CD8 + T cells in tumors, and increased Tregs and M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (M2-like TAMs), thereby promoting tumor escape from immunosuppression and development of drug resistance. In contrast, high expression of ITCH can inhibit the upregulation of PD-L1 and maintain the proliferation and vitality of CD8 + effector T cells in the tumor. In mouse models of melanoma, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer caused by a variety of different genotypes, the resistance to MAPKi-targeted therapy can be strongly inhibited to enhance the therapeutic effect [126]. Based on the above findings, the authors propose that activation of ITCH activity could be combined with MAPKi-targeted therapy to treat cancer. According to screening the small molecule of ITCH in in vitro activity experiments, the authors found that the activator compound AK087 (56) (Fig. 10A) can enhance the activity of ITCH, promote ubiquitination, and reduce the expression of PD-L1 in tumor cells (Table 5). In a variety of melanoma MAPK-targeted therapy mouse models, the combination of 56 and MAPKi can inhibit the development of resistance and greatly enhance the therapeutic effect. Therefore, such PD-L1-degrading therapies may have broad applications in the field of MAPKi-resistant tumors [126].\n**Sigma1 modulators**\nFelix J. Kim et al. found that Sigma1 is an integral membrane scaffolding protein highly expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum of a series of cancer cells that controls the homeostasis of cellular proteins and lipids [127,128]. In 2017, they leveraged the principle that Sigma1 can stabilize PD-L1 through glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum and found that Sigma1 modulators 1-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(2-adamantyl) guanidine (IPAG, 57) (Fig. 10A) are capable of inducing selective autophagy in cancer cells, leading to the degradation of PD-L1 [129]. They discovered that using RNAi to knock down Sigma1 or 57 could inhibit Sigma1 in TNBC cells and PC cells that were able to suppress the IFN\u03b3-induced PD-L1. The results of this study revealed that 57 could eliminate PD-L1 and prevent PD-L1 expression at the cell membrane by selective autophagy instead of bulk macroautophagy, or ERAD (Table 5). Thus, Sigma1 modulators have the potential to serve as innovative drugs that regulate the tumor immune microenvironment and are helpful for PD-L1/PD-1 targeted therapy patients [129].\n**A novel Platinum (IV) prodrug CJ2**\nIn order to solve the problems of traditional divalent Platinum chemotherapy drugs due to their low selectivity and large side effects, Wei et al. developed a series of new Platinum (IV) prodrugs in 2023 [130]. The BRD4 inhibitor JQ-1 was introduced into the axial ligand of Platinum (IV) as a functional group. Among them, CJ2 (58) (Fig. 10A) demonstrated the highest efficacy in terms of therapeutic activity and showed lower levels of toxicity. 58 can simultaneously down-regulate the cell membrane and cytoplasm PD-L1 and reverses immunosuppression and improves Platinum resistance caused by DNA damage repair. They clarified that 58 not only has the characteristics that JQ-1 can inhibit the synthesis of PD-L1 at the transcriptional level [131], but also can reduce PD-L1 by accelerating degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway (Table 5). 58 can stimulate immune activity and promote the infiltration of CD8 + T cells. This reminds us that a combination of chemotherapy and PD-L1-degrading drugs can significantly prevent tumor growth by deregulating the immunosuppressive microenvironment and enhancing DNA damage [130].\n**PPAR\u03b3 modulators**\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression. PPAR\u03b3 is involved in a variety of physiological processes, including adipocyte differentiation, glucose metabolism, and inflammation. It is also the target of several drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes and related metabolic disorders. It mainly includes three subtypes of PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4, and PPAR\u03b3. Among them, the PPAR\u03b3 subtype has attracted the most attention from scholars, and PPAR\u03b3 plays a crucial role in regulating cellular metabolism, inflammation, immunity, and cancer progression [132]. In 2023, Hou's team found that the expression of PPAR\u03b3 can promote the activation of T cells in NSCLC to relieve immunosuppression, which is related to the decrease in PD-L1 protein level through clinical analysis [133]. Further analysis revealed that PPAR\u03b3 contains the LC3 interacting region motif, which can associate with LC3 in autophagosomes, leading to the degradation of PD-L1 in lysosomes [133]. They found that the PPAR\u03b3 agonist Pioglitazone (59) (Fig. 10A) could induce autophagic degradation of PD-L1 in a PPAR\u03b3-dependent manner without affecting its gene expression (Table 5) [134]. By immunofluorescence analysis, Pioglitazone promoted the binding of PD-L1 to PPAR\u03b3 and its translocation to lysosomes. In addition, combined Pioglitazone and PD-1 antibodies increase CD8 + T cells and enhance colorectal tumor immunotherapy [134]. However, current research on the relationship between PPAR\u03b3 and PD-L1 has many contradictory views, such as PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662 (60) (Fig. 10A) inhibits adipogenesis, which can reduce the expression of PD-L1 [135], or that thiazolidinedione agonists increase the expression of PD-L1 in MSS + colorectal cancer cells [136]. Regardless of the inhibition or activation of PPAR\u03b3, all studies point to the positive significance of this target for the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies on immunity [134][135][136][137]. The reasons for the conflicting conclusions may be attributed to differences in cell types, different drug selections between PPAR subtypes, ambiguous properties of drugs between antagonists and agonists, or even the paradoxical role of PPAR\u03b3 in cancer progression [133]. Further research is required to fully understand the involvement of PPAR\u03b3 in immune function.\n**Rigosertib**\nIn 2023, Xiao et al. observed in experiments that Rigosertib (61) (Fig. 10A) can effectively reshape the tumor immune microenvironment, and its anti-tumor effect on BALB/c mice with normal immune function is significantly better than that on nude mice [138]. Decreased PD-L1 was observed in Rigosertib-treated colon cancer tumors and cells in a time-and concentration-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. Both the lysosomal inhibition assay and immunofluorescence proved the degradation of PD-L1 via the lysosomal pathway. Transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescence staining observed the appearance of autophagic vacuoles and LC3-II during Rigosertib-induced autophagic degradation of PD-L1 (Table 5) [138]. Mechanistically, the AMP-activated protein kinase UNC-51-like kinase 1 (AMPK-ULK1) axis plays a key role in Rigosertib-induced autophagy (Fig. 10C). Further research found that the combination of Rigosertib and CTLA-4 blockade effectively suppressed tumor growth in the CRC isograft model. Altogether, Rigosertib is expected to become a PD-L1 degradation drug for immunotherapy of colorectal cancer [138].\n**Summary and Outlook**\nPD-L1 is a key immunoregulatory protein that is expressed on the surface of many tumor cells and can suppress the immune system's response by connecting to PD-1 on T cells, thereby helping tumor cells escape immune surveillance. Degrading PD-L1 has become a research hotspot in the treatment of tumors. More and more evidence has shown that inhibiting PD-L1 expression or improving PD-L1 protein degradation can effectively promote cancer immunotherapy [139][140][141]. In addition to the methods mentioned in the article to degrade PD-L1 during PTM, many other methods of degrading or reducing PD-L1 have not been mentioned in this article due to space limitations. For example, 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON, GFAT1 inhibitors) can inhibit glycosylation and degrade PD-L1 [142]. Sulforaphane can not only inhibit the expression of PD-1 in CAR-T cells but also increase \u03b2-TrCP, thereby inducing the ubiquitination and degradation of PD-L1 [143]. There are also a large number of protein kinases and DNA regulators (such as STAT3 [17], AKT [18], mTOR [58], BET [131], NF\u03baB [144,145], NR4A1 [146], ISG15 [147]) that can reduce expression or degrade PD-L1 by affecting downstream pathways.\nAlthough this article summarizes the benefits of degrading PD-L1 in tumors, many difficulties and challenges exist in studying PD-L1 degraders. Since most drugs do not specifically target PD-L1 and need to reach a higher concentration to achieve a better degradation effect, this is likely to cause toxic effects and side effects targeting other targets. It is meaningful to study drugs that specifically degrade PD-L1. In addition, many studies still need to define the mechanism of PD-L1 degradation. For example, Osimertinib [61,62] and Metformin [66,69] exert degradation effects through multiple pathways; determining their correlation is a topic worthy of study. The relationship between the specific mechanism of certain drugs in reducing PD-L1 and the signaling pathway is not certain, and there are even large differences in related studies. Although many PROTAC methods for degrading proteins have been reported in terms of drug design, it is still difficult to develop small degrading molecules for the PD-L1 protein on the membrane. At present, the development of new antibody or peptide degraders such as LYTAC [36], AbTAC [44], GlueTAC [48], PD-LYSO [43], and gPD-L1-ADC [49] and the change in pharmaceutical preparations such as CDTAC [50], polymer [148,149], self-assembling peptides [150] have achieved good results. However, these technologies require drug developers to have a certain knowledge of biological and drug delivery systems, and the safety, selectivity, and drug clearance rates need further exploration [42].\nIn order to develop more small molecules that can specifically degrade PD-L1, the following aspects can be explored: It is feasible to obtain compounds that can degrade PD-L1 from old drugs or combine these drugs with immune stimulators to solve the shortcomings of existing drugs, such as Metformin, Canagliflozin, Amlodipine, and EGFR inhibitors. In addition, it is also feasible to find drugs that reduce PD-L1 from some natural products such as Dendrobium and Triptolide [123,151]. Exploit proteins or signaling pathways that can be involved in PD-L1, such as inhibiting the protein CMTM4/6 that maintains PD-L1 stability [152,153], using the REIC/DKK-3 protein to destroy the roles of CMTM6 and PD-L1 [154], or activating the AMPK pathway [155], or activating the negative regulatory protein zymogen granule protein 16 (ZG16) of PD-L1 [156], may reduce the stability of PD-L1 and lead to its degradation. Harnessing the potential of newly identified E3 enzymes, particularly those cell membrane E3 ligases like ZNRF3/RNF43 or deubiquitinases that are specific for degrading PD-L1, offers a promising pathway for the development of corresponding PROTACs or inhibitors. These designed molecules aim to amplify the degradation of the PD-L1 protein, providing a novel approach to enhance immunotherapy efficacy by targeting and modulating immune checkpoint functions [157,158]. The role of ubiquitinases or deubiquitinases, such as USP22 and CSN5, in the ubiquitination regulation of PD-L1 is also worth exploring [159]. The development of inhibitors or PROTACs related to PD-L1 glycosylation or palmitoylation is a promising direction for PD-L1 degradation, such as peptide-PROTACs targeting PD-L1 palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC3 (DHHC3), rather than directly targeting PD-L1 [160]. It is of great value to develop more small molecules that induce the internalization of PD-L1 and degradation using the autophagy-lysosome pathway [11,51,52,54]. This type of molecule can inhibit and degrade PD-L1 to exert a dual immune effect and has a good development prospect.\nOverall, this research direction provides a potential strategy for improving the tumor immune microenvironment and immunotherapy. PD-L1 degraders, as an emerging immunotherapy strategy, have potential therapeutic advantages and prospects [161]. However, these drugs still need further research and development to improve their specificity, efficacy, and safety. At the same time, individualized treatment should be carried out according to the patient's specific situation, including factors such as tumor types, PD-L1 expression level, and immune status. In the future, with the continuous advancement of technology and the deepening of research, it is believed that PD-L1-degrading agents will become an important way of treating tumors, bringing better therapeutic effects and quality of life to patients. \n**CRediT authorship contribution statement**\n**Declaration of Competing Interest**\nThe work described has not been submitted elsewhere for publication, in whole or in part, and it is not being submitted to any other journal. All the authors listed have reviewed the final version of the manuscript and approve it for publication.\n\n\nPD-L1 is an important immune checkpoint protein that can bind to T cells' PD-1 receptor, thereby promoting immune escape from tumors. In recent years, many researchers have developed strategies to degrade PD-L1 to improve the effect of immunotherapy. The study of degrading PD-L1 provides new opportunities for immunotherapy. Here, we mainly summarize and review the current active molecules and mechanisms that mediate the degradation of immature and mature PD-L1 during the post-translational modification stages, involving PD-L1 phosphorylation, glycosylation, palmitoylation, ubiquitination, and the autophagy-lysosomal process. This review expects that by degrading PD-L1 protein, we will not only gain a better understanding of oncogenic mechanisms involving tumor PD-L1 protein but also provide a new way to improve immunotherapy.\n\n",
