    "abstract": "Deviations from the normal physicochemical and functional properties of pulmonary surfactants are associated with the incidence of lung injury and other respiratory disorders. This study aims to evaluate the alteration of the 2D molecular organization and morphology of pulmonary surfactant model membranes by the electronic cigarette additives alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and alpha-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E acetate), which have been associated with lung injury, termed e-cigarette or vaping-use-associated lung injury (EVALI). The model membranes used contained a 7:3 molar ratio of DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and POPG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol) to which alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocopherol acetate were added to form mixtures of up to 20 mol % additive. The properties of the neat tocopherol additives and DPPC/POPG (7:3) mixtures with increasing molar proportions of additive were evaluated by surface pressure-area isotherms, excess area calculations, Brewster angle microscopy, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, and atomic force microscopy. The addition of either additive alters the essential phase balance of the model pulmonary surfactant membrane by generating a greater proportion of the fluid phase. Despite this net fluidization, both tocopherol additives have space-filling effects on the liquid-expanded and condensed phases, yielding negative excess areas in the liquid-expanded phase and reduced tilt angles in the condensed phase. Both tocopherol additives alter the stability of the fluid phase, pushing the eventual collapse of this phase to higher surface pressures than the model membrane in the absence of an additive.\n"
