    "fullText": "**Introduction**\nImmune checkpoints comprise a series of molecules expressed on the surface of immune cells. They serve as regulators of immune activation, crucial for maintaining autoimmune tolerance and preventing excessive immune system activation. Over recent decades, numerous immune checkpoint molecules have been identified, including but not limited to programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), T cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain 3 (TIM3), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT), natural killer group 2, member D (NKG2D), and cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47). These molecules form intricate regulatory networks that precisely modulate the type and intensity of immune responses [1][2][3][4][5]. Tumor cells can evade immune surveillance by exploiting immune checkpoint pathways to suppress immune responses. However, antibody blockade or recombinant proteins that modulate these pathways can reverse this inhibition, enabling immune cells to re-engage in their cytotoxic functions. Consequently, the blockade of immune checkpoints in treatment has garnered unprecedented attention. Simultaneously, we face challenges and bottlenecks in the development of immunotherapies. Presently, immune checkpoint therapy is primarily employed as a second-line treatment for certain advanced cancers. The current study seeks to ascertain whether improved efficacy and predictive indicators can extend the benefits of immune checkpoint blockade to early-stage anticancer interventions, benefiting a broader patient population. The persistence of drug resistance, encompassing both acquired and natural resistance, stands as a substantial impediment in the landscape of cancer immunotherapy [6].\nFollowing anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 treatments, patients with diverse tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, etc., exhibit an up-regulation of compensatory inhibitory checkpoint signals such as TIM3 and LAG3, leading to acquired drug resistance [7][8][9][10][11]. While single-agent treatments with TIM3-blocking antibodies like LY3321367 or sabatolimab [12][13][14][15], and IMP321 (a soluble dimeric recombinant form of LAG3) have shown limited efficacy in advanced solid tumor patients [16][17][18], recent research suggests promise. For instance, treatment with TSR-022 (an anti-TIM3 monoclonal antibody) alone resulted in disease stabilization (SD) in 31 melanoma or NSCLC patients and partial responses (PR) in a smooth muscle sarcoma patient with no observed dose-limiting toxicity [19]. Multiple studies indicate that combining TIM3 or LAG3 inhibitors with PD-1 blockade therapy significantly enhances anti-tumor activity compared to monotherapy, and patients tolerate the combination well [14,15,[17][18][19]. Notably, the FDA approved Relatlimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting LAG3, in combination with Nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 inhibitor) for treating metastatic melanoma in 2022 [20]. This emphasizes the potential of combination therapies with novel immune checkpoint blockade in overcoming acquired resistance and improving treatment outcomes in various cancers.\nThe limited therapeutic efficacy of various PD-1/PD-L1 immunosuppressants in most solid tumors may be attributed to the reduced infiltration of T cells in solid tumors, accompanied by a high presence of immunosuppressive myeloid cells, resulting in natural resistance [21]. A promising immunotherapy target on myeloid cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), is the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 pathway, known as the \"don't eat me\" signal to prevent tumor cells phagocytosis. Recent clinical trials indicate that while CD47 blockade shows good efficacy in several hematological tumors, its therapeutic impact on solid tumors is constrained. However, selective SIRP\u03b1 blockade demonstrates improved efficacy with milder hematological side effects in solid cancers. The objective response rate (ORR) of SIRP\u03b1 blockade is notably higher than that of anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, especially in combination therapy [22]. These findings suggest that dysfunctional macrophage accumulation in the tumor immune microenvironment might be a key factor in immune escape and non-responsiveness to immunotherapy in solid tumors. Blocking myeloid cells through the CD47-SIRP\u03b1 axis holds clinical promise for immunotherapy in solid tumors. Researchers also discovered that specific knockout of TIM3 in CD8 + T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), or natural killer cells (NK cells) did not significantly affect tumor growth. However, knocking out TIM3 in DCs significantly inhibited tumor growth [23]. This indicates that, in comparison to T cells, TIM3 on myeloid cells plays a more critical role in tumor immunity by mediating antigen presentation and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, inhibiting the activation of inflammasomes, and interfering with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway in DCs [23,24]. In summary, targeting novel immune checkpoints, especially those related to myeloid cells like SIRP\u03b1 and TIM3, holds promise for patients who are refractory to conventional immunotherapy approaches.\nIndeed, the intricate mechanisms and biological functions of new immune checkpoint molecules are still areas of active investigation [25][26][27][28][29][30][31]. Understanding the protein structure and regulatory mechanisms of these novel immune checkpoints is crucial for improving the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients who are resistant to current therapies. Post-translational modification (PTM) involves the addition or removal of functional groups, proteins, lipids, or sugars from amino acid side chains. This process is catalyzed by various enzymes, including kinases, phosphatases, ligases, and transferases. Alternatively, it can occur through chemical modifications by hydrolases, which cut peptide bonds, removing specific sequences or regulating subunits. This essential regulatory mechanism plays a pivotal role in cell physiological processes, including immune function and tumor pathogenesis. PTM regulates immune checkpoint molecules by modulating their activity, stabilizing protein structures, influencing localization, and mediating interactions with other molecules [32][33][34][35]. Despite the challenges associated with studying PTMs, researchers have diligently explored different modifications affecting the expression of immune checkpoint proteins and their ligands. Notably, glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, neddylation, palmitoylation, and ectodomain shedding have been identified as key PTMs in this context [32][33][34][35]. Characterizing these post-translational modifications provides valuable insights into novel immune checkpoint molecules, unveiling new targets and therapeutic avenues for cancer immunotherapy.\n\n**Types of post-translation modification**\nGlycosylation is a complex process that the transfer of core glycan from lipid-linked intermediates to peptide receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), followed by glycan trimming through Glc removal through glucosidase (GlsII\u03b1/\u03b2, GlsI) to fold glycoproteins. Correctly folded proteins are packed for transport to the Golgi apparatus, where a series of ordered modification processes occur, such as polyglycation, fucosylation, galactosylation. Completely folded glycoproteins are recognized by a folding sensor called the glycoprotein glucosyltransferase UGGT1, and glycosylated again. Accumulation of unfolded or incorrectly folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum can cause damage and trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) [36] (Fig. 1A). Glycosylation is categorized into two main types: N-glycosylation, which attaches the glycosylation chain to the asparagine residues (-NH2), and O-glycosylation, which links the glycosylation chain to the oxygen atoms of serine, threonine, or hydroxylysine within the polypeptide chain. The N-glycan chains contain a common pentasaccharide core, which is further modified into three major classes of N-glycan chains: high mannose, hybrid, and complex [37] (Fig. 1A). The O-glycosylation sites lack a conserved protein signature sequence and exhibit various core structures. While their monosaccharide composition is typically straightforward, their structure is intricate due to the diversity and connectivity of subtypes [38]. In the tumor microenvironment, factors such as hypoxia and abnormal cellular glycolysis induce extensive and multilevel changes in protein glycosylation patterns, leading to phenomena such as incomplete or abnormally increased glycan synthesis. Glycosylation of immune checkpoint molecules plays a crucial role in enhancing protein stability and thus their half-life in vivo. Additionally, it regulates their interaction with antibodies or ligands and influences protein dimerization [39].\nPhosphorylation is a fundamental cellular process involving the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to amino acid residues of proteins, typically tyrosine or serine/threonine. This enzymatic reaction is catalyzed by protein kinases, and its reverse process involves the removal of the phosphate group by protein phosphatases [40,41] (Fig. 1B). In the context of immune checkpoint molecules, tyrosine phosphorylation often serves as a molecular switch, activating downstream signal cascades. On the other hand, serine/threonine phosphorylation is primarily associated with ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation, leading to a reduction in protein expression [32].\nUnlike single groups added by phosphorylation modification, ubiquitin (Ub) is a small molecule protein consisting of 76 amino acids and has a highly conserved sequence. The ubiquitination process involves a series of enzymatic steps culminating in the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a target protein. Initially, ubiquitin is activated in conjunction with ATP by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1. Subsequently, the cysteine site of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 forms a thioester bond with ubiquitin. The ubiquitin ligase E3 then facilitates the ubiquitination of the substrate by mediating the formation of isopeptide bonds between the carboxyl group of ubiquitin and lysine residues in the substrate. In this cascade of enzymatic reactions, E3 assumes a key role in the specific recognition of target proteins and the regulation of ubiquitination system activity. Depending on the manner of binding, ubiquitination can manifest in different forms: monoubiquitination, where a single ubiquitin molecule is bound to the target protein; multi-ubiquitination, where multiple lysine residues of the target protein are simultaneously labeled by a single ubiquitin molecule; and poly-ubiquitination, where a single lysine residue of the target protein is labeled by multiple ubiquitin molecules [34,42]. Ubiquitination is a reversible modification, and the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) catalyzes the reverse reaction [43] (Fig. 1C). Immune checkpoint molecules undergo ubiquitination, marking them for recognition and subsequent degradation by proteasomes [34].\nSmall ubiquitin-associated modifier (SUMO) and neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 8 (NEDD8) are small peptides akin to ubiquitin. Like ubiquitin, their modification process involves corresponding E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, which classifies them under the umbrella term of ubiquitin-like (Ubl) proteins [44].\nSUMO encompasses 100 amino acid residues, sharing only 18% sequence similarity with ubiquitin. However, structurally, it closely resembles ubiquitin, featuring the conserved Ub-fold domain at its core [45]. SUMOylation, the process of adding SUMO to a protein, is dynamic and can be reversed by a specific protease known as SUMO-specific protease (SENP) (Fig. 1D). NEDD8 comprises 81 amino acid residues and shares a substantial 80% similarity to ubiquitin [44]. NEDD8 precursors require the action of mature enzymes to cleave the C-terminal end at glycine 76 for it to become functional [46]. The E1 enzyme responsible for NEDD8 activation is known as the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE), which facilitates its attachment to the NEDD8-binding enzyme E2 (UBC12). Subsequently, the NEDD8 ligase E3 is catalyzed to bind with the lysine residue on the target protein. Much like ubiquitination and SUMOylation, neddylation is a reversible process. It can be counteracted by enzymes such as NEDP1, CSN5, and UCH-L3 [47][48][49] (Fig. 1E). SUMOylation or Neddylation of a protein can have dual effects. On one hand, it may facilitate proteasomal degradation through the Cullin-RING ligase (CRL) [50,51]. On the other hand, it can competitively counteract ubiquitination, thereby augmenting protein stability [52]. Additionally, neddylation has regulatory roles in protein activity or function [53].\nProtein palmitoylation involves the Golgi apparatus as the reaction center, where palmitoyl groups are attached to amino acid residues on the side chain of proteins. Its primary form involves S-palmitoylation modification, wherein a 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitic acid, forms a covalent linkage with the cysteine (Cys) residue on protein side chains through an unstable thioester bond [54,55]. This process is regulated by aspartate-histidine-histidine cysteine (DHHC) palmitoyltransferase and acyl-protein thioesterase (APT) [56] (Fig. 1F). Palmitoylation of immune checkpoint molecules stabilizes their protein structure, facilitating efficient transport and localization to the plasma membrane. This process up-regulates their expression on the cell membrane, thereby enhancing their functional activity [31].\nEctodomain shedding, facilitated by proteolytic enzymes such as a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs), transforms transmembrane molecules into soluble forms [57]. In the context of tumor cells, this shedding process may generate ligands for immune activation receptors. By reducing the membrane expression of these ligands, ectodomain shedding functions as a regulatory mechanism. The shed structures serve as bait, binding to corresponding receptors and, consequently, inhibiting the immune activation signal pathway [58] (Fig. 1G).\n**Posttranslational modification of TIM3 and its ligands**\nTIM3, encoded by the HAVCR2 gene, is a type I membrane protein characterized by distinct structural elements, including a signal peptide (SP), an IgV domain, a mucin domain, a stem region, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and a cytoplasmic region (CR) [59] (Fig. 2A). TIM3 is expressed in various immune cell types, encompassing T cells, Tregs, DCs, B cells, macrophages, NK cells, and mast cells.\nTIM3 operates as an immune negative regulator, and the complete understanding of its inhibitory signaling mechanism remains elusive. TIM3 engages with four ligands: Galectin-9 (Gal-9), CEA cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and high mobility family protein B1 (HMGB1) [59] (Fig. 2B). It is hypothesized that TIM3 needs to bind with these specific ligands to exert its immunosuppressive role [25][26][27]. Among these ligands, Gal-9 was the first to be identified. It functions as a carbohydrate-binding protein with specific recognition of the N-linked glycosylation within the IgV domain of TIM3 [60] (Fig. 2B). Studies have demonstrated that stimulation of TIM3 by human Gal-9 leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of Y265 [61]. In mice, TIM3 exerts its immunosuppressive functions through the phosphorylation of Y256 and Y263 [62,63]. These phosphorylated residues in the C-terminal of TIM3 bind to SH2-containing STAT1, subsequently inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation and its translocation into the nucleus. This leads to the downregulation of miR-155, a reduced inhibition of SOCS1 expression, an increase in the expression of IL-10 and Arg-1, ultimately resulting in the polarization of macrophages into M2 phenotypes [62]. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Y256 and Y263 in Tim3 also serves to inhibit the activation of the inflammasome NLRP3 [63]. Bat3 binds to residues 252-270 of TIM3, suppressing Tim-dependent T cell exhaustion. Gal-9 can disrupt this interaction by inducing the phosphorylation of the two tyrosine residues (Y256 and Y263) at the C-terminus of TIM3 [29] (Fig. 2B). The binding sites for PtdSer, CEACAM1, and HMGB1 rely on hydrophobic residues located within the FGCC ring [59,64] (Fig. 2B). The transport of PtdSer in mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) is under the regulation of MET30, a substrate recognition subgroup of the SCF ubiquitination ligase [65,66]. When TIM3 is not bound to these ligands, the transmembrane domain of TIM3 positively regulates its localization efficiency to immune synapses. Moreover, its cytoplasmic tail contains intrinsic costimulatory activity, effectively activating T cells [28]. Paradoxically, the expression of TIM3 may lead to T cell exhaustion through continuous TCR signaling after the short-term activation of T cells [29,30].\nTIM3 undergoes extracellular domain shedding mediated by ADAM10 and ADAM17. This process results in the generation of a soluble form of TIM3. Interestingly, this shedding is induced by PMA and can be prevented when the amino acids Glu181 to Asp190 within the stem region are absent [67] (Fig. 2B).\n**Post-translational modification of LAG3 and its ligand MHC-II**\nLAG3, also known as CD233, is a Type I transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. It is primarily expressed in activated T cells, NK cells, B cells, and plasma-like DCs [68]. The structure of LAG3 encompasses three main components: the extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions. Within the extracellular domain, there are distinct segments including a signal peptide, a IgV domain, three IgC2 domains, and a splicing peptide [69].\nNotably, the IgV domain and the IgC2-type 1 domain serve as binding sites for LAG3 ligands such as major histocompatibility complex-II (MHC-II) and fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) [31]. Additionally, the binding peptides in this domain act as sites for the metalloproteinases ADAM10 and ADAM17 [70,71]. The cytoplasmic domain of LAG3 comprises three elements: the potential serine phosphorylation site S484, the \"KIEELE\" motif, and the glutamate-proline dipeptide repeating motif (EP sequence) [72]. Studies have demonstrated that the key components of the KIEELE motif play a crucial role in LAG3 immune suppression [73]. However, another study suggested that both S484 and EP sequences are vital components for LAG3 to function. Moreover, S484 may potentially serve as a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) [72]. LAG3 exhibits a range of ligands including MHC-II, Galectin-3, LSECtin, and FGL1. Nevertheless, the identity of its ligand remains a subject of debate and necessitates further elucidation. Among these, MHC-II is the primary ligand for LAG3. Galectin-3 is a soluble lectin known for its affinity to galactosides, while LSECtin belongs to the superfamily of C-type lectin receptors. FGL1, discovered by Professor Lieping Chen's team, is an LAG3 ligand independent of MHC-II function. The interaction between FGL1 and LAG3 promotes tumor immune evasion [31] (Fig. 3A).\nThe LAG3 protein undergoes cleavage by ADAM10 and ADAM17 enzymes, resulting in the breakage of the splicing peptide and the release of soluble LAG3 (sLAG3). This sLAG3 can then bind to MHC-II, activating anti-tumor effects in T cells [71].\nMHC-II, the main ligand of LAG3, is regulated by ubiquitination modification. Proteins from the MARCH family, particularly MARCH1 and MARCH8, play a role in downregulating the cell surface expression of MHC-II in dendritic cells (DC), B cells, and monocytes. They achieve this by ubiquitinating the K225 residues in the cytoplasmic region of MHC-II [74]. Additionally, CD83 acts in opposition to the E3 ligase MARCH8, thereby stabilizing MHC-II [75]. Furthermore, Salmonella effector (SteD) facilitates the interaction between the TMEM127/WWP2 complex and MHC-II. This interaction leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MHC-II on the surface of DCs [76] (Fig. 3B).\n**Post-translational modification of TIGIT/DNAM-1 and its ligands CD155 and CD112**\n**Structure of TIGIT/DNAM-1 and its ligands CD155 and CD112**\nThe immunosuppressive receptor TIGIT is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a structure comprising a signal peptide, an IgV domain, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail that houses an immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif (ITIM) and an immunoglobulin tyrosine tail-like motif [77] (Fig. 4A). TIGIT interacts with multiple ligands, including CD155 (Necl-5), CD112 (Nectin-2), CD113 (Nectin-3), and PVRL4 (Nectin-4) [78]. Nectin and Necl proteins, which are cell-surface glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, play crucial roles in these interactions. The Nectin family encompasses four members (Nectin-1 to Nectin-4), while the Necl family comprises five members (Necl-1 to Necl-5). These proteins feature three Ig extracellular domains that form homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes within the membrane. CD155, for instance, consists of a signal peptide, an IgV domain, two IgC2 domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with an ITIM (Fig. 4C). CD112, on the other hand, contains a signal peptide, an IgV domain, two IgC2 domains, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain [78,79] (Fig. 4D).\nThe corresponding activating receptor, DNAM-1, is expressed in both T cells and NK cells. It is a transmembrane glycoprotein composed of a signal peptide, an IgC2-type 1 domain, an IgC2-type 2 domain, a Type I transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain [80]. Within the intracellular domain of DNAM-1, there are two highly conserved phosphorylation sites, Y322 and S329 in humans, and Y319 and S326 in mice [81][82][83] (Fig. 4B).\n**Post-translational modification of TIGIT**\nThe cytoplasmic tail of TIGIT serves as the initiator for a cascade of inhibitory signals. In human TIGIT, the ITT-like motif (Y225 and Y231) has been identified as a key player in mediating significant inhibition of signaling [84]. Following the binding of TIGIT to its ligand, the cytoplasmic tail is phosphorylated and then associates with the solute adaptor GRB2. This interaction facilitates the recruitment of SHIP-1, which contains the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Subsequently, SHIP-1 works to suppress the signaling cascade of PI3K and MAPK [84] (Fig. 4E).\n**Post-translational modification of DNAM-1**\nPhosphorylation of DNAM-1 at Y322 is crucial for TIGIT blockade [83]. When both TIGIT and DNAM-1 are present, CD155 shows a preference for binding to TIGIT [85]. This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of TIGIT, resulting in the inhibition of T cell response. However, TIGIT blockade disrupts CD155-induced TIGIT phosphorylation, subsequently restoring the phosphorylation of DNAM-1 at Y322 and ultimately promoting T cell activation [83]. PKC phosphorylates specific serine residues (S329) of DNAM-1, facilitating the association of LFA-1 with DNAM-1 [86]. This interaction leads to the binding of LFA-1 to ICAM-1, inducing a conformational change and subsequent recruitment of Fyn. This in turn triggers the phosphorylation of Y322 residues of DNAM-1, ultimately activating effector T cells [87]. In the presence of LFA-1, DNAM-1 is dephosphorylated by PD-1-SHP2, but treatment with PD-1 antibodies leads to a high level of phosphorylation [88] (Fig. 4E).\nThe expression of DNAM-1 is post-translationally regulated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In conjunction with CD155, mouse DNAM-1 undergoes phosphorylation at Y319 by the kinase Scr. This phosphorylation event subsequently recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cblb, leading to the ubiquitination of phosphorylated DNAM-1 and its subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation [89] (Fig. 4E).\n**Post-translational modification of CD155 and CD112**\nPhosphorylation of CD155 affects its function. When DNAM-1 binds to human CD155, Y398 within the ITIM of CD155 undergoes phosphorylation, subsequently recruiting SHP-2. This event is accompanied by the dephosphorylation of plaque kinases and pilin, leading to the  inhibition of cell adhesion and an increase in cellular mobility [90]. In cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the activation of the UPR inhibits the surface expression of CD155 and promotes its degradation [91].\nMoreover, ubiquitination and SUMOylation play negative regulatory roles in the surface expression of CD112 and CD155 in tumor cells.\nWhile ubiquitinated CD112 is retained within the intracellular compartment, it is also targeted for proteasomal degradation. The US2 gene product of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) mediates the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of CD112 via TRC8, with the assistance of the maintenance enzyme UL141 [92]. CD155 can be modulated through SUMO modification, and inhibiting SUMOylation facilitates the transfer of CD155 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane [93]. Inhibiting the Ubiquitin and SUMO pathways results in increased expression of CD112 and CD155 on the cell surface, rendering tumor cells more susceptible to NK-cell-mediated killing [94] (Fig. 4E).\n**Post-translational modification of KIR and MHC-I**\nKiller cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) constitute a group of polymorphic transmembrane glycoproteins primarily expressed on NK cells. KIRs play a critical role in regulating NK cell function, functioning as both activators and inhibitors. They possess a long intracellular domain and a short intracellular domain [95].\nAmong the confirmed KIR ligands, MHC-I stands out. There's a consistent pattern of ubiquitination observed in MHC-II and CD86. Homologous products such as miR1, miR2, murine \u03b3-herpesvirus-K3 (mK3) , M153R of myxoma virus, MARCH4, and MARCH9 have been reported to reduce MHC-I expression. They achieve this by binding to lysine (K63) in the cytoplasmic tail of the MHC-I protein, consequently triggering endocytosis and lysosomal degradation [96]. Interestingly, some viruses can mediate MHC-I ubiquitination even in the absence of a lysine residue in the cytoplasmic tail. For instance, the US2 gene product of the HCMV is known to mediate MHC-I polyubiquitination hydrolysis through TRC8. Additionally, the US11 gene product facilitates the hydrolysis of MHC-I polyubiquitination by interacting with Derlin-1, which in turn binds to TMEM129, an uncharacterized RING-C2 E3 ligase [97] (Fig. 4E).\n**Post-translational modification of NKG2D and its ligands MICA/B and ULBP2**\nNKG2D is a type II transmembrane receptor protein (42 KDa) encoded by the KLRK1 gene. It comprises an intracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain containing a type C lectin domain [98]. The ligands for NKG2D include human major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A and B) (MICA and MICB) and human ULBP1-6. Most of these are multi-segment transmembrane proteins, but some, such as ULBP1/2/3/6, lack a transmembrane structure and are anchored to the cell membrane by glycophosphatidylinositol. These can be preferentially released via an exosome form [99] (Fig. 5A-D).\nMICA, MICB, and ULBP2 can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ADAMs to form soluble proteins. In glioblastoma, ADAM10 and ADAM17 contribute to an immunosuppressive phenotype by hydrolyzing and cleaving ULBP2 [100]. Additionally, MICA binds to endoplasmic reticulin 5 (ERp5; also known as PDIA6 or P5) on the surface of tumor cells, where ERp5 is necessary for MICA shedding. ERp5 and membrane-anchored MICA form a transient hybrid disulfide complex, leading to the release of soluble MICA through proteolytic cleavage near the cell membrane [101] (Fig. 5E).\nFatty acylation and palmitoylation of MICA/B impact protein recruitment in the membrane microdomain, thereby affecting proteolytic cleavage. The 306th and 307th cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail of MICA, which are 330th and 331th in the total length of the peptide chain, are crucial for MICA palmitoylation and recruitment to DRM/caveolae, promoting the release of soluble MICA molecules [102] (Fig. 5C).\nMICA also possesses multiple N-linked glycosylation sites. It has been reported that hypoxia inhibits N-glycosylation of MICA protein, consequently suppressing its expression on the cell surface [103]. While N-glycosylation is not essential for interaction with MICA/NKG2D, it enhances complex formation [104] (Fig. 5E).\nLong-term exposure to soluble or membrane-bound NKG2DLs leads to the downregulation of receptor expression. Studies have indicated that c-Cbl serves as a ubiquitin ligase to degrade NKG2D when bound with NKG2D, triggered by c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation [105]. The immature form of MICA accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum and undergoes degradation via the ubiquitin pathway and lysosomal processes. Histamine reduces MICA by activating H1R and H2R-mediated ubiquitin-proteasome pathways, ultimately reducing sensitivity to NK cells [106] (Fig. 5E).\n**Post-translational modification of CD47 and its ligand SIRP\u03b1**\nCD47 is a transmembrane protein commonly found on the surface of normal cells. Its molecular structure comprises an extracellular variable domain at the N-end, five hydrophobic transmembrane helix structures, and a very short intracellular signaling sequence at the C-terminal [107]. By binding to SIRP\u03b1, CD47 inhibits the phagocytosis of macrophages. This interaction is often overexpressed on the surface of tumor cells, acting as an \"accomplice\" in immune evasion. SIRP\u03b1, also known as SHPS-1, is a transmembrane protein with an IgV domain at the NH2 end and two IgC domains that interact with CD47 [107] (Fig. 6A).\nThe combination of CD47 with SIRP\u03b1 induces the phosphorylation of tyrosine in SIRP\u03b1 ITIM. Phosphorylated ITIM then recruits and activates the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 protein. The activated tyrosine phosphatase further dephosphorylates a series of proteins in the cell, ultimately inhibiting macrophage phagocytosis [108]. EGFR activation leads to increased CD47 expression by enhancing c-Src binding to CD47. This, in turn, triggers c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of CD47 at Y288. This phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM21 and CD47, preventing TRIM21-mediated K99/102 multi-ubiquitination and degradation of CD47 [109] (Fig. 6B).\n**Post-translational modification of B7-H4**\nB7-H4, encoded by the VTCN1 gene, is a GPI-conjugated protein that comprises a signal peptide, two IgV-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region [110] (Fig. 6C). This protein is expressed in activated T and B cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells. It's notably overexpressed in multiple tumors but absent in most normal tissues [111]. In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the stability of B7-H4 is governed by AMFR-mediated ubiquitination and STT3A-dependent glycosylation [112]. UGGG1, an ER-associated enzyme, selectively glycosylates unfolded proteins, thereby promoting the glycosylation of B7-H4 [112,113] (Fig. 6D).\n**Post-translational modification of B7-H6**\nB7-H6, encoded by the NCR3LG1 gene, is a type I transmembrane protein consisting of a signal peptide, an IgV-like domain with multiple glycosylation sites, an IgC1-like domain, and transmembrane and intracellular regions [110] (Fig. 6E). This protein exhibits specific expression in various tumor tissues and acts as a membrane-binding ligand for the surface-activating receptor NKp30 in NK cells. B7-H6 can be shed from the cell surface in the form of exosomes, generating soluble B7-H6 on the cell surface, which subsequently downregulates NKp30-mediated NK cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. This extracellular shedding of B7-H6 relies on cleavage through the hydrolytic action of ADAM10 and ADAM17 [114] (Fig. 6F).\n**Clinical translation and future perspectives of posttranslational modification of immune checkpoint**\nCancer immunotherapy, particularly targeting immune checkpoint molecules, has emerged as a pivotal area of research in recent years. Despite its promise, it faces various limitations, such as the limited efficacy observed when using TIM3 and LAG3 blocking antibodies alone. Additionally, the use of CD47 antibodies or SIRP\u03b1-Fc may result in erythrocyte toxicity [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]22]. To address these challenges, this summary explores the post-translational modifications of immune checkpoints, clarifies the molecular mechanisms governing these modifications, and suggests novel targets that could function as both biomarkers and potential therapeutic avenues for unleashing immune system blockades. In addition, these novel immune checkpoint therapies, in combination with other drugs, may be critical to improving outcomes for more patients.\nOne critical aspect influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy is glycosylation modification. Notably, NGI-1, an OST small molecule inhibitor, demonstrates significant potential [112]. It functions by inhibiting the activities of STT3A and STT3B, subsequently impeding the glycosylation of B7-H4 of TNBC. This, in turn, leads to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the protein. In parallel, glucose analogs like 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) have emerged as competitive inhibitors of hexose kinases, effectively suppressing glycolysis. Furthermore, they interfere with the synthesis of N-glycosylation in proteins. Notably, 2-DG exerts its influence by inhibiting the N-glycosylation of MICA, thus preventing its expression on the surface of osteosarcoma cells [103]. The impact of glycosylation isn't confined to protein targets alone. Therapeutic antibodies, vital in immune checkpoint blockade strategies, are also subject to glycosylation modification. For instance, SEA-TGT, a monoclonal antibody designed to counteract TIGIT non-ligand glycosylation, leverages proprietary glycoengineered antibody (SEA) technology (Fig. 7). This augmentation significantly enhances its Fc-\u03b3 RIIIa affinity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. The combined administration of SEA-TGT and anti-PD-1 antibodies holds tremendous promise in depleting TIGIT-overexpressing T cells, thereby reinstating T cell populations and bolstering anti-tumor immune responses in the mouse models of colorectal cancer and renal cell carcinoma [115]. Presently, SEA-TGT is undergoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials for the treatment of advanced solid tumors and lymphomas, marked by identifiers NCT04254107 and NCT04585815 (Fig. 7, Table 1).\nThe administration of the MMP broad-spectrum inhibitor Batimastat has demonstrated a notable augmentation in NK cell activity. This effect is attributed to the reduction in serum levels of sULBP2, concomitant with an increase in ULBP2 expression within cancer cells [116]. Furthermore, inhibitors with specificities towards ADAM, such as GW280264X, the MMP inhibitor Periostat, and the FAAH inhibitor URB597, exhibit potential in mitigating sMICA/B-induced tumor immune evasion in breast cancer and liver cancer models [117][118][119]. Presently, only Periostat has progressed to clinical trial stages of melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (NCT01590082 and NCT02086591). Despite some setbacks faced by MMP and ADAM inhibitors in clinical trials, their candidacy as therapeutic targets remains compelling, as supported by encouraging preclinical outcomes. Of particular significance is the recent development of functionally blocking antibodies against ADAM17. In a co-culture model of NK cells and ovarian cancer cells, the anti-ADAM17 monoclonal antibody MEDI3622 effectively inhibited ADAM17 in NK cells, leading to increased IFN-\u03b3 secretion [120]. (Fig. 7, Table 1).\nSeveral monoclonal antibodies targeting MICA have exhibited promising preclinical efficacy. The use of the sMICA neutralizing and non-blocking monoclonal antibody (B10G5) enhances the sensitivity of MIC-expressing tumor cells to NK cell killing in mouse prostate cancer models with specific human MIC expression. This leads to effective regression of primary tumors and elimination of metastasis without inducing systemic toxicity [121]. Similar positive outcomes were observed in the NSG mouse model of human pancreatic cancer cells [122]. Notably, the combination of B10G5 with PD-L1 blockade significantly enhances the synergistic therapeutic effects of NK cells and CD8 + T cells on melanoma [121]. Another MICA/B-specific monoclonal antibody, denoted as 7C6, has shown inhibitory effects on the growth of various malignancies, including melanoma, colon, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. This effect is attributed to the antibody's ability to counteract the loss of MICA and MICB [123]. Furthermore, 7C6 has displayed synergistic effects with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), particularly in stabilizing MICA/B expression on the surface of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells [124]. Additionally, the chimeric protein BLS-MICA, characterized by its extracellular domain binding to Brucella spp lumazine synthase (BLS), has exhibited significant potential [125]. In vivo studies with BLS-MICA have shown the generation of high titers of anti-MICA antibodies in murine lymphoma cells and bladder cancer models stably expressing human MICA. This immune response resulted in the elimination of tumors through ADCC. MICA exhibits high expression in various cancers, including breast, colorectal, liver, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, stomach, kidney, ovarian, melanoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma (MM) [126][127][128]. This novel anti-tumor vaccine shows promise for patients with MICA-positive cancers [125].\nThe soluble LAG3-Ig fusion protein IMP321 (Eftilagimod Alpha) has been demonstrated to enhance T-lymphocyte-mediated antitumor immunity in targeted mouse models [129]. IMP321 is currently undergoing clinical trials as an immune-enhancing agent in breast cancer, melanoma, NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT03252938, NCT00349934, NCT00351949, NCT02676869, NCT01308294, NCT02614833), with ongoing investigations into its combination with antiviral vaccines, chemotherapy, and other anti-tumor therapies [130][131][132] (Fig. 7, Table 1).\nProteasome inhibitors wield significant influence over the destiny of ubiquitinated ligands. Bortezomib, an FDA-approved reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, has shown the ability, even at low doses, to upregulate the expression of NK cell activation ligands on multiple myeloma cells, including CD155, CD112, and ULBPs. However, the precise mechanism underlying this effect remains to be elucidated [133]. Furthermore, bortezomib has been found to upregulate the expression of MICA/B by inhibiting proteasome activity [133].\nWhile the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 pathway is a promising candidate for current cancer immunotherapy, systemic blockade of CD47 (also expressed on red blood cells) can lead to severe anemia. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) technology is a novel drug strategy to degrade targeted proteins utilizing the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). It has been proved to achieve cell/tissue selectivity and alleviate the toxicity of traditional small molecule inhibitors [134]. Existing studies indicate that the use of nano-protein-hydrolyzing targeted chimeras (nano--PROTACs) induces targeted degradation of SHP-2, thereby disrupting the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 pathway [135]. Furthermore, E3 ligase-dependent ubiquitination has been well validated in the regulation of CD47  degradation [109]. Therefore, we hypothesize that inhibition of the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 axis by PROTAC holds broad potential for future drug development.\nPevonedistat (MLN4924, TAK-924) stands out as a first-in-class NAE inhibitor with a low molecular weight. In the context of multiple myeloma, which is characterized by diminished anti-cancer/cytotoxic activity of NK cells, Pevonedistat demonstrates the capacity to inhibit neddylation of MICB in various multiple myeloma cell lines. This action induces the accumulation of MICB on the cell membrane [136]. Currently, Pevonedistat is under clinical investigation for various malignancies, including AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), MM, lymphoma, and other hematologic malignancies (ClinicalT rials.gov identifiers: NCT01814826, NCT00911066, NCT03323034, NCT03745352, NCT03770260, NCT03862157, NCT03479268, and NCT03268954) [137,138]. It is also part of phase I/II clinical trials for solid tumors such as NSCLC, breast cancer, HNSCC, ovarian cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), colorectal cancer (CRC), melanoma, gastric cancer, etc (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT01862328, NCT03323034, NCT03965689, NCT03057366, NCT04175912, and jRCT2031190020) [139,140]. Notably, Pevonedistat is primarily employed in combination with other drugs. However, results from Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of MDS, CMML, and AML with a combination of Pevonedistat and AZA did not reveal a significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes compared to AZA alone. This suggests that the addition of any extra agents may impact the effectiveness of Pevonedistat. The potential use of Pevonedistat in combination with other promising therapies and its future directions remain subjects for exploration [141] (Fig. 7, Table 1).\nGinkgolic Acid (GA), an inhibitor targeting the SUMO-activating E1 enzyme SAE1/UBA2, emerges as a potent modulator. When applied to multiple myeloma cell lines or CD138 + plasma cells from patients, GA demonstrates the ability to enhance CD155 expression on MM cells [93]. This heightened activation is particularly pronounced in co-culture systems with autologous NK cells from patients, significantly promoting NK cell lysis of MM cells. Flow cytometry analysis of plasma cells from patients treated with GA further substantiates this finding by revealing an upregulation of CD155 expression [93]. Moreover, preclinical studies shed light on the potential of the selective small molecule SUMOylation inhibitor TAK-981 (Subasumstat). In mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), HCC, CD20 + lymphoma, and colorectal cancer, TAK-981 induces the activation of NK cells and CD8 + T cells, thereby enhancing the anti-tumor immune response [142][143][144][145]. Currently, TAK-981 is being assessed in clinical trials involving patients with various solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04074330, NCT04776018, NCT04381650, NCT04065555, and NCT03648372) (Fig. 7, Table 1).\nWith our deepening understanding of the etiology of diseases, it is increasingly apparent that post-translational modifications of proteins represent a pivotal class of targets with potential applications in diverse disease areas. Whether in the context of hematologic cancers or solid tumors, we anticipate that the development of innovative techniques for deciphering post-translational protein modifications will open up new avenues for advancing tumor immunotherapies, ultimately offering renewed hope for patients.\n\n\nImmune checkpoint molecules play a pivotal role in the initiation, regulation, and termination of immune responses. Tumor cells exploit these checkpoints to dampen immune cell function, facilitating immune evasion. Clinical interventions target this mechanism by obstructing the binding of immune checkpoints to their ligands, thereby restoring the anti-tumor capabilities of immune cells. Notably, therapies centered on immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blocking antibodies, have demonstrated significant clinical promise. However, a considerable portion of patients still encounter suboptimal efficacy and develop resistance. Recent years have witnessed an exponential surge in preclinical and clinical trials investigating novel immune checkpoint molecules such as TIM3, LAG3, TIGIT, NKG2D, and CD47, along with their respective ligands. The processes governing immune checkpoint molecules, from their synthesis to transmembrane deployment, interaction with ligands, and eventual degradation, are intricately tied to post-translational modifications. These modifications encompass glycosylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, neddylation, SUMOylation, palmitoylation, and ectodomain shedding. This discussion proceeds to provide a concise overview of the structural characteristics of several novel immune checkpoints and their ligands. Additionally, it outlines the regulatory mechanisms governed by post-translational modifications, offering insights into their potential clinical applications in immune checkpoint blockade.\n\n",
