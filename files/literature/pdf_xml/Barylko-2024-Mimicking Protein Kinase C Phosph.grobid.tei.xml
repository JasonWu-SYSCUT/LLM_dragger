<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) plays essential roles in diverse forms of synaptic plasticity, including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and homeostatic plasticity. In addition, it assembles into virus-like particles that may deliver mRNAs and/or other cargo between neurons and neighboring cells. Considering this broad range of activities, it is not surprising that Arc is subject to regulation by multiple types of post-translational modification, including phosphorylation, palmitoylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitylation, and acetylation. Here we explore the potential regulatory role of Arc phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC), which occurs on serines 84 and 90 within an α-helical segment in the N-terminal domain. To mimic the effect of PKC phosphorylation, we mutated the two serines to negatively charged glutamic acid. A consequence of introducing these phosphomimetic mutations is the almost complete inhibition of Arc palmitoylation, which occurs on nearby cysteines and contributes to synaptic weakening. The mutations also inhibit the binding of nucleic acids and destabilize high-order Arc oligomers. Thus, PKC phosphorylation of Arc may limit the full expression of LTD and may suppress the interneuronal transport of mRNAs.</p></div>

This finding was supported by chemical cross-linking analysis using glutaraldehyde (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2E</ref>).  Using the double-TEV GST-Arc construct, we determined that residues phosphorylated by PKC in vitro are concentrated in Arc NTD , whereas those phosphorylated by the MAP kinase ERK2 are located almost exclusively within Arc CTD , as reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3A</ref>). Arc contains four serine residues (S84, S90, S260, and S390) predicted to undergo phosphorylation by PKC <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Two of these putative PKC sites, S84 and S90, are located within the second α-helical segment of Arc NTD (residues 84-132, which we designate as "H2" in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Phosphorylation of S84 was detected in a high-throughput screen (PhosphoSite) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> but has not been further investigated. Deletion of H2 diminished PKCα-mediated phosphorylation of Arc by approximately 6-fold (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>). We confirmed by mutational analysis that serines 84 and 90 account for at least 80% of the PKC phosphorylation of segment H2 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">3D</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Discussion</head><p>This report introduces potential mechanisms of Arc regulation by PKC. First, serines 84 and 90 were identified as the major PKC phosphorylation sites. These residues are located in the N-terminal region of the second α-helix in Arc, helix H2, which comprises amino acids 84-132. Helix H2 has already been recognized as a key locus of Arc regulation. We previously reported that H2 contains a palmitoylation motif (residues 94-98) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and others have identified a SUMOylation site (Lys110) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and binding sites for endophilin (residues 91-100) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and presenilin-1 (residues 91-130) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. H2 also contains the principal determinants of Arc self-association and mRNA binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. In this study, we have focused on the potential roles of PKC phosphorylation on Arc palmitoylation and its interaction with nucleic acids.</p><p>Dynamic protein palmitoylation is a key mechanism in the control of synaptic plasticity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. In addition to targeting peripheral proteins, such as Arc, to membranes and membrane subdomains, palmitoylation can influence protein stability, subcellular localization, and protein-protein interactions. We reported a role for Arc palmitoylation in synaptic depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, but it is likely that additional functions of this modification will be identified. Reciprocal relationships between protein phosphorylation in the nervous system have been reported. Palmitoylation of synapsin 1, which controls synaptic vesicle clustering, is inhibited by PKA-mediated phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. Likewise, palmitoylation of the dopamine transporter (DAT), which increases dopamine transport and reduces DAT downregulation, is inhibited by PKC-mediated phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. In these examples, the phosphorylation sites are far apart in the protein primary structures. The close proximity of the PKC and palmitoylation sites in Arc raises the possibility that phosphorylation suppresses the direct interaction of Arc with its membrane-associated palmitoyltransferase(s).</p><p>A puzzle concerning Arc regulation of synaptic plasticity is its ability to drive both LTP and LTD, as well as the more recently discovered activity of intercellular mRNA transport in secreted virus-like particles. It seems likely that mechanisms underlying the switching of Arc between one activity and another involve changes in its post-translational modifications and macromolecular interactions. For example, Bramham's group has shown that SUMOylated Arc interacts with the actin regulatory protein drebrin, which has been implicated in LTP, whereas non-SUMOylated Arc interacts with elements of the AMPA receptor endocytic machinery, which contributes to LTD <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Our data suggest that PKC phosphorylation of Arc may inhibit some aspects of synaptic depression by suppression of its palmitoylation, as well as intercellular communication by suppression of its mRNA binding and destabilization of capsid-like Arc oligomers. In this context, it is important to note that CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation of Ser260 within the Arc Gag-like domain inhibits metabotropic receptor-dependent LTD, and that a phosphomimetic S260D mutation inhibits the formation of high-order Arc oligomers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</p></div>

[22]</ref>. Briefly, HeLa cells transfected with Flag-tagged Arc, WT, or mutants, were solubilized with 2.5% SDS in 100 mM HEPES (7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail, and 50 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Lysates were incubated at 40 • C for 0.5 h (to reduce potential S-S bonds) and then for an additional 4 h with methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) to block free thiols. Excess MMTS was removed by protein precipitation and washing with acetone. Dried pellets were re-solubilized in 1% SDS and mixed with thiopropyl-Sepharose resin in the presence of either hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) to cleave thioester bonds or 2 M NaCl as a control for false positives. Proteins with free thiols (i.e., from cysteines that were originally palmitoylated before NH 2 OH treatment) were captured on the resin. After extensive washing, proteins released from the resin were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting with anti-Flag antibody in the LiCOR Odyssey system.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We report that Arc is phosphorylated in vitro by PKC on serines 84 and 90 within the second α-helix (helix H2) in the N-terminal domain. This modification is likely to impact the cellular functions of Arc, as helix H2 contains critical determinants of Arc self-association, palmitoylation, SUMOylation, and interactions with nucleic acids. Indeed, we found that phosphomimetic mutations (Ser-to Glu) of residues 84 and 90 disrupt Arc palmitoylation, nucleic acid binding, and high-order oligomerization. Future investigations should be directed at monitoring the effects of plasticity-inducing stimuli on PKC phosphorylation of Arc in cultured neurons. To establish the functional significance of our observations, it will be necessary to introduce Arc-containing phosphomimetic (Ser-to-Glu) and phosphoinhibiting (Ser-to-Ala) mutations in neurons from Arc knockout mice.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
