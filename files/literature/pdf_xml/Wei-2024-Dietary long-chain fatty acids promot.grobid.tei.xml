<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Western diet, characterized by its high content of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), is widely recognized as a significant triggering factor for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While the link between a high-fat diet and colitis has been observed, the specific effects and mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Our study provides evidence that the diet rich in LCFAs can disrupt the integrity of the intestinal barrier and exacerbate experimental colitis in mice. Mechanistically, LCFAs upregulate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) pathway in the inflammatory model, and STAT3 knockout effectively counters the pro-inflammatory effects of LCFAs on colitis. Specifically, palmitic acid (PA), a representative LCFA, enters intestinal epithelial cells via the cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) pathway and participates in the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3. Inhibiting this cycle using pharmacological inhibitors like 2-Bromopalmitate (2-BP) and ML349, as well as DHHC7 knockdown, has the ability to alleviate inflammation induced by PA. These findings highlight the significant role of dietary LCFAs, especially PA, in the development and progression of IBD. Diet adjustments and targeted modulation offer potential therapeutic strategies for managing this condition.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), comprising Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a complex idiopathic intestinal inflammatory condition that primarily affects the ileum, colon, and rectum. Its pathogenesis involves a combination of genetic, environmental, intestinal barrier, and immune response factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Previous investigations have indicated that the adoption of a Westernized diet increases susceptibility to IBD. Western diets are characterized by an elevated intake of simple carbohydrates and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), alongside reduced fiber consumption. LCFAs constitute 95% of triglycerides in these diets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Highfat diets (HFD) have been implicated in the exacerbation of colitis by promoting oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and by perturbing mucosal dendritic cell homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, the specific mechanisms underlying these effects require further elucidation.</p><p>LCFAs typically refer to fatty acids (FAs) with 16 or more carbon atoms and can be categorized as saturated or unsaturated based on the presence of double bonds in the carbon chain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Palmitic acid (PA C16:0) and stearic acid (SA C18:0) are common saturated LCFAs found abundantly in various foods, such as palm oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter, dairy products, and meat <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. PA, as the most prevalent saturated FA in the human body, plays vital roles in cellular membrane composition, secretory lipid production, and transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Recent research has increasingly links the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) pathway to IBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, with the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway consistently recognized as a noteworthy factor in colitis development <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Earlier research suggests that STAT3 can undergo S-palmitoylation through DHHC7 catalysis, and acyl-protein thioesterase-2 (APT2; also known as lysophospholipase 2, LYPLA2) is primarily responsible for depalmitoylation, forming what is known as the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3. This palmitoylation cycle of STAT3 is thought to play a notable role in the initiation and progression of colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a multifunctional membrane glycoprotein, functions as an FA transporter, facilitating the cellular uptake of LCFAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Previous studies have indicated that FAs or HFD can promote CD36 transcription and upregulation of its functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Knockdown of CD36 in mice and cells has been shown to reduce HFD and FA-induced fatty liver, insulin resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and cancer metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. However, there is currently a lack of evidence regarding the role of CD36 in IBD.</p><p>Our investigation has indicated that dietary LCFAs can enter intestinal epithelial cells via CD36-mediated uptake and endocytosis, thereby participating in the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3 and exacerbating colonic inflammation, which plays a notable role in the development of UC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>FFAs, especially LCFAs, are upregulated in the serum of patients with UC This study included 178 discharged patients with a confirmed diagnosis of UC and 178 individuals who had been receiving other health examinations as the control group. Baseline characteristics showed no statistically significant differences in sex distribution and age between the UC and control groups (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). However, the UC group exhibited higher levels of serum-free fatty acids (FFAs) compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</p><p>Among the UC patients, those in remission (n = 36) had lower serum FFA levels compared to those in the mild (n = 52) (P = 0.0108), moderate (n = 42) (P = 0.0063), and severe (n = 48) (P = 0.0005) active phases. No significant differences in FFA levels were observed among varying degrees of activity within the active phase (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). FFA showed potential as a biomarker for distinguishing UC patients from healthy controls (AUC = 0.708) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), and for discriminating between remission and active phases (AUC = 0.720) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>) based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis.</p><p>For further analysis, 10 cases from both the UC and control groups were collected for Targeted Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector/Mass Spectrometry (GC-FID/MS) analysis. The UC group had higher total serum FFA levels than the control group (P = 0.0015) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). Overall, the levels of FAs were more abundant in the UC group compared to the healthy control group, particularly the elevated levels of LCFAs with carbon chain lengths of 16, 18, and 22, as shown in the heatmap (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>).</p><p>The concentrations of various FAs were analyzed (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) and depicted using histograms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>). Among the 28 detectable FAs, C16:0, C18:0, C18:2n6c, and C18:1n9C were the most abundant, and statistically significant differences were observed in their concentrations between the UC and control groups. Notably, the most prominent disparities were found for C16:0 (P = 0.0003) and C18:0 (P = 0.0004), corresponding to PA and SA, respectively.</p><p>In summary, our investigation underscores a substantial upregulation of FFAs, especially LCFAs, in the serum of UC patients, particularly those in the active phase. PA and SA demonstrated the most profound disparities in abundance.</p><p>A high-LCFA diet exacerbates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)induced colitis of wild-type (WT) mice The pro-inflammatory potency of a high-LCFA diet was evaluated in the DSS-induced colitis model (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Our study revealed that mice treated with the high PA diet (HPAD) or the high SA diet (HSAD) exhibited more pronounced weight loss (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), a higher Disease Activity Index (DAI) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), reduced colon length (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>), and increased histological scores (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>) compared to mice treated with normal diet (ND) in the colitis model. Mice administered HPAD or HSAD displayed severe colon inflammation, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, epithelial defects, and crypt atrophy (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>). Furthermore, administration of HPAD or HSAD alone had minimal effects on the mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B-F</ref>).</p><p>We measured the serum FFA levels of mice and observed that they were elevated only in the colitis mouse models, and the increase in HPAD or HSAD-treated mice was more significant compared to ND-treated mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>). Spearman's correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between serum FFA levels and both the histological scores (r = 0.619, P = 0.0061) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>) and the DAI (r = 0.5996, P = 0.0085) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>) of the mice on the final day of the experiment.</p><p>In summary, a high-LCFA diet exacerbates DSS-induced colitis in WT mice, as evidenced by increased inflammation and severity of colitis symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dietary LCFAs exacerbate intestinal barrier damage in DSSinduced colitis mice</head><p>To explore the impact of LCFAs on IBD severity in pathogenesis, we utilized fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (FITCdextran) to assess intestinal barrier permeability in mice. The results revealed that both HPAD and HSAD exacerbated the absorption of FITC-Dextran in the liver and spleen of mice with DSS-induced colitis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Additionally, these diets increased the concentration of FITC-Dextran in the plasma four hours after gavage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), indicating that LCFAs in the diet heightened intestinal permeability under pathological conditions.</p><p>Then we examined inflammatory cytokines and intestinal barrier markers in mouse intestines. In the colitis mice, the expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in the colon tissue was significantly increased after treatment with HPAD or HSAD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>).</p><p>The expression of zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) was downregulated in the inflammation groups and further decreased in mice treated with HPAD and HSAD compared to the ND group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>). Electron microscopy of the colonic epithelium showed that a high-LCFA diet aggravated changes in tight junction integrity in colitis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>). Additionally, the number of colonic epithelial goblet cells was reduced, and the production of mucus and the expression of mucin 2 (MUC-2) protein were inhibited in colitis mice treated with HPAD and HSAD. (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>).</p><p>Apoptosis plays a role in causing dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and triggering inflammatory responses in DSSinduced colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Both HPAD and HSAD treatment significantly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in colitis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H,</ref><ref type="figure">I</ref>). Meanwhile, Western blotting indicated suppressed expression of ZO-1, occludin and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, along with increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3J</ref>). Notably, no statistical differences were observed between control groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A-J</ref>).</p><p>We observed a consistent trend in the expression of IL-6, ZO-1, occludin, Bcl-2, and Bax in the in vitro experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3K-M</ref>).</p><p>In conclusion, these results indicated that LCFAs exacerbate intestinal barrier damage in mice with DSS-induced colitis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dietary LCFAs upregulated the phosphorylation of STAT3</head><p>Previous studies have revealed that PA can trigger STAT3 phosphorylation and exert biological effects in gastric cancer and prostate cancer models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. In our study, we found that LCFAs increased IL-6 levels in the inflammatory model, prompting us to further explore the impact of LCFAs on the IL-6/STAT3 pathway in UC. Our findings revealed an upregulation of p-STAT3 Y705 expression in UC patients compared to the healthy control group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>In mice, Western blotting revealed that administration of HPAD or HSAD in colitis-induced mice led to an increase in p-STAT3 Y705 expression, while the total STAT3 level remained unchanged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses further validated these findings, showing increased p-STAT3 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>). These results led to the hypothesis that LCFAs exacerbate DSS-induced colitis by activating STAT3 phosphorylation. In vitro investigations also yielded consistent outcomes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we evaluated the levels of STAT3 and p-STAT3 in nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Upon PA treatment in the LPSinduced inflammation model, we observed an upregulation of p-STAT3 expression primarily in nuclear proteins, while total STAT3 expression was upregulated in nuclear proteins but downregulated in cytosol proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G</ref>). IF analysis supported these findings (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H</ref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results highlight that LCFAs aggravate colitis by enhancing STAT3 phosphorylation and its translocation into the nucleus. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suppression of STAT3 alleviates LCFA-induced exacerbated inflammation and intestinal barrier damage in experimental colitis</head><p>In the subsequent phase of our investigation, we focused on the role of STAT3 signaling in exacerbating experimental colitis due to LCFA exposure (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). Our findings revealed that STAT3 ΔIEC mice exhibited milder colitis symptoms, such as reduced body weight (Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>), elevated DAI (Fig. <ref type="figure">5C</ref>), and shortened colon length (Fig. <ref type="figure">5D</ref>), compared to STAT3 fl/fl mice. Interestingly, these manifestations in STAT3 ΔIEC mice subjected to different dietary treatments displayed no significant differences, indicating that the absence of STAT3 in intestinal epithelial cells mitigated the detrimental effects of LCFAs on colitis development.</p><p>In addition, STAT3 knockout ameliorated various histological changes caused by the high-LCFA diet in colitis. This was evident from improvements observed in hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining (Fig. <ref type="figure">5E</ref>), pathological scoring (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>), AB-PAS staining, MUC-2 IHC staining (Fig. <ref type="figure">5F</ref>), TUNEL staining (Figs. 5G, S1B), and   scanning electron microscopy (Fig. <ref type="figure">5H</ref>). At the same time, STAT3 knockout also reduced the differences in the expression of IL-6, TNFα, and IL-1β (Fig. <ref type="figure">5I</ref>), as well as ZO-1, occludin, BCL-2, and BAX in the colons of mice with colitis induced by different diets (Fig. <ref type="figure">5J-N</ref>).</p><p>In our in vitro experiment, we employed siRNA to knock down STAT3. Our results showed that under LPS-induced inflammation, PA and SA had no evident effect on siSTAT3-transfected cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5O,</ref><ref type="figure">P</ref>).</p><p>In summary, our results indicated that STAT3 knockdown can mitigate the elevation of inflammatory factors and intestinal barrier damage induced by LCFAs in inflammatory models, thereby suggesting the involvement of the STAT3 signaling pathway in the action of LCFAs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dietary LCFAs promote the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3 in colitis</head><p>The palmitoylation of STAT3 plays an important role in promoting its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. In our study, we observed that PA treatment increased the levels of palmitoylated-STAT3 in the LPS-induced inflammation cell model (Fig. <ref type="figure">6A</ref>). APT2 has been identified as a depalmitoylating enzyme for STAT3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, facilitating the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of phosphorylated STAT3. In vivo, we found higher APT2 expression in the inflammatory group compared to the physiological group, as well as in the HPAD-DSS group compared to the ND-DSS group (Fig. <ref type="figure">6B</ref>). Indeed, these findings were also validated in our in vitro experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</p><p>To explore the role of palmitoylation in STAT3 signaling, we treated cells with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-Bromopalmitate (2-BP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and the APT2 inhibitor ML349 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. 2-BP downregulated the level of STAT3 palmitoylation induced by LPS-PA, whereas ML349 upregulated it (Fig. <ref type="figure">6C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>). Both inhibitors, 2-BP and ML349, reduced the effects of PA on APT2, p-STAT3, ZO-1, occludin, BCL-2, and BAX expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6E-G, S3A</ref>). DHHC7 is the primary palmitoyltransferase of STAT3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Regarding the knockdown of DHHC7, we observed results that were consistent with the use of 2-BP and ML349 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6H,</ref><ref type="figure">I,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3B</ref>).</p><p>In in vivo experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure">6J</ref>), 2-BP improved weight loss, reduced colon length shortening, and alleviated inflammation in colon tissue of mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">6K-M</ref>). Moreover, 2-BP ameliorated the DAI and histopathological scores, while reducing IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels in the mouse colon (Fig. <ref type="figure">6N-P</ref>). The colonic tissue of mice treated with 2-BP showed lower levels of APT2 and p-STAT3 compared to the control group (Fig. <ref type="figure">6Q,</ref><ref type="figure">R,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref>). Additionally, 2-BP alleviated the exacerbated intestinal mucosal barrier damage induced by HPAD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4B,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4C</ref>).</p><p>In addition, our results revealed that the mutation of the STAT3 C108 site resulted in a considerable decrease in the level of palmitoylated-STAT3 in the inflammatory state. On the other hand, the mutation of the Y705 site led to a decrease, but it was relatively less significant compared to the C108 mutation. (Fig. <ref type="figure">6X</ref>). Both mutations at the C108 and Y705 sites reduced the levels of p-STAT3 in the LPS-PA model, while also improving the integrity of the intestinal barrier and reducing the apoptotic indices (Fig. <ref type="figure">6Y</ref>).</p><p>These results collectively indicated that LCFAs are involved in the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3, thereby promoting experimental colitis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dietary LCFAs exacerbate colitis by regulating STAT3 palmitoylation through CD36-mediated endocytosis</head><p>Next, we explored how dietary LCFAs are involved in the regulation of the intracellular STAT3 pathway. CD36 acted as an LCFA transporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, while the G-protein coupled receptors, GRP120 and GRP40, bound to LCFAs, triggered diverse biological responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. BODIPY staining revealed that PA upregulated the fluorescence intensity of cytoplasmic BODIPY (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref>). Subsequently, we pre-treated the LPS-PA model with the CD36 inhibitor (sulfosuccinimidyl oleate sodium, SSO), GPR40 inhibitor (DC260126), and GPR120 inhibitor (AH-7614). Western blotting showed that only SSO hindered the increase of p-STAT and BAX induced by PA, along with the decrease in ZO-1, occludin, and BCL-2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B,</ref><ref type="figure">S5A</ref>). Subsequently, we observed a considerable decrease in BODIPY fluorescence intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure">7C</ref>) and FA uptake in cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">7D</ref>) in the SSO group compared to the DMSO group, while no notable changes were observed in the DC260126 and AH-7614 groups. These findings suggested that PA may primarily exacerbate LPS-induced inflammation through CD36 rather than GPR40 and GPR120. The impact of SSO on the abovementioned proteins in the presence of LPS alone showed no significant difference compared to the control group, indicating that SSO may primarily exert its effects by inhibiting PA (Fig. <ref type="figure">7E</ref>). Cells with siRNA-mediated CD36 knockdown exhibited similar results to SSO intervention (Fig. <ref type="figure">7F</ref>).</p><p>Simultaneously, we found that CD36 expression was upregulated in UC patients compared to healthy controls (Fig. <ref type="figure">7G</ref>). Similarly, CD36 expression was elevated in the HPAD-DSS group compared to the ND-DSS group (Fig. <ref type="figure">7H</ref>). These findings suggested that LCFAs may also directly correlate to CD36 expression levels.</p><p>Moreover, we explored the involvement of VAVS and JNK in CD36-mediated endocytosis of FAs in adipocytes, as previously documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Inhibition of both VAVs (AZA) and JNK (SP600125) led to a decrease in cytoplasmic BODIPY fluorescence intensity (Fig. <ref type="figure">7I</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The global incidence and prevalence of IBD have shown a concerning and continuous increase <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. It is imperative to gain mechanistic insights into IBD to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. Previous investigations have identified a Western diet as a risk factor for IBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. This diet is characterized by its high content of saturated LCFAs, refined sugars, salt, and artificial sweeteners <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Earlier research has demonstrated that an HFD can promote experimental colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. However, the precise underlying mechanisms are still under investigation. In this study, we demonstrated an increased presence of LCFAs, particularly PA and SA, in the serum of UC patients. We further validated and elucidated their detrimental effects in promoting colonic inflammation in mice. Our findings indicated that LCFAs can enhance colonic inflammation by upregulating inflammatory factors, disrupting intestinal barrier integrity, and promoting intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, thereby exacerbating DSSinduced experimental colitis.</p><p>The involvement and mechanisms of STAT3 in the occurrence and progression of IBD have been increasingly elucidated <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. The activation of the IL-6/STAT3 pathway has consistently been identified as a substantial component in colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Previous studies have revealed that PA can trigger STAT3 phosphorylation and exert biological effects in gastric cancer and prostate cancer models <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Consistent with these findings, our results demonstrated that LCFAs upregulate the expression of p-STAT3 in the colitis model and promote the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT3. In STAT3 ΔIEC mice, the impact of LCFAs was found to be impeded by STAT3 deletion. Thus, our findings substantiate the hypothesis that LCFAs exacerbate colitis through the activation of the STAT3 pathway.</p><p>Protein S-acylation, specifically palmitoylation, is the fully reversible post-translational modification that regulates the characteristics and functions of various proteins. PA plays a consequential role in protein palmitoylation by conversion to palmitoyl-CoA, and serves as a substrate for protein S-acylation catalyzed by the DHHC family <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Cys108 of STAT3 is palmitoylated by DHHC7, anchoring to the cell membrane, and selective depalmitoylation of p-STAT3 by APT2 promotes the nuclear translocation of p-STAT3. This process is known as the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3 and has been shown to enhance Th17 differentiation and exacerbate colitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In our study, we demonstrated that PA upregulated the levels of palmitoylated STAT3 in LPS-induced inflammation models. APT2, an acyl protein thioesterase mainly present in cells, removes PA from cysteine residues of proteins and plays a substantial role in maintaining the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. We found that PA upregulated the levels of APT2 in inflamed colonic tissues and cells, providing evidence for the direct or indirect involvement of dietary-derived PA in the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3.</p><p>Our results showed that the broad-spectrum palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP downregulated palmitoylated STAT3 in colitis cell models, while the selective APT2 inhibitor ML349 upregulated palmitoylated STAT3. Interestingly, both 2-BP and ML349, as well as knockdown of DHHC7, blocked the inflammatory upregulation induced by PA in in vitro experiments. This suggests that disrupting the normal operation of the palmitoylated STAT3 cycle can inhibit the pro-inflammatory effects of PA. These results also indicated that the palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycle, rather than just palmitoylation alone, plays an important role in PAmediated exacerbation of colitis. We obtained similar findings in in vivo experiments using 2-BP intervention.</p><p>The DHHC7-mediated palmitoylation of STAT3 at the Cys108 site promoted the membrane recruitment of STAT3 and phosphorylation at the Y705 site, while APT2 selectively depalmitoylated p-STAT3 and facilitated its nuclear translocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Our conclusion aligns with previous studies, suggesting that PA-LPSinduced palmitoylation of STAT3 can influence the phosphorylation level of STAT3. Importantly, phosphorylation of STAT3 is not a necessary condition for its palmitoylation, indicating that palmitoylation of STAT3 serves as an important upstream mechanism for STAT3 phosphorylation.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that LCFAs can enter cells through FA transporters, such as CD36 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, or exert various biological responses by binding to free LCFA receptors, such as the G protein-coupled receptors GRP120 and GRP40, on the cell membrane surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Our results revealed an upregulation of CD36 levels in colonic tissues of UC patients, and a high-LCFA diet increased CD36 expression in the colonic tissues of mice with colitis. In our in vivo experiments, we found that PA may exert its effects by being transported into cells via CD36, rather than by binding to GRP120 and GRP40 directly. The anti-inflammatory action of SSO is based on inhibition of PA uptake. In our in vivo experiments, both concentrations of SSO (10 mg kg -1 and 25 mg kg -1 ) effectively inhibited the promotional effect of HPAD on colitis. Additionally, pretreatment with inhibitors of the downstream molecules VAVS and JNK, which mediate CD36 endocytosis, successfully mitigated the promotional effect of PA on the LPS model. Furthermore, the inhibition of CD36 also successfully downregulated the palmitoylation of STAT3 induced by PA.</p><p>A limitation of our study is that we only explored the in-depth mechanisms of PA. PA is the primary lipid involved in the acylation of endogenous proteins. However, SA can also participate as an LCFA moiety in protein S-acylation. Further investigation is needed to determine whether SA enters cells and contributes to protein S-acylation. On the other hand, we observed that PA intervention upregulates the expression levels of APT2 in both in vivo and in vitro experiments. However, the specific regulatory mechanisms by which PA affects APT2 expression remain unclear and warrant further investigation.</p><p>In summary, dietary LCFAs, especially PA, can enter cells through CD36 uptake and participate in the palmitoylation cycle of STAT3, leading to the disruption of the intestinal barrier and exacerbation of colitis. These findings provide potential strategies for the prevention and treatment of IBD.</p></div>

First, 10 μL of the internal standard (C17:0-D33 in acetonitrile, 0.2 mg mL -1 ) and 10 μL of 0.5% formic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in water were added to the samples. The mixture was extracted with 300 μL of ethyl acetate (SCRC, Shanghai, China) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The upper layer was collected, while the bottom layer underwent another extraction with 300 μL of ethyl acetate. The resulting extract was dried and re-dissolved in 50 μL of pyridine (J&amp;K, Beijing, China). Derivatization was performed by adding 50 μL of N, Obis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (Sigma) and incubating the mixture at 60 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was then transferred into a sample vial for subsequent gas chromatography (GC) analysis. A set of 34 fatty acids (Table <ref type="table">S10</ref>) was used as target analytes, procured from Sigma, J&amp;K, and Cayman Chemical (MI, USA). The GC-FID/MS system utilized in this study consisted of an Agilent 7890B gas chromatography instrument coupled to an Agilent 5977B mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, USA).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IHC and IF</head><p>IHC staining was performed using an IHC Kit (#36312ES50, YEASEN, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For IF, nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 15% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature prior to incubation with primary antibodies and diluted in 2% goat serum overnight at 4 °C. Fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the slides were sealed with anti-fluorescence quenching sealing solution containing DAPI (#36308ES11, YEASEN) and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, The primary antibodies used were as follows: ZO-1 (#ab221547, Abcam), STAT3 (#79D7, CST), P-STAT3 (#D3A7, CST), MUC-2 (#ab272692, Abcam), LYPLA2 (#sc-515061, Santa Cruz, CA,USA), CD36 (#ab252922, Abcam), CD36 (#ab252923, Abcam), CoraLite594-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) (#SA00013-4, Proteintech), and CoraLite488conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) (#SA00013-2, Proteintech).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Electron microscopy (EM)</head><p>Fresh 1 mm long segments of the distal mouse colon tissue were fixed in EM fixative (#G1102, Servicebio) at 4 °C for 24 h, washed three times with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB PH7.4), and then post-fixed with 1% osmic acid (#18456, Ted Pella Inc, USA) in 0.1 M PB for 2 h at room temperature, protected from light. Following ethanol dehydration, the specimens were embedded in 812 embedding agent (# 90529-77-4, SPI, Shanxi, China) and then sectioned extra thinly and processed for EM following the standard procedure. Finally, samples were visualized and photographed using an HT7800 transmission electron microscope (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluation of intestinal barrier integrity in WT mouse model</head><p>Prior to oral administration, mice were subjected to fasting in the morning for four hours before gavage. For each mouse, a fresh solution containing 80 mg mL -1 of 4 kDa FITC-dextran (#CSN36366, CSNpharm, Shanghai, China) in sterile PBS was immediately prepared, taking precautions to avoid exposure to light. The administration of FITC-dextran was carried out orally by gavage at a dose of 0.8 mg g -1 body weight. One hour post-gavage, mouse abdominal fur was removed using an electric razor, and images of the abdominal area were captured using the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS Lumina II, Caliper Life Science, USA) with a laser set at 470 nm and a resolution of 2.0 mm for in vivo fluorescence assessment. Four hours post-gavage, plasma samples were collected, and fluorescence intensity was measured using a Victor Nivo microplate reader (PerkinElmer, USA) (λ ex = 485/λ em = 530 nm).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TUNEL and AB-PAS</head><p>Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were sectioned into 3 um thin slices. The TUNEL of apoptotic cells in mouse colon tissue was detected using a One Step TUNEL Apoptosis Assay Kit (#C1088, Beyotime), following the manufacturer's protocol. TUNEL-positive cells were visualized under fluorescent microscopy to evaluate apoptotic and necrotic morphological alterations. AB-PAS (#G1285, Solarbio, Beijing, China) staining was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ELISA</head><p>The mouse colonic tissues were homogenized in cold PBS with 1% protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was quantified by BCA protein assay (#P0010, Beyotime). The concentrations of IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β in the supernatants were determined using mouse IL-6 ELISA kits (#M6000B R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), mouse TNF-α ELISA kits (#88-7324-88, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and mouse IL-1β ELISA kits (#88-7013-88, Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturer's instructions. IL-6 levels in cell culture supernatants were determined using a human IL-6 ELISA kit (#88-7066-88, Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FA uptake</head><p>To investigate FA uptake in ncm460 cells, a pretreatment step was performed in serum-free medium for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were exposed to SSO (50 μM), AH-7614 (10 μM) (#HY-19996, MCE), DC260126 (10 μM) (#HY-101906, MCE), or DMSO as a control for 1 h. The uptake of fatty acids was assessed using the Fatty Acid Uptake kit (#MAK156, Sigma), following the manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence intensity ((λ ex = 485/ λ em = 515 nm) was measured after a 30-min incubation using a Victor Nivo microplate reader (PerkinElmer, MA, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Determination of FFA contents</head><p>Mouse serum FFA was measured using a Free Fatty Acid Quantitation Kit (#MAK044, Sigma) with standardized protocols and determined via a colorimetric method using a Victor Nivo microplate reader (PerkinElmer) BODIPY Cells were plated in a 12-well plate paved with sterile slips and were given PA (200 μM) and BSA (control) for 24 h. To study the impact of different inhibitors on the cellular FA uptake, cells were preincubated with SSO (50 μM), AH-7614 (10 μM), DC260126 (10 μM), and DMSO (control) for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were stimulated for 24 h with LPS in combination with 200 μM PA. After washing with PBS three times, the cells were stained with 40 μM BODIPY™ FL C 12 (#D3822, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at 37 °C and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and a nuclear stain (DAPI) was performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acyl-biotin exchange (ABE)</head><p>ABE was carried out according to the method described by a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Briefly, the cell samples were lysed with 1 mL lysis buffer A for 30 min on ice and sonicated for 1 min. Following centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatants were collected for protein quantification using the BCA method. Proteins (10 μg) were precipitated three times with methanol/chloroform/water (v/v 1:4:3) and redissolved by adding 300 μL 4SB solution containing 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (#N808610, Macklin Biochemical Technology Shanghai, China) for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were incubated with lysis buffer B overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were precipitated with methanol/chloroform/water three times again, then redissolved in 4SB solution. The solution was divided into two portions, which were supplemented further with +/-NH 2 OH buffer, and incubated for 1 h in RT. After protein precipitation, the samples were redissolved in 4SB and incubated with low HPDP-Biotin buffer (#B871617, Macklin Biochemical Technology) for 1 h in RT. Then, the proteins were dissolved with lysis buffer C for 30 min at RT and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C with avidinconjugated magnetic beads (#88816, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After washing three times with buffer, the samples were mixed with SDS-PAGE reducing buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min for use for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Details of all formulations are shown in Table <ref type="table">S11</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analyses</head><p>Statistical analyses and graph generation were performed using GraphPad Prism 8, except for the ROC analysis, which was conducted using SPSS27. Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and homogeneity of variances was tested using Levene's test. A Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test was employed to compare two variables, while analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparing three or more variables. Spearman's correlation analyses were performed for correlation analysis in this study. P &lt; 0.05 was designated as significant.</p></div>
