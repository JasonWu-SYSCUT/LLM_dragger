			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abnormal inflammation of vascular endothelial cells occurs frequently in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B) is a lipid raft enzyme and plays an anti-inflammatory role in various diseases but its function in DR-related vascular endothelial dysfunction remains unknown. We first found that SMPDL3B expression was upregulated from week 10 to 18 in the retinal tissues of db/db mice. Particularly, the high expression of SMPDL3B was mainly observed in retinal vascular endothelium of DR mice. To interfere retinal SMPDL3B expression, adeno-associated viruses 2 (AAV-2) containing SMPDL3B specific shRNA (1233-1253 bp) were injected into the vitreous cavity of db/db mice. SMPDL3B silencing exacerbated the spontaneous DR by further activating the NF-κB/NLRP3 pro-inflammatory pathway. In vitro, human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRVECs) were infected with SMPDL3B-shRNA lentiviruses and then stimulated with 30 mM glucose (HG) for 24 h. SMPDL3B-silenced HRVECs secreted more interleukin-1β and had enhanced nuclear p65 translocation. Notably, HG treatment induced the palmitoylation of SMPDL3B. Zinc finger DHHCtype palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5) is a palmitoyltransferase that catalyzes the palmitoylation of its substrates, HG exposure increased the interaction between ZDHHC5 and SMPDL3B in HRVECs. 2-BP, a palmitoylation inhibitor, accelerated the protein degradation of SMPDL3B, whereas palmostatin B, a depalmitoylation inhibitor, decreased its turnover rate in HRVECs. Collectively, the present study suggests a compensatory increase of SMPDL3B in HG-treated HRVECs and the retinal tissues of DR mice, indicating that SMPDL3B may be a potential target for DR treatment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common microvascular disease of all diabetes-related microvascular complications, which result in severe visual impairment and blindness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. DR is mainly divided into non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR). NPDR is the early stage of DR, where insufficient perfusion leads to chronic vascular inflammation of retinal capillaries (mainly manifested as leukocyte infiltration) and irreversible hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The presence of this capillary inflammation can also cause a breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and vascular leakage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. NPDR further develops into PDR, which is associated with an increased risk of vision loss due to neovascularization and eventually traction retinal detachment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Retinal endothelial cell injury is a key participant in the early development of NPDR. Retinal endothelial cells, which line the dendritic microvascular system that supplies and drains the neuroretina, are crucial for the nutritional supply and visual maintenance of the retina <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Endothelial cells not only supply oxygen and other nutrients to the metabolically active retina but also help protect the BRB by eliminating circulating molecular toxins and pro-inflammatory leukocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Endothelial cell damage is the main reason of retinal vascular leakage and neovascularization, as well as the transportation of microorganisms and inflammatory cells. Therefore, the alteration of retinal endothelium plays a very important role in the occurrence of retinal diseases and is one of the markers of DR. Exploring the mechanism of retinal endothelial injury induced by diabetes is of great significance for DR treatment.</p><p>Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3B (SMPDL3B) is a lipid raft enzyme that regulates plasma membrane fluidity. Studies have shown that after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, mice with SMPDL3B deficiency exhibit more interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) release than the wild type mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Taesik et al. have also reported that overexpression of SMPDL3B reduces the expression and secretion of interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and TNF-α in thrombospondin 1-treated macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. These findings suggest the anti-inflammatory potential of SMPDL3B. By analyzing the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE28831) analysis results, we found a significantly increase in SMPDL3B expression in the retinal tissues of DR rats, which indicates that SMPDL3B may be involved in the process of DR but currently the function of SMPDL3B in DR is unknown. Additionally, macrophages with SMPDL3B deletion showed sustained degradation of IkappaBalpha (IκBα), indicating a negative regulation between SMPDL3B and the NF-κB signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. The NF-κB signaling is over-activated in retinal endothelial cell injury induced by high glucose and in retinal tissues of the DR model, and inhibition of this pathway alleviates the endothelial injury of DR <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. We thus speculated that SMPDL3B might participate in the process of DR by regulating the NF-κB signaling pathway.</p><p>Palmitoylation (or S-palmitoylation) refers to the reversible chemical connection between palmitate molecules and cysteine residues. This reversible post-translational modification can alter the localization, stability, and function of proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It has been reported that protein palmitoylation changes exist in vascular complications of diabetes, and high glucose stimulation cause increased palmitoylation of R-Ras protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5) is one of the palmitoyltransferases that mediate the binding of palmitate to cysteine residues on substrates. For example, ZDHHC5 has been indicated to mediate nucleoside binding oligomerization domain protein 2 (NOD2) palmitoylation modification and increase the protein stability of NOD2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Herein, we found that ZDHHC5 bound to SMPDL3B at the protein level, which was analyzed by the HitPredict website (http:// www.hitpredict.org/). We thus hypothesized that the dysregulation of SMPDL3B expression in DR process might involve palmitoylation modification. Overall, this study mainly focused on the role and mechanism of SMPDL3B in DR-induced endothelial injury in order to provide a new direction for the treatment of DR.</p></div>

The db/ db mice with C57BLKS/J background, weighted 38-44 g, were genetically diabetic leptin receptor-mutated mice characterized by spontaneous obesity and hyperglycemia and were used as the DR model. The wide-type C57BLKS/J mice (db/m mice, 20-22 g) were used as the control. All mice were maintained at 22 ± 1 • C with a 12 h light/dark cycle and 45-55% humidity. These mice were raised until 8, 14, and 18 weeks old, respectively, and eyeball tissues were taken and stored for subsequent testing. Blood glucose levels were measured and mice were considered diabetic when the blood glucose levels were 13.9 mmoL/L or higher for two consecutive days. The timeline of the experimental protocol was shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1A</ref>.</p><p>Group 2: Control (db/m mice), DR (db/db mice), DR + AAV2-mNC sh , and DR + AAV2-mSMPDL3B sh groups were divided. Due to diabetes onset around 10 weeks of age <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, thus mice aged 10 weeks were used for gene intervention. For DR + AAV2-mNC sh and DR + AAV2-mSMPDL3B sh groups, db/db mice were injected with either AAV2 solution (1 μL each eye, 2 × 10 9 vg) or PBS into the vitreous cavity of both eyes. Eight weeks later, eyeball tissues were taken and stored for subsequent testing. The timeline of the experimental protocol was shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1B</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">The expression of SMPDL3B was upregulated in the retina tissues of DR mice</head><p>To detect SMPDL3B expression in the retinal tissues of DR, retinal tissues from db/db mice aged 10, 14, and 18 weeks were collected. The mRNA and protein expression of SMPDL3B in retinal tissues was increased with the age of db/db mice compared with age-matched nondiabetic control, and peaked at week 18 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). We thus chose db/db mice at 18 weeks for subsequent study. Results of H&amp;E staining showed that retinal thickness was decreased and the number of retinal ganglion cells was reduced (marked with black arrows) in the db/db mice aged 18 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). These pathological changes indicated that db/db mice aged 18 weeks have already developed retinopathy (DR mice). We further determined the expression and distribution of SMPDL3B in retinal tissues of DR mice by performing IHC staining, and the results showed the strong immunoreactivities of SMPDL3B in ganglion cell layer (GCL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), and inner nuclear layer (INL), while the expression of SMPDL3B in NC group showed little brown immunostaining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). As presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>, the yellow fluorescence in the image represents the co-localization staining. The yellow fluorescence of GCL (marked with white arrows) in DR group was enhanced compared with the control group, indicating that the colocalization of SMPDL3B and CD31 (endothelial marker) in vessel walls in GCL was increased in DR mice compared with age-matched control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>). The results suggest that SMPDL3B may regulate the dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells during DR progression.</p></div>

Results of RT-qPCR and western blot assays indicated that SMPDL3B mRNA and protein expression in the DR retinal tissues were successfully knocked down by AAV2 infection (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>). After SMPDL3B expression was knocked down in DR mice, retinal became thinner and fewer retinal ganglion cells were observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>). Moreover, the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory factors, IL-6, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), measured by RT-qPCR, were increased markedly in retinal tissues of DR mice, and this increase was enhanced by SMPDL3B down-regulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C</ref>). </p></div>

The effects of SMPDL3B on the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome was measured by western blot in which NLRP3 and cleaved caspase 1 protein levels were increased in retinal tissues of DR mice and their levels were further increased by SMPDL3B knockdown (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>). The IL-1β level was found to be increased in DR group, and SMPDL3B knockdown further increased IL-1β concentration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>). Meanwhile, SMPDL3B knockdown also increased NLRP3 expression in retinal tissues measured by NLRP3 immunofluorescence staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>).

It was shown that the IκBα (inhibitor of NF-κB pathway) protein level was decreased in DR mice, whereas its phosphorylation level at the Ser32 site was increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>). SMPDL3B silencing further decreased IκBα expression but increased its phosphorylation level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>). The phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 was significantly increased in DR mice, which was further elevated by SMPDL3B knockdown (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>). The phosphorylation of p65 in retinal tissues was also measured by p-p65 immunofluorescence staining and the changes in phosphorylation of p65 were consistent with those in retinal tissues measured by western blot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>). Overall, those results suggest that the impact of SMPDL3B on the progression of DR involves the regulation of the NF-κB pathway in retinal tissues. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">HG exposure induced SMPDL3B expression and SMPDL3B knockdown enhanced HG-induced activation of the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway in HRVECs</head><p>The function of SMPDL3B in DR was also explored by in vitro experiments. HG treatment significantly upregulated SMPDL3B expression in HRVECs at both RNA and protein levels (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A-B</ref>). To further verify the function of SMPDL3B in vitro, HRVECs were infected with lentiviruscarried shRNA specifically targeting SMPDL3B to achieve SMPDL3B silencing in HRVECs. The downregulation of SMPDL3B mRNA and protein levels in HG-treated HRVECs were verified by western blot and RT-qPCR, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">5C</ref>). HG stimulation induced NLRP3 expression at both RNA and protein levels, increased cleaved caspase 1 protein expression, and promoted the secretion of IL-1β in HRVECs, whereas SMPDL3B knockdown enhanced those changes (Fig. <ref type="figure">5D-E</ref>). Moreover, JSH-23 (a NF-κB inhibitor) treatment reversed the effects of SMPDL3B silencing on the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fig. <ref type="figure">5F-G</ref>). Furthermore, the function of SMPDL3B in regulating the NF-κB pathway was explored. It was shown that the p65 protein level in the cytoplasm was reduced but in the nucleus was increased under HG condition, SMPDL3B silencing enhanced those changes (Fig. <ref type="figure">6A</ref>). Nuclear transfer of p65 was measured by IF staining, in which SMPDL3B knockdown promoted HGinduced nuclear accumulation of p65 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6B</ref>). The results demonstrate that SMPDL3B negatively regulate the activation of NF-κB pathway. Collectively, the data suggest that SMPDL3B knockdown accelerates HGinduced inflammation via activating NLRP3 inflammasome by activating the NF-κB pathway.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">ZDHHC5-mediated palmitoylation modification upregulated SMPDL3B expression</head><p>The SwissPalm website (https://swisspalm.org/) analyzed that SMPDL3B was suggested to be potentially palmitoylated in numerous palmitoyl-protein proteomics. Moreover, ZDHHC5, the palmitoyltransferase responsible for palmitoylation, was predicted to bind to SMPDL3B at the protein level by the HitPredict website (http://www. hitpredict.org/). We thus investigated whether palmitoylation is involved in the dysregulation of SMPDL3B expression in DR. Our results  showed that SMPDL3B could be palmitoylated and its palmitoylation was increased in retinal tissues and HRVECs under DR environment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A-B</ref>). After blocking palmitoylation by using 2-BP, a palmitoylation inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, SMPDL3B protein exhibited a faster turnover rate in HRVECs treated with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, 100 μg/mL) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>). Conversely, depalmitoylation inhibitors palmostatin B (Palm B, 2.5 μM) treatment decreased the degradation of SMPDL3B protein in HRVECs treated with CHX (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>). Protein interactions between ZDHHC5 and SMPDL3B were also verified by Co-IP assay and HG stimulation increased their binding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7D-E</ref>). Furthermore, as presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A-B</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>, the total SMPDL3B protein levels in DR and HG groups exhibited no significant difference as compared with the corresponding controls, which indicated that there was no significant difference in SMPDL3B protein content pulled down by SMPDL3B antibody between groups, ensuring a single variable. Those observations indicate that SMPDL3B expression may be regulated by ZDHHC5-mediated palmitoylation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>In the in vivo experiment, we first found that the expression of SMPDL3B changed significantly in retinal endothelial cells of DR mice, suggesting that SMPDL3B may be related to retinal endothelial dysfunction in DR. During hyperglycemia, retinal microvascular endothelial cells undergo various intracellular events, including the production of pro-inflammatory factors and chemokines, leading to disruption of BRB, endothelial injury, increased vascular permeability, and pathologic angiogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Therefore, in this study, we mainly investigated the role and mechanism of SMPDL3B in DR-related retinal endothelial injury. Our results suggested that SMPDL3B was significantly overexpressed during DR and the palmitoylation of SMPDL3B mediated by ZDHHC5 might be one of the reasons for the up-regulation of SMPDL3B expression. Moreover, SMPDL3B, as an anti-inflammatory factor, played a protective role in retinal vascular endothelial dysfunction during DR, which was involved in the regulation of the NF-κB/ NLRP3 pathway. In addition, retinal tissue involves a variety of cell types, including vascular endothelial cells, pigment epithelial cells, neurons, and glial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Whether SMPDL3B participates in the process of DR by influencing the physiological processes of other cells is unknown, which provides direction for our next research.</p><p>SMPDL3B expression in macrophages regulated toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling by altering cell membrane fluidity, thus regulating inflammatory responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Inhibition of SMPDL3B expression amplified pro-inflammatory signals in the liver and accelerated the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. In addition, overexpression of SMPDL3B enhanced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) recognition and repair and inhibited podocytes apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These observations demonstrate the protective role of SMPDL3B in various disease processes. Our results indicated that SMPDL3B was highly expressed in the retinal vascular endothelium of DR mice and HGtreated HRVECs cells, suggesting that SMPDL3B may be involved in DR-related retinal vascular endothelial disorders. Knockdown of SMPDL3B accelerated the inflammation of retinal vascular endothelium and aggravated the process of DR, indicating that SMPDL3B plays a protective role in DR, and this protective effect may be realized by inhibiting the inflammatory response of retinal vascular endothelium, which is consistent with the anti-inflammatory effect of SMPDL3B previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In this study, the increased expression of SMPDL3B may be a self-protection mechanism in response to a pathological environment.</p><p>NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-associated commission domain (ASC), and caspase-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. NLRP3 interacts with ASC to activate caspase 1. Once activated, NLRP3 inflammasome induces tissue damage by upregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. NLRP3 inflammasome over-activation has been reported in retinal tissues of DR patients and animal models and has been identified as a pathogenic factor in the pathogenesis of DR <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Targeted inhibitors of NLRP3 have anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects and alleviate the pathology of DR <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Our results suggest that SMPDL3B may alleviate DR-related vascular endothelial inflammation by negatively regulating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, the NF-κB pathway, a typical inflammatory regulatory pathway, has been reported to be over-activated in the DR process, and inhibition of this pathway alleviates vascular endothelial inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. The NF-κB pathway can mediate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The current study also indicates that SMPDL3B alleviate DR-associated vascular endothelial inflammation by negatively regulating the activation of the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway. Previous reports have shown that SMPDL3B is a negative regulator of TLR signaling transduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. TLR signaling pathway is the upstream stimulation signal of NF-κB pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. It is speculated that SMPDL3B may inhibit the activation of NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway by regulating the TLR signaling.</p><p>SMPDL3B is an enzyme belonging to the sphingomyelinase family known to play a critical role in the breakdown of sphingomyelin <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Various sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide (Cer) and S1P, can regulate ocular inflammatory diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The S1P-S1P receptor signaling system plays important roles in maintenance of vascular integrity since it suppresses sprouting angiogenesis and regulates vascular permeability. Dysfunction of the S1P-S1P receptor signaling system results in various vascular defects, such as exaggerated angiogenesis in developing retina and augmented inflammation due to increased permeability <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Previous studies reported that SMPDL3B overexpression significantly increased S1P levels in human podocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The negative regulation of SMPDL3B on diabetes-induced endothelial injury may also be achieved by regulating various sphingolipid metabolites levels, such as S1P.</p><p>Protein palmitoylation is a reversible modification in which a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid (palmitate) is thioesterified to an internal cysteine residue. Proteins can cycle between palmitoylation and depalmitoylation forms <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Dynamic palmitoylation can affect protein localization, accumulation, secretion, stability, and function by altering membrane affinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Protein palmitoylation is mediated by a series of multi-channel transmembrane palmitoyltransferase, which contains the zinc finger domain and the conserved Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC, also known as ZDHHC) motif required for palmitoyltransferase activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The results of this study showed that palmitoylation of SMPDL3B increased the protein stability of SMPDL3B, possibly mediated by ZDHHC5, suggesting that palmitoylation of the protein has a mitigating effect on the progression of DR. In addition, we noted that HG treatment increased the interaction between SMPDL3B and ZDHHC5, which may be due to the effects of HG on SMPDL3B, ZDHHC5 expressions or their subcellular localization. GPS-Palm Software <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> analyzed that sites 45 and 64 were potential cysteine modification sites and their modifications were conserved between species, we thus speculate that the palmitoylation modification of cysteine at these two sites may affect the protein stability of SMPDL3B. Furthermore, ZDHHC5 is just one of factors that regulate the protein stability of SMPDL3B, we did not further explore the function of ZDHHC5 in DR in this study. Meanwhile, palmitoylation has been shown to accelerate DR by mediating glucose-induced Rac1 activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. This indicates that the effect of palmitoylation modification on the progression of DR is double-sided and depends on the function of the specific modified protein. Additionally, under the DR environment, the elevated transcription level of SMPDL3B and the increased protein stability mediated by palmitoylation modification jointly lead to the elevation of SMPDL3B protein.</p><p>This study is the first to reveal the regulatory effect of SMPDL3B on vascular endothelial injury during the DR process. Specifically, SMPDL3B was over-expressed in the retinal vascular endothelium of DR mice and HG-treated HRVECs. SMPDL3B silencing accelerated retinal endothelial inflammation and exacerbated the progression of DR, with potential mechanisms involving regulation of NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway activation. In addition, we found that ZDHHC5-mediated palmitoylation of SMPDL3B may be one of the reasons for the up-regulation of SMPDL3B expression under HG condition. Overall, our results demonstrate that the compensatory upregulation of SMPDL3B may be a potential self-protection mechanism for the retina to avoid vascular endothelial dysfunction, which provides new ideas for the treatment of DR, such as the study of targeted drugs and gene targeting tools.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>( 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>100 dilution, Bioss) overnight at 4 • C or were incubated with rabbitsourced NLRP3 antibody (1:100 dilution; Cat No.DF7438, Affinity, China) or rabbit-sourced p-p65 antibody (Ser536, 1:100 dilution; Cat No.AF2006, Affinity) overnight at 4 • C.
