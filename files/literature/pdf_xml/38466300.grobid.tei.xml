<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Caveolae are small flask-shaped invaginations of the surface membrane which are proposed to recruit and co-localize signaling molecules. The distinctive caveolar shape is achieved by the oligomeric structural protein caveolin, of which three isoforms exist. Aside from the finding that caveolin-3 is specifically expressed in muscle, functional differences between the caveolin isoforms have not been rigorously investigated. Caveolin-3 is relatively cysteine-rich compared to caveolins 1 and 2, so we investigated its cysteine post-translational modifications. We find that caveolin-3 is palmitoylated at 6 cysteines and becomes glutathiolated following redox stress. We map the caveolin-3 palmitoylation sites to a cluster of cysteines in its C terminal membrane domain, and the glutathiolation site to an N terminal cysteine close to the region of caveolin-3 proposed to engage in protein interactions. Glutathiolation abolishes caveolin-3 interaction with heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits. Our results indicate that a caveolin-3 oligomer contains up to 66 palmitates, compared to up to 33 for caveolin-1. The additional palmitoylation sites in caveolin-3 therefore provide a mechanistic basis by which caveolae in smooth and striated muscle can possess unique phospholipid and protein cargoes. These unique adaptations of the muscle-specific caveolin isoform have important implications for caveolar assembly and signaling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p>Caveolae are small, flask-shaped invaginations of the cell surface membrane that recruit and co-localize receptors, G proteins, their effector molecules, and downstream targets to ensure fidelity of signal transduction in numerous tissues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Classically, the predominant structural component of caveolae was thought to be the scaffolding protein caveolin, which recruits both lipids and proteins to assemble the caveolar architecture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Three caveolin isoforms exist: caveolins 1 and 2 are ubiquitous, and caveolin-3 expression is confined only to smooth and striated muscle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> The cryo-EM structure of recombinant caveolin-1 reveals it forms a flat, diskshaped oligomer composed of 11 monomers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In recent years, a second family of obligatory caveolar structural proteins, the cavins, has been identified. Cavins interact directly with and stabilize the caveolin oligomer and like caveolins are obligatory for the formation of caveolae. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Cavin-1 is ubiquitous and indispensable for caveolar formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Cavins 2-4 show more tissue-specific distributions.</p><p>The dynamic association of proteins with caveolae offers an opportunity for regulation of signal transduction, but remarkably few proteins have been found to be recruited into or expelled from caveolae, and the caveolar proteome remains extremely stable during signal transduction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> Post-translational modifications of caveolins and cavins represent one means by which their turnover and protein interactions could be regulated. For example, phosphorylation of caveolin-1 Tyr-14 by Src kinase modifies its interactions with a matrix metalloprotease. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Caveolin-1 Tyr-14 phosphorylation is influenced by Snitrosation of caveolin-1 Cys-156, which releases Src to allow it to phosphorylate caveolin-1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> SUMOylation of caveolin-3 modifies β2but not β1adrenoceptor-dependent signaling, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and ubiquitination at K39 controls caveolin-1 turnover. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> Although there are numerous phosphorylation sites annotated in the cavin isoforms, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> few other posttranslational modifications have been found to regulate the behavior of cavins or caveolins. Caveolin-1 is palmitoylated at 3 cysteine residues close to its carboxyl terminus, but caveolin-1 palmitoylation is irreversible, and not required for caveolin-1 membrane-targeting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Analogous cysteines exist in caveolins 2 and 3 (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), but their palmitoylation has not been rigorously investigated.</p><p>In the present investigation, we characterized cysteine post-translational modifications of caveolin-3, the musclespecific caveolin isoform. Cysteine S-palmitoylation is the reversible covalent post-translational attachment of the 16-carbon fatty acid palmitic acid to the thiol group of cysteine, via an acyl-thioester linkage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> Protein Spalmitoylation is catalyzed by palmitoyl acyltransferases, reversed by protein thioesterases, and dynamically regulates numerous important cellular pathways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> Cysteine S-glutathiolation is the reversible conjugation of the tripeptide glutathione to protein cysteines in a mixed disulfide. Many classes of protein are glutathiolated, leading to dynamic, reversible regulation of signaling and metabolic pathways. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> No longer simply regarded as solely being associated with oxidative stress, glutathiolation can occur by direct reaction between oxidized/modified protein sulfhydryls and cellular glutathione under physiological conditions in the absence of overt oxidative burden. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Most cysteine sulfhydryls are not susceptible to glutathiolation because their pKa is above 8.0, rendering them non-reactive at physiological pH. Redox-sensitive cysteines that are susceptible to glutathiolation may be deprotonated to thiolate anions at physiological pH, which is usually achieved by the presence of positively charged residues nearby to receive the proton. Glutathiolation is reversed enzymatically by glutaredoxins, thioredoxins, and sulfiredoxin and can be removed non-enzymatically by disulfide exchange with glutathione.  Using a novel PEGylation assay in this investigation, we find up to six caveolin-3 cysteines are palmitoylated in cardiac muscle and map these palmitoylation sites in transfected cells. We also find that caveolin-3 is reversibly glutathiolated and that caveolin-3 glutathiolation modifies its interaction with heterotrimeric G proteins during redox stress. Our findings highlight important functional differences between caveolin isoforms and assign unique regulatory functions to caveolae in smooth and striated muscle.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Palmitoylation site mapping in caveolin-3</head><p>Caveolin-1 (which has only 3 cysteines in its sequence, Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) is triply palmitoylated, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> but the palmitoylation stoichiometry of caveolin-3 has not been investigated. By exchanging palmitates for a PEG molecule using the acyl-PEG exchange assay, we investigated the stoichiometry of caveolin-3 palmitoylation in multiple cell types. In this assay, free protein cysteines are first alkylated in the presence of SDS, and then, palmitoylated cysteines are revealed by treating with neutral hydroxylamine to cleave the thioester bond. Reaction with 5 kDa PEG maleimide produces a 5 kDa increase in molecular weight for each thiol group that has been revealed by hydroxylamine, allowing the palmitoylation stoichiometry of a protein to be determined. In both the myoblast cell line H9c2 and adult rat ventricular myocytes we identified multiple palmitoylation sites in caveolin-3: at least 5 sites in H9c2 cells (Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>), and 6 sites in rat ventricular myocytes (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>).</p><p>To identify the palmitoylated cysteines in caveolin-3 we first generated single cysteine to alanine mutations and expressed them in HEK-293 cells, which possess a full repertoire of zDHHC-PATs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> In HEK-293 cells, low levels of expression of endogenous caveolin-1 have previously been observed 32 but caveolin-3 is not expressed at all. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> The acyl PEG exchange assays reveal that wild-type caveolin-3 was significantly less palmitoylated in HEK-293 cells than ventricular muscle (predominant palmitoylated species +1 to +2 palmitates, compared to +4 palmitates in ventricular muscle, Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). This precluded definitive identification of the caveolin-3 palmitoylation sites using this approach. We therefore generated a cys-less caveolin-3, reintroduced individual cysteines to the cys-less protein, and expressed these proteins in HEK-293 cells. Resin-assisted capture purifies palmitoylated proteins regardless of how many palmitoylation sites are occupied, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> so is a suitable approach to assess the palmitoylation status of proteins with only one cysteine intact. All caveolin-3 mutants containing a single cysteine were palmitoylated to some extent (Figure <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). The principal palmitoylation sites detected in caveolin-3 in these experiments were cysteines 98, 106, 116, and 129. We also detected significant palmitoylation of cysteines 94 and 124, but very little palmitoylation of cysteines 19, 72, and 140 (Figure <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). Since the quadruple palmitoylated species is the most commonly detected by acyl-PEG exchange in ventricular muscle (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>), we conclude this represents caveolin-3 palmitoylated at cysteine 98, 106, 116, and 129. We propose that the additional two palmitoylation sites occupied in ventricular muscle are cysteines 94 and 124, but we do not rule out residual palmitoylation of other cysteines in caveolin-3. The caveolin-1 oligomer forms a flat disk 140 Å in diameter, in which the protomers' C termini are at the center of the disk, and its N termini on the edge. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> We mapped the positions of the caveolin-3 cysteines in the caveolin-1 cryo-EM structure PDB-7SC0. C140 (analogous to F167 in caveolin-1), which is not palmitoylated, lies close to the center of the disk facing the membrane (cyan in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Cysteines 106 116 and 129 (yellow in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>), which are conserved in caveolin-1, are located in two concentric circles in the oligomer, diameters approx. 50 Å and 90 Å: the inner circle is formed by C129 (C156 in caveolin-1), and the outer circle is formed from C116 (C143 in caveolin-1) from one protomer in close proximity to C106 (C133 in caveolin-1) from the neighboring protomer. The additional palmitoylation sites in caveolin-3 (orange in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) form two additional concentric circles, diameters approx. 65 Å and 110 Å. The smaller of these, midway between the caveolin-1 palmitoylation sites, is formed by C124 (Y151 in caveolin-1). The larger is formed from C94 (I121 in caveolin-1) and C98 (L125 in caveolin-1) from the same protomer. C72 (F99 in caveolin-1, cyan in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) which is not palmitoylated lies on the outer edge of the disk, and C19 is not resolved. None of the cysteines or their analogous residues are visible on the cytosolic face of the caveolin-1 oligomer: they all face the membrane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">| Palmitoylation and protein interactions of caveolins</head><p>Caveolin forms homo-oligomers composed of 11 protomers. Our palmitoylation site mapping experiments imply that caveolin-3 homo-oligomers would incorporate up to 66 palmitate molecules. We investigated whether protein interactions of caveolin were influenced by its palmitoylation status, and whether they were different for the more heavily palmitoylated caveolin-3. We generated a caveolin-3 mutant in which only the cysteines analogous to caveolin-1 cysteines were intact (C106, C116, C129), which we denoted "caveolin-1-like" (C1L). We compared the protein interactions of cysless caveolin-3, C1L, and wildtype caveolin-3 co-transfected with the heterotrimeric G protein inhibitory α subunit 2 (GNAI2) into HEK-293 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation of Gnai2 with C1L or WT caveolin-3 was essentially identical (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>). However, cys-less caveolin-3 co-purified significantly less with Gnai2 than either WT or C1L. We considered the possibility that caveolin-3 palmitoylation mutants were either not incorporated into the membrane or did not oligomerize. HEK-293 cells expressing wild-type, cysless, or C1L caveolin-3 were fractionated into cytosolic and membrane fractions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>). A small fraction of caveolin-3 was detected in the cytosolic fraction, but the same fraction of cys-less and C1L protein was cytosolic as wild-type caveolin-3. Oligomerization of caveolin-3 can be visualized by partial formaldehyde fixation of intact cells, followed by electrophoresis and western blotting to detect oligomerized caveolins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Cysless and C1L caveolin-3 oligomerized in an identical fashion to wild-type caveolin-3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>). Hence, we conclude that although non-palmitoylated caveolins are capable of oligomerizing, they do not fully support physical interactions with caveolar resident proteins. However, the additional palmitoylation sites in caveolin-3</p><p>do not influence its interaction with Gnai2 compared to caveolin-1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">| Glutathiolation of caveolin-3</head><p>We loaded rat ventricular myocytes with cell permeable biotinylated glutathione ethyl-ester (bioGEE), purified glutathiolated proteins using streptavidin beads, and identified them using mass spectrometry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>). We considered proteins to be bone fide glutathiolation candidates if they were detected in three out of four independent experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B</ref>), which generated a list of 150 glutathiolated proteins in rat ventricular myocytes (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(A) (B) (C)</head><p>We validated candidate glutathiolated proteins by immunoblotting (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>) and confirmed that streptavidin capture of selected candidates (heterotrimeric G protein stimulatory subunit alpha (Gnas) and caveolin-3) required myocytes to be loaded with biotinylated glutathione ethyl ester (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5D</ref>). Subsequent experiments focussed on glutathiolation of caveolin-3 in ventricular muscle. We detected baseline glutathiolation of caveolin-3 in ventricular myocytes, which was elevated following treatment with the thiol stressor diamide but not by application of the exogenous oxidant hydrogen peroxide, the NADPH oxidase agonist angiotensin II, or oxidized glutathione disulfide (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>). In separate experiments, we sought to identify reversibly oxidized cysteines in caveolin-3 by replacing hydroxylamine with DTT in our PEGylation assay. Treatment of ventricular myocytes with diamide substantially increased PEGylation of caveolin-3 at a single cysteine in this assay (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6B</ref>). Since diamide is generally agreed to generate a thiol stress without generating free radicals, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> we interpret this band shift to indicate that caveolin-3 is predominantly glutathiolated at a single cysteine in ventricular myocytes. To identify this glutathiolation site, we expressed single cysteine mutants of caveolin-3 in HEK-293 cells and treated the cells with diamide. In our panel of single cys to ala mutants of caveolin-3, no single C to A mutation significantly reduced caveolin-3 glutathiolation assessed using bioGEE (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6C</ref>) and DTT-PEG exchange (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6D</ref>) assays, although the glutathiolation status of C19A caveolin-3 was consistently reduced compared to wild-type caveolin-3 in both assays. However, reintroduction of Cys-19 into cys-less caveolin-3 significantly increased caveolin-glutathiolation to a level not distinguishable from wild type (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6E</ref>). We conclude that Cys-19 is the principal site of glutathiolation in caveolin-3, although we cannot rule out residual glutathiolation of other sites when this site is removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">| Functional impact of caveolin-3 glutathiolation</head><p>Using diamide as a tool compound, we investigated the impact of increased caveolin-3 glutathiolation on caveolae in isolated ventricular myocytes. Using partial formaldehyde fixation, we found no difference in caveolin-3 oligomerization following diamide treatment (Figure <ref type="figure">7A</ref>), nor did diamide change the gross distribution of caveolin-3 on sucrose gradients (Figure <ref type="figure">7B</ref>). Indeed, when we considered the localization of caveolin in buoyant (fractions 4 &amp; 5) and dense (fraction 8) membranes isolated on a sucrose gradient, we detected no difference in the extent of palmitoylation or glutathiolation between fractions (Figure <ref type="figure">7C</ref>). We conclude that glutathiolation of caveolin-3 Cys-19 does not substantially remodel caveolin-3 localization to caveolae, so instead we investigated caveolin-3 protein interactions.</p><p>Some proteins are recruited to caveolae as a result of their interaction with a juxtamembrane scaffolding domain in caveolin (CSD). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Although the concept of the CSD as a universal means to target proteins into caveolae has been challenged in recent years, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> interactions between the CSD and certain caveolar proteins (e.g. G-protein alpha subunits, tyrosine kinases) are wellestablished and generally inhibit the activity of these signaling proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> We evaluated interaction of caveolin-3 with HA-tagged G protein alpha subunits in transfected HEK-293 cells, and the impact of caveolin-3 glutathiolation on these interactions by treating with diamide (Figure <ref type="figure">7D</ref>). Exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which does not alter caveolin-3 glutathiolation, did not change the  co-immunoprecipitation of caveolin-3 and either Gnai or Gnas, but treatment with diamide abolished the binding of caveolin-3 to both G proteins. We conclude that glutathiolation of caveolin-3 Cys-19 reduces the ability of the caveolin-3 CSD to interact with its binding partners.</p><p>Given the impact of caveolin-3 gluathiolation on its protein interactions, we evaluated the impact of caveolin-3 glutathiolation on G protein alpha subunit localization to caveolae using sucrose gradient fractionation of isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes. Lipidation of G protein alpha subunit N termini (S-palmitoylation and myristolylation of Gnai, N-palmitoylation, and S-palmitoylation of Gnas) recruit these proteins to caveolae/lipid rafts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> We observed no difference in the distribution of either G protein across a standard discontinuous sucrose gradient following glutathiolation of caveolin-3, suggesting these G proteins remain localized in caveolae following their dissociation from caveolin-3 (Figure <ref type="figure">7E</ref>). The burst of oxygen free radicals produced by mitochondria upon reperfusion of ischaemic cardiac tissue causes oxidative modifications of cardiac lipids and proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> We assessed whether global ischemia with or without reperfusion changed the glutathiolation status of caveolin-3 in rat hearts perfused in the Langendorff mode. Since it is impossible to load whole hearts with bioGEE, these experiments employed the DTT-PEG exchange assay to monitor caveolin-3 glutathiolation. We investigated a short period of ischemia (10 min) that stuns but does not irreversibly injure the myocardium <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> and reperfused for short (10 min) and long (30 min) periods. Caveolin-3 glutathiolation was not significantly altered following ischaemia-reperfusion (Figure <ref type="figure">7F</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| DISCUSSION</head><p>In this investigation, we set out to characterize cysteine post-translational modifications of caveolin-3. We find that up to six cysteines in caveolin-3 are post-translationally palmitoylated and a single cysteine is reversibly glutathiolated. Glutathiolation of caveolin-3 directly influences its binding to G proteins.</p><p>In cardiac muscle, 100% of caveolin-3 is palmitoylated, evidenced by its quantitative capture using assays such as acyl-RAC and acyl biotin exchange. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> The acyl-PEG exchange assay used in this investigation quantitatively PEGylates caveolin-3 in the sense that no "+0" species is identified following the PEGylation reaction. However, quantitative PEGylation of every previously palmitoylated cysteine requires there to be no steric impairment of multiple PEGylation events, which we do not rule out-particularly when considering the attachment of 6× 5 kDa PEG molecules within a short (46 amino acid) region of a 17.5 kDa protein. We therefore suggest that the predominant +4 palmitoylation stoichiometry for caveolin-3 from ventricular muscle identified by acyl-PEG exchange must be regarded as the "minimum" rather than "absolute" stoichiometry of caveolin-3 palmitoylation.</p><p>The cryo-EM structure of the caveolin-1 oligomer suggests that rather than possessing a classic re-entrant integral membrane loop, the oligomer displaces the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane bilayer, making direct contact with the outer leaflet of the membrane, into which the caveolin palmitates presumably insert. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> It is not currently understood how the profoundly flat caveolin oligomer can bend the membrane to induce the characteristic caveolar bulb shape. This shape is acquired even when caveolin-1 is expressed in bacteria, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> where it is not palmitoylated, so palmitoylation is clearly not integral to this process. Nevertheless, the ability of heavily palmitoylated proteins to induce membrane curvature and substantially remodel their local phospholipid environment is wellestablished. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> For example, molecular dynamics simulations suggest palmitoylation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (30 palmitates per spike trimer) induces formation of ordered cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich microdomains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> As well as modifying its phospholipid environment, we predict that the presence of up to 66 palmitates per caveolin-3 oligomer will significantly alter the packing of the phospholipid tails in the outer leaflet of the bilayer compared to the influence of up to 33 palmitates for oligomeric caveolin-1. The unique phospholipid environment in caveolae is achieved by lipid interactions of the caveolar structural proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> Our results therefore provide a mechanistic basis by which the phospholipid composition and overall architecture of caveolin-3 containing caveolae could be distinct from those formed from caveolins 1 or 2. Indeed, these are not the only differences between the caveolin isoforms. Differences in the caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 amino termini have recently been found to lead to notable differences in trafficking and proteostasis for these proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> Although only modest structural differences between palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated caveolin-3 were identified using NMR, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> these findings merit re-evaluation in the context of our discovery of 6 palmitoylation sites in caveolin-3, as that investigation compared the NMR structures of non-palmitoylated and triply palmitoylated caveolin-3.</p><p>What are the consequences of differential caveolin isoform palmitoylation for caveolar resident proteins? Although caveolin-3 is regarded as the muscle-specific caveolin isoform, all three caveolin isoforms are expressed in ventricular muscle, where caveolins 1 and 3 localize to distinct but adjacent microdomains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> The protein interactions of caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 in cardiac muscle are different. For example, caveolin-1 preferentially interacts with cavins 1 and 2 and aquaporin-1, whereas caveolin-3 interacts with transporter proteins such as NCX1, Na/K ATPase, Glut-4 and the monocarboxylate transporter McT1. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> If the differential palmitoylation profile of caveolin isoforms drives the formation of distinct phospholipid microenvironments, different protein species are likely to be attracted to these microenvironments. Ultimately then, proteins may be either colocalized or kept apart in separate microdomains as a result of the differential lipid post-translational modifications of the caveolins that form these domains.</p><p>Considering the positions of the additional palmitoylation sites in the caveolin-3 oligomer, two additional concentric "rings" of palmitoylated cysteines exist compared to caveolin-1. We did not detect significant palmitoylation of the cysteine closest to the 11-stranded βbarrel located at the center of the structure, but in contrast the outermost ring of palmitoylated cysteines (Cys-94, Cys-98) adds palmitate at the edge of the oligomer, where phospholipid interactions may occur. In this context, it is notable that Cys-72 from one protomer is immediately adjacent to Cys-94 in the adjacent protomer but remains nonpalmitoylated. The caveolin oligomer assembles in the endoplasmic reticulum <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> but is palmitoylated later in the secretory pathway. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Evidently, there is sufficient specificity to caveolin-3 palmitoylation to prevent palmitoylation at Cys-72 despite its close proximity to other palmitoylated cysteines. How the active site of the caveolin-3 palmitoylating enzyme(s) manages to access up to 66 cysteines across the hydrophobic face of the assembled caveolin oligomer requires further investigation.</p><p>The caveolin scaffolding domain proposed to interact with caveolar resident proteins is residues 61-101 of caveolin-1 (34-74 of caveolin-3). <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> Caveolin-1 82-101 directly interacts with heterotrimeric G Protein α subunits, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> but we found caveolin-3 interaction of G protein α subunits was reduced when it was glutathiolated at Cys-19, which lies outside the proposed caveolin scaffolding domain. This region of the caveolin N terminus is disordered and ripe for protein-protein interactions. Post-translational modifications, even outside the site of interaction, may cause the caveolin N terminus to adopt a conformation that does not interact favorably with G proteins. No matter how Cys-19 glutathiolation abolishes caveolin-3's interaction with G proteins, it is notable that this redox sensitivity of protein interaction is another unique adaptation of the musclespecific caveolin isoform identified in this investigation. Since the interaction of caveolins with G proteins is generally regarded as inhibitory, our results suggest a paradigm in which redox stress can modify signaling downstream of G proteins. A similar paradigm is already established for the kinases regulated by second messengers produced by these G proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> An important question for future investigations will be how glutathiolation of caveolin-3 modifies G protein activation and second messenger production. For example, desensitization of signaling via the heterotrimeric G protein Gnaq, which was not investigated in this study, is mediated by a physical interaction with caveolin-3, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> and the caveolin-3-Gnaq relationship directly regulates calcium handling in ventricular muscle. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">| Limitations</head><p>We acknowledge that the extent to which caveolin-3 expressed in HEK-293 cells is palmitoylated is generally less than is observed in ventricular muscle and H9c2 cells. The consequences of this are that HEK-293 cells may not exactly reproduce the palmitoylationdependent functional differences between caveolin-1 and caveolin-3. Experiments using transgenic models or CRISPR-engineered cardiomyocyte-derived cells expressing palmitoylation-defective caveolin-3 are merited to fully characterize the differences between caveolin isoforms mediated by their differential palmitoylation.</p><p>We report reduced co-immunoprecipitation of caveolin-3 with G protein α subunits under oxidative conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation infers proximity rather than a direct interaction, so we acknowledge the possibility that glutathiolation does not directly influence caveolin-3 binding to G protein α subunits. Indeed, since we find G protein α subunits themselves are glutathiolated we do not rule out the possibility that their modification impacts their co-immunoprecipitation with caveolin-3 or membrane localization.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>F 3 . 2 |</head><label>32</label><figDesc>I G U R E 2 Caveolin-3 palmitoylation in cells and tissue.
