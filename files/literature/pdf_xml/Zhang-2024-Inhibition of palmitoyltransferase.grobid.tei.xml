<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Platinum-based therapies have revolutionized the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). However, high rates of disease recurrence and progression remain a major clinical concern. Impaired mitochondrial function and dysregulated reactive oxygen species (ROS), hallmarks of cancer, hold potential as therapeutic targets for selectively sensitizing cisplatin treatment. Here, we uncover an oncogenic role of the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC12 in regulating mitochondrial function and ROS homeostasis in HGSOC cells. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer data revealed significantly elevated ZDHHC12 expression, demonstrating the strongest positive association with ROS pathways among all ZDHHC enzymes. Transcriptomic analysis of independent ovarian cancer datasets and the SNU119 cell model corroborated this association, highlighting a strong link between ZDHHC12 expression and signature pathways involving mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and ROS regulation. Knockdown of ZDHHC12 disrupted this association, leading to increased cellular complexity, ATP levels, mitochondrial activity, and both mitochondrial and cellular ROS. This dysregulation, achieved by the siRNA knockdown of ZDHHC12 or treatment with the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2BP or the fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75, significantly enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in 2D and 3D spheroid models of HGSOC through ROS-mediated mechanisms. Markedly, ZDHHC12 inhibition significantly augmented the antitumor activity of cisplatin in an ovarian cancer xenograft tumor model, as well as in an ascites-derived organoid line of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Our data suggest the potential of ZDHHC12 as a promising target to improve the outcome of HGSOCs in response to platinum-based chemotherapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Correlation of ZDHHC12 expression with redox regulation and mitochondrial metabolism</head><p>Recent research highlights the critical role of ROS in cisplatinmediated cytotoxic effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> By analyzing TCGA ovarian cancer data using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, we identified ZDHHC12 as the ZDHHC enzyme most significantly associated with ROS-related pathways (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>), suggesting its potential regulatory role in these processes. Notably, ZDHHC12 expression is significantly elevated in 12 cancer types, including ovarian cancer (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Further analysis using HALLMARK and Gene Ontology (GO) signature pathways revealed strong correlations between ZDHHC12 expression and pathways related to ROS regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial metabolism in ovarian cancer (Figure <ref type="figure">1C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>). Strikingly, these correlation patterns were consistent in two independent ovarian cancer datasets (GSE74357 28 and GSE26193 29 ) (Figure <ref type="figure">1E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>). Taken together, these findings implicate ZDHHC12 as a potential therapeutic target for modulating ROS and mitochondrial processes that may influence cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Inhibition of ZDHHC12 expression sensitizes HGSOC cells to cisplatin treatment</head><p>Our investigation of the effect of ZDHHC12 on cisplatin sensitivity revealed that, among six nuclear-localized palmitoyltransferases (including ZDHHC5, ZDHHC8, ZDHHC12, ZDHHC15, ZDHHC16 and ZDHHC23 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> ), only knockdown of ZDHHC12 significantly enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in HGSOC cells (SNU119 and OVSAHO) (Figure <ref type="figure">2A-C</ref>). Furthermore, the knockdown of ZDHHC12 in combination with cisplatin proved to be more effective than either alone, as evidenced using clonogenic survival assays and increased apoptosis (Figure <ref type="figure">2D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>). Combined treatment with cisplatin and siZD-HHC12 also induced massive disintegration of the tumor spheroids of SNU119 and OVSAHO cells (Figure <ref type="figure">2F</ref>). These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of ZDHHC12 inhibition in potentiating the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in HGSOC.</p><p>To explore the clinical relevance of our findings, we investigated whether inhibition of ZDHHC12 could overcome cisplatin resistance. Gene expression analysis revealed significantly higher levels of ZDHHC12 in cisplatin-resistant OVCAR8 spheroids (Figure <ref type="figure">2G</ref>), suggesting an association with cisplatin resistance. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of ZDHHC12 on cisplatin response using an ascites-derived organoid line of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer as a preclinical model (Figure <ref type="figure">2H</ref>). The combined use of siZDHHC12 and cisplatin, but not either alone, significantly reduced tumor organoid growth (Figure <ref type="figure">2I</ref>). These data suggest that ZDHHC12 is a promising therapeutic target for overcoming cisplatin resistance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">| ZDHHC12 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and redox homeostasis in ovarian cancer cells</head><p>We further asked whether ZDHHC12 is involved in the modulation of mitochondrial activity in ovarian cancer. We found that the knockdown of ZDHHC12 resulted in pronouncedly increased internal complexity of SNU119 and OVASHO cells using flow cytometry analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3A</ref>), indicating increased organelles and metabolic functions within the cytoplasm. As the knockdown of ZDHHC12 also resulted in increased ATP levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3B</ref>), we speculated that ZDHHC12 may be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial function for ATP production. Indeed, inhibition of ZDHHC12 resulted in increased MitoTracker staining as determined using immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis, indicating increased mitochondrial activity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>). Confocal microscopy analysis revealed higher intensity MitoTracker staining in 3D spheroids of siZDHHC12transfected cells than in those of control cells, further supporting a potential functional link between ZDHHC12 and the regulation of mitochondrial function (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3E</ref>). Taken together, these data indicate that inhibition of ZDHHC12 may increase mitochondrial mass and promote mitochondrial function for ATP synthesis.</p><p>To gain insight into the mechanism underlying the high expression levels of ZDHHC12 in ovarian cancer, we performed RNA sequencing analysis to assess the effect of siRNA-mediated ZDHHC12 knockdown on specific transcriptional changes in SNU119 cells. Significant transcriptional changes were observed compared with the control cells (Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>). GSEA identified a significant association of ZDHHC12 expression with pathways involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function (Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>), mirroring findings from independent ovarian cancer datasets (Figure <ref type="figure">1D-F</ref>).</p><p>Consistent with these pathways relaying on mitochondrial activity for ROS generation, ZDHHC12 knockdown significantly increased basal mitochondrial and cellular ROS levels in SNU119 and OVSAHO cells as determined using flow cytometry (Figure <ref type="figure">4C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>). Notably, ZDHHC12 knockdown further exacerbated H 2 O 2 -induced ROS elevation, which was reversed with the ROS scavenger NAC. These findings suggest that ZDHHC12 plays a role in redox regulation in ovarian cancer, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to regulate redox balance and combat the disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">| Inhibition of ZDHHC12 enhanced cisplatin sensitivity through ROS-mediated mechanisms</head><p>Given the association of ZDHHC12 with mitochondrial function, we hypothesized that its inhibition could potentially enhance cisplatin sensitivity through ROS regulation. Combination treatment with siZD-HHC12 and cisplatin significantly increased ROS levels, while subsequent treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC reversed these effects on ROS production (Figure <ref type="figure">5A</ref>), cell viability (Figure <ref type="figure">5B</ref>  in SNU119 and OVASHO cells (Figure <ref type="figure">5C</ref>), indicating a ROS-dependent mechanism. Confocal microscopy in 3D spheroids further corroborated these findings, revealing a much stronger ROS signal upon combined treatment compared with single-agent exposures (Figure <ref type="figure">5D</ref>). These data provide compelling evidence that inhibition of ZDHHC12 enhances the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in HGSOC cells by potentiating cisplatin's cytotoxicity through ROS-mediated mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">| Inhibition of protein palmitoylation sensitized HGSOC cells to cisplatin treatment</head><p>Next, we validated the role of ZDHHC12-mediated protein palmitoylation in cisplatin response. The broad-spectrum protein palmitoylation inhibitor 2BP has been widely used to validate the biochemical and biological effects of ZDHHC protein inhibition in preclinical studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> In addition, FASN is known to be required for de novo palmitate synthesis, and thus the inhibition of FASN would block de novo protein palmitoylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> We used 2BP and C75 to potentially mimic ZDHHC12 inhibition. Indeed, treatment with 2BP, and to a greater extent with C75, significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in the 2D culture and 3D spheroid model of HGSOC cells (SNU119 and OVSAHO) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>). Notably, the enhanced cytotoxicity induced by the combination treatment was correlated with a significant increase in apoptosis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>). Furthermore, while the combined use of 2BP or C75 with cisplatin resulted in a marked ROS accumulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref>), treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC significantly reduced ROS levels and abrogated the sensitivity of HGSOC cells to the drug combination, as evidenced using restored cell viability and decreased apoptosis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>). Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of protein palmitoylation or blockade of de novo palmitate synthesis sensitizes HGSOC cells to cisplatin through ROS-mediated mechanisms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">| Inhibition of ZDHHC12 enhanced cisplatin response in vivo</head><p>To validate the therapeutic potential of ZDHHC12 inhibition in vivo, we used a xenograft mouse model of SNU119 ovarian cancer cells for preclinical evaluation of cisplatin response. Strikingly, while single-agent treatment with siZDHHC12 or cisplatin showed limited tumor growth reduction, the combination treatment significantly potentiated the efficacy of cisplatin (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).

We validated our in vitro findings by demonstrating the combinatorial therapeutic effect of siZDHHC12 and cisplatin in an ovarian cancer xenograft tumor model. We explored translational relevance in the context of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer. First, high ZDHHC12 expression correlated significantly with cisplatin-resistant OVCAR8 spheroids. Second, ZDHHC12 inhibition significantly enhanced the cisplatin cytotoxicity in an ascites-derived organoid line of ovarian cancer resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy. We further validated our in vitro findings by demonstrating the combinatorial therapeutic effect of siZDHHC12 and cisplatin in an ovarian cancer xenograft tumor model. These findings identify ZDHHC12 as a crucial modulator of cisplatin response, opening exciting avenues for the development of targeted therapies and overcoming resistance to significantly improve outcomes for ovarian cancer patients.</figDesc></figure>
