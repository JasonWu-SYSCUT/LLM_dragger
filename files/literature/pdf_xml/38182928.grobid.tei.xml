<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Palmitoylation of cysteine residues at the C-terminal hypervariable regions in human HRAS and NRAS, which is necessary for RAS signaling, is catalyzed by the acyltransferase DHHC9 in complex with its accessory protein GCP16. The molecular basis for the acyltransferase activity and the regulation of DHHC9 by GCP16 is not clear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human DHHC9-GCP16 complex and its yeast counterpartthe Erf2-Erf4 complex, demonstrating that GCP16 and Erf4 are not directly involved in the catalytic process but stabilize the architecture of DHHC9 and Erf2, respectively. We found that a phospholipid binding to an arginine-rich region of DHHC9 and palmitoylation on three residues (C24, C25 and C288) were essential for the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex. Moreover, we showed that GCP16 also formed complexes with DHHC14 and DHHC18 to catalyze RAS palmitoylation. These findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanism of RAS palmitoyltransferases.</p><p>The RAS GTPases switch between an inactive GDP-bound state and an active GTP-bound state. This process is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . In addition, lipidation adds another layer of regulation to RAS GTPases. Each RAS isoform has a CAAX motif at its C-terminus in which the cysteine residue can be prenylated; after prenylation, AAX is removed by RAS converting CAAX endopeptidase 1 (RCE1), and the exposed carboxyl group of the prenylated cysteine is methylated by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Some RAS isoforms, such as human HRAS and NRAS, carry a second type of lipidation-palmitoylation, which occurs on cysteine residues upstream of the CAAX motif <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . HRAS and NRAS localize to Golgi membrane after prenylation followed by CAAX motif processing, then traffic to plasma membrane upon palmitoylation and leave the plasma membrane when the palmitoylation is erased by depalmitoylases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Both palmitoylation and depalmitoylation steps are potential targets for the treatment of cancers caused by HRAS or NRAS abnormal activation, as evidenced by the findings that blocking either step disrupts the oncogenic activity of the NRAS G12D mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> .</p><p>The palmitoylation of human HRAS and NRAS has been reported to be catalyzed by a protein complex formed by DHHC9 and GCP16 (also called GOLGA7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . DHHC9 belongs to a family of cysteine acyltransferases that catalyze the covalent attachment of a palmitoyl group (or other long-chain acyl groups) to the side chain of cysteine residues via thioester bond <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> . Members in this family share two structural features that are related to their conserved catalytic mechanism: one is a cysteine rich domain in which a conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) motif has been identified as the catalytic center (thus the cysteine acyltransferases are also known as DHHC acyltransferases); the other is a long-chain acyl group-binding pocket formed by four transmembrane helices (TMs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> . In human, 23 DHHC acyltransferases have been</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Article</head><p>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5 may decrease the binding between RAS proteins and the palmitoyltransferases, thereby resulting in lower palmitoylation efficiency in comparison with that in cells.</p><p>Next, we tested whether the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex could recognize the substrates of each other. For HRAS, only a faint palmitoylation band was detected in the presence of Erf2-Erf4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>), which was much weaker than that in the presence of DHHC9-GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>). Similar results were observed for RAS2, but in an opposite way: palmitoylation of RAS2 in the presence of DHHC9-GCP16 was much weaker than in the presence of Erf2-Erf4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f-i</ref>), consistent with the finding that expression of human DHHC9-GCP16 in yeast only slightly reversed the growth defect caused by erf2 gene knockout <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> .</p><p>The C-terminal region of HRAS was reported to be sufficient for the correct localization of HRAS in cells, and GFP with its C-terminus fused with the C-terminal 9, 19 or 24 amino acids (a.a.) of HRAS has been used to study HRAS palmitoylation and trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> . We designed several chimeric proteins by exchanging the C-termini of RAS2 and HRAS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). When catalyzed by Erf2-Erf4, the palmitoylation of HRAS was at a very low level and had little increase when its C-terminal 10 or 24 a.a. was replaced by the C-terminal 10, 24 or 35 a.a. of RAS2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f</ref>,h and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>); RAS2 palmitoylation was decreased a lot when its C-terminal 10 a.a. was replaced by the corresponding sequence in HRAS, and was further decreased when its C-terminal 24 a.a. was replaced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>). When catalyzed by DHHC9-GCP16, HRAS palmitoylation was slightly decreased when its C-terminal 10 or 24 a.a. was replaced by RAS2 sequence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>); meanwhile, RAS2 palmitoylation was increased when its C-terminal 10 or 24 a.a. was replaced by the corresponding sequence of HRAS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g,</ref><ref type="figure">i</ref>). These data suggest that the C-terminus of RAS2 is necessary but not sufficient for its palmitoylation catalyzed by Erf2-Erf4. This finding is different from a previous finding that the C-terminal 35 a.a. of RAS2 were sufficient for palmitoylation in vivo and in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> . In contrast, the C-terminus of HRAS largely determines whether the whole protein can be palmitoylated or not by DHHC9-GCP16.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall structures of RAS palmitoyltransferases</head><p>We solved the structures of the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex using cryo-EM at resolutions of 3.5 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> and Extended Data Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). In both structures, the DHHC enzyme (Erf2 or DHHC9) forms a heterodimer with the accessory protein (Erf4 or GCP16). The overall structures of Erf2 and DHHC9 are similar to that of DHHC20 (ref. 9). Specifically, they all have four TMs, a large cytoplasmic region between TM2 and TM3 containing three anti-parallel β-sheets that form two zinc finger motifs, and another cytoplasmic region after TM4 containing two conserved α-helices (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>,e and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>).</p><p>The C-terminus (residues 304-364) of DHHC9 was not resolved in the cryo-EM map. In the crystal structure of DHHC20, the C-terminus (residues 297-365) also lacks electron density <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> , indicating that the C-termini of DHHC9 and DHHC20 exhibit inherent flexibility. A truncated form (residues 1-305) of DHHC9 showed catalytic activity similar to that of the full-length DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>), suggesting that the C-terminal region may not contribute to the catalytic activity of DHHC9.</p><p>The structures of DHHC9 and DHHC20 mainly differ at four variable regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2g</ref>,h and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). First, the N-terminus (residues 9-32) of DHHC9 adopts a loop-like structure; in contrast, the N-terminus of DHHC20 is an α-helix that is an extension of TM1. Second, the region between TM2 and the zinc finger motifs in DHHC9 contains an α-helix (α1) and an anti-parallel β-sheet (β1 and β2), but in DHHC20 there are two α-helices (α1 and α2) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a</ref>). Third, the region between the two conserved α-helices after TM4 is a loop-like linker in both DHHC9 and DHHC20 but adopts distinct conformation. The fourth is the region after α3 in DHHC9 and that after α4 in DHHC20: in identified to have various subcellular localizations and substrate specificities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> . The crystal structures of DHHC20 and its complex with palmitoyl-CoA have been reported, providing valuable insights into the structures and catalytic activities of DHHCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> . In comparison with DHHC20 that functions as a monomer, DHHC9 is unique because it has to associate with GCP16 to acquire its catalytic activity and maintain its stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . The molecular mechanism underlying the necessity of GCP16 for DHHC9 remains unclear. Furthermore, the precise regulatory mechanisms governing the activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex are yet to be elucidated.</p><p>The human DHHC9 and GCP16 were identified by searching the human genomic database with the protein sequences of yeast Erf2 and Erf4, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . The yeast Erf2-Erf4 complex is the first enzyme identified as a DHHC acyltransferase, which catalyzes the palmitoylation of RAS2-a homolog of the human RAS proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12</ref> . Similar to the requirement of GCP16 by DHHC9, the accessory protein Erf4 is necessary for the catalytic activity and stability of Erf2 (ref. 13). It has been 20 years since the identification of the Erf2-Erf4 complex as a cysteine acyltransferase; however, its three-dimensional structure has not been reported.</p><p>In this Article, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of both the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex, explaining why the accessory proteins Erf4 and GCP16 are required for the catalytic activity of Erf2 and DHHC9, respectively. We identified a phospholipid that functions as a hub to hold TM2, TM3 and a type II polyproline (PPII) helix of DHHC9 together. We also identified palmitoylation modifications at three cysteine residues in DHHC9, mutations of which significantly decreased the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex. Additionally, we found that GCP16 also functions as an accessory protein for DHHC14 and DHHC18, and DHHC14 and DHHC18 in complex with GCP16 could also catalyze RAS palmitoylation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Substrate specificity of RAS palmitoyltransferase</head><p>We overexpressed the Erf2-Erf4 complex and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex in insect cells and in Expi293F cells, respectively, and purified them to homogeneity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). The ratio of zinc ions to DHHC9 in the DHHC9-GCP16 complex was close to 2 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>). To evaluate their palmitoyltransferase activities, we used a fluorescent analog of palmitoyl-CoA (N-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4 -yl)-methyl]amino palmitoyl-CoA, NBD-palmitoyl-CoA) as the palmitoyl group donor <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14</ref> , and used yeast RAS2 and human HRAS (and NRAS) as the substrates of Erf2 and DHHC9, respectively. At specified time points, the reactions were terminated and analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The SDS-PAGE gel was initially examined using fluorescent imaging to measure the NBD fluorescence signal, and then stained with Coomassie blue to determine the protein sample loads (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Palmitoylation of RAS2 was observed in the presence of the wild type but not the C203A catalytic dead mutant of Erf2 in complex with Erf4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). C318 is the palmitoylation site in RAS2, downstream of which is the CAAX motif <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15</ref> . The C318A mutation decreased the palmitoylation level of RAS2, but a weak NBD signal was still observed, which may be due to the palmitoylation of C319 in the CAAX motif (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). Similarly, palmitoylation of HRAS and NRAS was observed in the presence of the wild type but not the C169A catalytic dead mutant of DHHC9 in complex with GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>,d and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). C181 and C184 in HRAS, and C181 in NRAS, are the sites undergoing palmitoylation 2 ; mutations of these cysteine residues to serine substantially decreased the palmitoylation level of HRAS and NRAS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). These results confirmed the catalytic activities of the purified RAS palmitoyltransferases. It should be noted that the RAS proteins used in these assays were recombinantly expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, and they were not prenylated. The lack of prenylation Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5 DHHC9 there is a PPII helix followed by a loop structure, but in DHHC20 there is a short α-helix followed by a loop structure with a distinct orientation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2g</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). The four variable regions in DHHC9, especially variable regions 1, 2 and 4, are important for the formation and function of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex, which will be discussed later.</p><p>The accessory proteins Erf4 and GCP16 have no TM, but both have two α helices inserted into the membrane (α5′ and α6′ in Erf4; α2′ and α3′ in GCP16) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). Interestingly, the two helices are at a position similar to that of helix α5 in DHHC20 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2f</ref>), which may partially explain why accessory proteins are required by Erf2 and DHHC9, but not DHHC20. The double mutation W278A/L279A in DHHC20 helix α5   <ref type="figure"></ref>and<ref type="figure">c</ref>) and that of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex (b and d) were evaluated using RAS2 and HRAS as the protein substrates, respectively, and using the NBD-palmitoyl-CoA as a substitute of palmitoyl-CoA. e, The linear diagrams of the chimeric RAS proteins. The chimeric protein HRAS-RAS2 (10 a.a.) or HRAS-RAS2 (24 a.a.) was generated by replacing the C-terminal 10 a.a. or 24 a.a. of HRAS with that of RAS2; similarly, the chimeric protein RAS2-HRAS (10 a.a.) or RAS2-HRAS (24 a.a.) was generated by replacing the C-terminal 10 or 24 a.a. of RAS2 with that of HRAS. f-i, The substrate specificity of the Erf2-Erf4 complex (f and h) and the DHHC9-GCP16 complex (g and i) were evaluated using chimeric RAS proteins. The data are the results of a representative experiment from three independent experiments (a, b, f and g): the SDS-PAGE gels imaged by fluorescence imaging, representing the NBD-palmitoylation level (top), and the same gels visualized by Coomassie blue staining (bottom); the bands of RAS2 and HRAS indicated by asterisks were the dimers of RAS2 and HRAS, respectively. The data in c, d, h and i, which represent the mean ± s.d. of three independent measurements, were analyzed using Prism.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">+ E r f 4 R A S 2 R A S 2 E r f 2 + E r f 4 E r f 2 + E r f 4 + R A S 2 ( C 3 1 8 A ) + R A S 2 ( C 3 1 8 A ) 4 f r E + ) A 3 0 2 C ( 2 f r E + R A S 2 E r f 2 ( C 2 0 3 A ) + E r f 4 + R A S 2 E r f 2 + E r f 4 + R A S 2 E r f 2 + E r f 4 + R A S 2</formula></div>

Both of them contain anti-parallel β-sheets formed by three β-strands (β1′, β5′ and β4′ in Erf4; β1′, β3′ and β2′ in GCP16), and two α-helices in the cytoplasmic region (α4′ and α7′ in Erf4; α1′ and α4′ in GCP16) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structures of the active sites and zinc finger motifs</head><p>The core of the active site of DHHC acyltransferases is the conserved DHHC motif, in which the cysteine residue can accept an acyl group from acyl-CoA and then transfer it to cysteine residues in substrate proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9</ref> . In the cryo-EM maps of Erf2 and DHHC9, densities for aliphatic chain-like structures linked to the catalytic cysteines in the DHHC motifs were observed, although no acyl-CoA was added during protein purification and cryo-EM sample preparation. The acyl groups in both structures are located behind solvent-accessible surfaces (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). The carbonyl oxygen of the acyl group forms a hydrogen bond (H-bond) with the first histidine (H201 in Erf2; H167 in DHHC9) in the DHHC motif. A saturated 14-carbon acyl group fit better than a 16-carbon acyl group in the density maps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref>). Despite that, autoacylation assays demonstrated that the Erf2-Erf4 complex favored acyl-CoA with chain lengths of 16 and 18 carbons as substrates, whereas the DHHC9-GCP16 complex preferred 16-carbon acyl-CoA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>).</p><p>The good quality of the cryo-EM maps of DHHC9 and Erf2 (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>) enables us to analyze the interactions between the acyl groups and their respective binding pockets. In both Erf2 and DHHC9, the acyl group binding pockets consist mainly of hydrophobic residues from TM1, TM3 and TM4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Residues close to the catalytic cysteine are highly conserved among Erf2, DHHC9 and DHHC20 (residues W171, V172, F184 and L242 in DHHC9 and the corresponding residues in Erf2 and DHHC20) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). In contrast, residues surrounding the acyl chain tail display diversity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>).</p><p>The DHHC motif is part of the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that contains two zinc finger motifs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). The well-organized structure of the CRD enables the DHHC motif to adopt the right conformation to place the catalytic cysteine and the first histidine in the DHHC motif at the right position. Residues in the CRD are conserved among Erf2, DHHC9 and DHHC20 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Each zinc finger motif has three cysteine residues and one histidine to coordinate a zinc ion. Disruption of the zinc finger motifs leads to a loss of function of the DHHC enzymes. The R148W mutation in DHHC9 identified in XLID patients was reported to affect the autoacylation of DHHC9 (ref. 16). We confirmed it in our assay (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). Mutation of R148 to a bulky residue may disrupt the zinc-binding site formed by C141, C144, H154 and C161 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4d</ref>).</p><p>The zinc finger motifs are stabilized by the surrounding structures. In both Erf2 and DHHC9, there are intense hydrogen bonding interactions between the zinc-binding motifs and helix α2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). In addition, the linkers between TM2 and helix α1 in both Erf2 and DHHC9 hold the zinc finger motifs together through hydrogen bonding (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4c,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). In DHHC9, variable region 1 also stabilizes the zinc finger motifs: residues R20, N21 and A32 in variable region 1 form five H-bonds with the main chains of S156, I157, C158 and G173 and the side chain of N160 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4d</ref>). The R20E mutation decreased the activity of DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6b,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>), supporting the importance of variable region 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interactions between DHHC9 and its accessory protein GCP16</head><p>DHHC9 interacts with GCP16 mainly through four interfaces (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a</ref>). One is between TM2, TM3 of DHHC9 and α3′ helix of GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5b</ref>). The side chain of R85 in DHHC9 TM2 donates a H-bond to the main chain of Y76 in GCP16 α3′ helix; Y183 in DHHC9 TM3 interacts with Y76 in GCP16 α3′ helix through π-π stacking. Mutation of either DHHC9 R85 or GCP16 Y76 to alanine decreased the catalytic activity of DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6e,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>). The second is between the PPII helix of DHHC9 and GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5c</ref>). P290 and P293 in the PPII helix dock into two weakly negatively charged pockets formed by α1′-α2′ and α4′-α5′ helices of GCP16, while P292 in the PPII helix form a CH-π hydrogen bond with Y86 in GCP16 α3′ helix <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> . The first and second interfaces stabilize DHHC9 by holding its TM2, TM3 and the PPII helix together. The third is between the zinc finger motifs of DHHC9 and the loop following the β1′ strand of GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5d</ref>). P150 and F129 in DHHC9 interact with GCP16 Y18 through CH-π interaction and π-π stacking, respectively; DHHC9 E163 interacts with GCP16 R16 through chargecharge interaction. The importance of DHHC9 P150 is consistent with the identification of P150S mutation as a cause of X-linked intellectual disorders (XLIDs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> . The DHHC9 P150S mutant had a decreased autopalmitoylation level and lost its catalytic activity (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). The fourth interface is between DHHC9 α1 helix and GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5e</ref>). DHHC9 D100 interacts with K11 and F13 in GCP16 through charge-charge and anion-π interactions, respectively; DHHC9 E101 interacts with R118 and R121 in GCP16 through charge-charge interaction and H-bond, respectively; in addition, DHHC9 F104 forms π-π stacking with GCP16 F13. The fourth interface stabilizes DHHC9 α1 helix, thus indirectly stabilizing the linker between TM2 and the α1 helix that interacts with the zinc finger motifs through H-bonds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4f</ref>). Taken together, the third and fourth interfaces stabilize the zinc finger motifs of DHHC9.</p><p>An important finding in the DHHC9-GCP16 structure is the presence of a lipid-like molecule around a positively charged patch formed by R85, R179 and R298 in DHHC9 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5b</ref>). Based on the cryo-EM density, we docked a phosphatidic acid (PA)(12:0/12:0) into the structure. The phosphate group and the carbonyl oxygen of one of the two lauroyl groups of PA(12:0/12:0) interacts with R85, R179 and R298 through charge-charge interactions and H-bonds; R179 donates a hydrogen bond to the main chain of DHHC9 P292. Consistent with this observation, the R85A and R298E mutations decreased the catalytic activity of DHHC9. The R298E mutation also decreased the autopalmitoylation level of DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6e-h</ref>). These data suggest that the phospholipid functions as a hub to stabilize the conformation of TM2, TM3 and the PPII helix of DHHC9.</p><p>To determine whether the DHHC9-GCP16 complex indeed contains phospholipid species, we extracted small molecules from the purified protein samples and performed mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. As structural analysis indicated the lipid density appearing to be a PA species, we mapped the detected ions towards known PA species, and identified 20 PA species including PA ). However, we cannot rule out potential nonspecific lipid association during protein purification. Therefore, we further evaluated the impact of different phospholipids on the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). Upon washing with Triton X-100 to remove the bound lipids, the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex exhibited a decrease, which was partially restored by adding PA, but not phosphatidylcholines. These results provide additional support for the notion that PA plays a role in stabilizing the DHHC9-GCP16 complex.</p><p>The interactions between Erf2 and Erf4 share similar pattern with that between DHHC9 and GCP16, suggesting a conserved binding mode across species (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). view (e) and the lateral view (f) of the overall structure of DHHC20 (PDB code: 6BMN). g,h, Alignment of the cryo-EM structure of DHHC9 in the DHHC9-GCP16 complex with the crystal structure of DHHC20 to identify regions that have distinct structures in DHHC9 and DHHC20 (defined here as variable regions).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Palmitoylation regulates DHHC9 activity</head><p>In the cryo-EM map of DHHC9, there are extra densities linked to the side chains of C24, C25 and C288, and the shape of the densities indicates that these cysteine residues were modified by acyl groups (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). Using MS, we identified palmitoylation at both C25 and C288 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>); though no palmitoylation at C24 was identified, a palmitoyl group covalently linked to C24 matches well with the cryo-EM density (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>).</p><p>C24 and C25 are located in variable region 1 of DHHC9, which interacts with multiple other regions in DHHC9 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6a</ref>). Firstly, the  side chain of T22 and the carbonyl oxygen of the palmitoyl group attached to C24 form H-bonds with the side chain of K35 at the N-terminus of TM1; the main chain of M30 accepts an H-bond from the main chain of F88 in TM2. Secondly, variable region 1 interacts with the zinc finger motifs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">4d</ref>). Thirdly, T11, R12, K13 and D26 in variable region 1 form H-bonds with residues D297, R298, R299, G300 and L302, thus keeping DHHC9 PPII helix at a proper position to facilitate its interaction with GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6c</ref>). Palmitoylation of C24 and C25 anchors variable region 1 to the lipid bilayer, stabilizing its conformation and enabling it to interact with multiple regions in DHHC9. Supporting the structure observation, the C24A/C25A double mutation severely decreased the catalytic activity of DHHC9 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</p><p>C288 at the C-terminus of DHHC9 α3 helix is surrounded by TM2 and TM3 of DHHC9 and helix α2′ of GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6b</ref>). The palmitoyl group attached to C288 inserts into the lipid bilayer and docks into a hydrophobic pocket between TM2 and TM3 to bring DHHC9 α3 helix close to TM2 and TM3. The C288A mutant lost the activity to catalyze HRAS palmitoylation (Fig. <ref type="figure">6d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). C288 is at the center of a cysteine cluster including C283, C284 and C288 in DHHC9 and C69 and C72 in GCP16 α2′ helix. The catalytic activities of the C283A and C284A mutants were either slightly decreased or similar to that of wild-type DHHC9 (Fig. <ref type="figure">6d-f</ref>), but the double mutations C69A/C72A in GCP16 decreased the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex by about 70% (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">6e,</ref><ref type="figure">g</ref>). Although we did not observe palmitoylation at C69 or C72 of GCP16 in our MS data, a previous study showed that both cysteine residues were palmitoylated, and that the C69A/C72A double mutant could not localize to the Golgi <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> . These findings indicate that cysteine palmitoylation plays a crucial role in the membrane attachment of the DHHC9 α3 helix and GCP16 α2′ helix and is vital for maintaining the stability of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GCP16 is an accessory protein for DHHC14 and DHHC18</head><p>Alignment of the protein sequences of the 23 human DHHCs shows that DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC5 and DHHC8 are most closely related to DHHC9 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10a</ref>). A PPII helix in DHHC9 is located at the center of the DHHC9-GCP16 interface. We speculate that this PPII helix is a unique feature of DHHCs that require accessory proteins similar to GCP16. P290 and P293 in this PPII helix are conserved in Erf2 but not in DHHC20, and also conserved in DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC8 and DHHC19. The residue in DHHC5 corresponding to DHHC9 P290 is S247, but after S247, there is a proline residue (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10b</ref>). The alignment suggests that DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC8, DHHC5 and DHHC19 may also require GCP16-like accessory proteins. Indeed, GCP16 has been reported to form complexes with DHHC5 and DHHC8  (ref. 23). A homolog of GCP16-GOLGA7B-also interacts with DHHC5 to regulate its function <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> .</p><p>To test whether DHHC14 and DHHC18 can form complexes with GCP16, we transiently expressed them alone or together with GCP16 in Expi293F cells. As anticipated, DHHC14 and DHHC18 were found to be co-purified with GCP16 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). We also co-expressed DHHC19 with GCP16 in Expi293F cells, but unfortunately, no target protein was obtained after purification. Both DHHC14 and DHHC18 in complex with GCP16 can catalyze NRAS palmitoylation (Fig. <ref type="figure">7c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>), and prefer acyl-CoA with a chain length of 16 carbons (Fig. <ref type="figure">7e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). The catalytic activity of DHHC14 against NRAS was weaker than that of DHHC9 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). These data suggest that GCP16 is a universal accessory protein for DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18, and DHHC14 and DHHC18 may be involved in RAS palmitoylation.</p><p>Next, we assessed the activities of DHHC14 and DHHC18 to palmitoylate NRAS in HEK 293T cells. We employed small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down the expression of DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7g</ref>), then transiently expressed NRAS, which carried an activating mutation (Q61R) and had an HA-tag at its N-terminus. Subsequently, we evaluated the palmitoylation level of the NRAS(Q61R) mutant using click chemistry (Fig. <ref type="figure">7h</ref>). The double mutant NRAS(Q61R/C181S) was used as a control to mimic the depalmitoylated state of NRAS(Q61R). Knockdown of any of DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18 led to a reduction in NRAS(Q61R) palmitoylation, with knockdown of DHHC9 exhibiting a more pronounced effect. The distribution of NRAS(Q61R) was altered upon knockdown of DHHC9, DHHC14 or DHHC18 (Fig. <ref type="figure">7i</ref>). As observed in the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , NRAS exhibited localization to both the Golgi membrane and plasma membrane. Substitution of C181 in NRAS with serine resulted in a loss of membrane localization. Knockdown of DHHC9, DHHC14 or DHHC18 led to a redistribution of NRAS(Q61R) from the membrane to the cytoplasm (Fig. <ref type="figure">7i</ref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that DHHC14 and DHHC18 can catalyze the palmitoylation of NRAS in HEK 293T cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>A two-step ping-pong catalytic mechanism has been proposed for the DHHC acyltransferases: the acyl group is first transferred from acyl-CoA to the catalytic cysteines and then transferred to cysteine residues in substrate proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> . The structures of DHHC20 in the lipid-free state, the covalent inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate-bound state and the palmitoyl-CoA-bound state have been solved <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref> . The Erf2-Erf4 and the DHHC9-GCP16 complexes in our structures have their catalytic cysteines modified by an acyl group. To the best of our knowledge, our structures represent the first autoacylated structures of DHHCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).</p><p>The importance of acylation in RAS signaling has been known for more than 30 years (ref.</p><p>2); however, the mechanism for the regulation of RAS acylation is poorly understood. Many of the 23 human DHHCs function as monomers, but some have accessory proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> . The requirement of GCP16 by DHHC9 has been demonstrated by previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref> . Our structures show that GCP16 (or Erf4) binds to a surface of DHHC9 (or Erf2) that is opposite to the DHHC motif (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2a-d</ref>), suggesting that GCP16 and Erf4 are not directly involved in the catalytic process, but stabilize the architecture of DHHC9 and Erf2, respectively. Furthermore, our study and previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23</ref> demonstrate that GCP16 is an accessory protein for at least 5 of the 23 human DHHC acyltransferases (DHHC5, DHHC8, DHHC9, DHHC14 and DHHC18), indicating that GCP16 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of DHHC acyltransferases.</p><p>In the cryo-EM structure of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex, we identified a phospholipid binding to three arginine residues in DHHC9  (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5a</ref>). Among the three arginine residues, R85 is conserved only in DHHC14; R179 is conserved in DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC8, DHHC5 and DHHC19; R298 is conserved in DHHC14, DHHC18 and DHHC5 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10b</ref>). Therefore, we speculate that at least DHHC14 also binds to a phospholipid similar to that in DHHC9. We built a PA(12:0/12:0) into the cryo-EM structure of DHHC9. However, other PAs are also possible, since our data show that several PAs, including PA(12:0/12:0), PA(14:0/14:0), PA(18:1/18:1) and PA(16:0/18:1), could restore the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex decreased by removing the bound lipids (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that the bound phospholipid could be ceramide phosphates, which may also provide a phosphate group to interact with the arginine residues in DHHC9. It is worth testing whether the phospholipid is a constitutive component of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex or plays a regulatory role.</p><p>Another interesting finding is the palmitoylation of three cysteine residues in DHHC9. Among these cysteine residues, C25 is conserved in DHHC14 and DHHC18, while C288 is conserved in DHHC14, DHHC18, DHHC8, DHHC5 and DHHC19, suggesting a conserved role of cysteine palmitoylation in the regulation of DHHCs. In consistency with our finding, the corresponding residue of C288 in DHHC5, C245, was reported to be palmitoylated together with C236 and C237 in DHHC5 (ref. 28), and mutating the three cysteine residues to serine or alanine disrupted the interaction between DHHC5 and GCP16 or GOL-GA7B <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> . It is not clear whether the palmitoylation of C24, C25 and C288 in DHHC9 is a nonenzymatic event or catalyzed by DHHC9 or other DHHCs. The only palmitoylation cascade reported so far is the palmitoylation of DHHC6 by DHHC16 (ref. 29). Identification of the DHHCs that catalyze the palmitoylation of DHHC9 would reveal more palmitoylation cascades. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-023-01183-5</p></div>

Excess sample was blotted for 3.5 s with a blot force of 0 and was vitrified by plunging into liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fischer Scientific) at 8 °C and 100% humidity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cryo-EM image processing</head><p>For data processing process of the Erf2-Erf4 complex dataset, a flowchart is illustrated in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>. Movie stacks were motion-corrected with two-fold binning by Motioncor2 (ref. 31), and the resulting 15,626 dose-weighted micrographs with 1.087 Å pixel size were imported for patch-based contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation by cryoSPARC v3 (ref. 32). All the following steps were performed in cryoSPARC v3 unless otherwise stated. Through first round of particle picking and reference-free 2D classification, 514,743 good-quality particles with box size of 192 pixels were selected to reconstruct an initial model (ab-initio reconstruction job). To remove trash protein particles in 3D classification, we generated four bad references based on the initial model by 'Volume Eraser' in Chimera <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> , which represented outer membrane region only, micelle only, transmembrane region only and without TM maps. One round of five-class multi-reference 3D classification (heterogeneous refinement job) was performed, yielding 195,041 selected particles. However, the transmembrane region density of the good class was still noisy. To achieve a better map quality in the transmembrane region, we applied a strategy called 'noise reduction' to reduce the micelle noise and recover the weak signal of TMs. Briefly, a noise map of transmembrane micelle was generated by erasing signal of proteins in Chimera at first. Then, a weaker noise map was generated based on the noise map by multiplying 0.5 in Relion 3.0 (relion_image_handler -multiply_constant) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> . Finally, the noise-reweighted map was generated by the origin map subtracting the weaker noise map (relion_image_handler-subtract). Subsequently, five rounds of multi-reference 3D classification were performed with three references (the origin map, the noise-reweighted map and the noise map). After each round of 3D classification, the particles of the first two classes were subjected to the next round. A nonuniform refinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> was performed with 123,143 selected particles, resulting in a 3.7 Å map (Fourier shell correlation (FSC)0.143). To further improve the resolution, a new round of template picking was performed, whose templates were generated by re-projection of the 3.7 Å map (template creation job), yielding about 9.57 million particles. After two rounds of 2D classification, nearly 2.87 million particles were selected for subsequent 3D classifications and refinements. Similarly, one round of five-class multi-reference 3D classification and five rounds of three-class multi-reference (noise-reduction) 3D classification were performed, yielding 716,030 particles. The particles were then subjected to five additional rounds of multi-reference 3D classification with three references generated by different lowpass filters (60 Å, 30 Å and 10 Å). Then a nonuniform refinement was performed with 556,792 selected particles, resulting in a final map at 3.5 Å resolution (FSC 0.143). All the map figures were generated using Chimera or ChimeraX <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36</ref> .</p><p>For data processing process of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex dataset, a similar procedure was applied as for the Erf2-Erf4 complex dataset, and a flowchart can be found in Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>. Briefly, 21,926 dose-weighted micrographs with 0.8389 Å pixel size were applied for patch-based CTF estimation, particle picking and one round of 2D classification, yielding 281,430 particles with box size of 256 pixels. Subsequently, ab initio reconstruction and nonuniform refinement were performed, resulting in a 5.5 Å map (FSC 0.143). Then, six rounds of three-class multi-reference (noise-reduction) 3D classification and a further round of multi-reference 3D classification were performed, yielding a 3.9 Å map after nonuniform refinement with 124,470 particles. Subsequently, a further round of 3D classification with skip alignment (relion_refine_mpi -skip_align, K = 5, T = 8) was performed, yielding a 3.7 Å map after local refinement with 69,051 particles. To further improve the resolution, 17.47 million particles were repicked from the original micrographs, using templates generated by reprojection of the 3.7 Å map. About 1.98 million particles were selected after three rounds of 2D classification. After five rounds of three-class multi-reference (noise-reduction) 3D classification and five additional rounds of three-class multi-reference (low-pass gradient) 3D classification, 338,978 particles were selected. Subsequently, nonuniform refinement and one round of skip alignment 3D classification (K = 5, T = 4) were performed, yielding 236,228 selected particles that generated a final map at 3.4 Å resolution after local refinement.</p></div>

The LC-MS type of data was searched using the product ion. The mass tolerance for precursor ion and product ion was both set at 5.0 ppm. The product ions with relative intensities higher than 1% were selected for annotation. The tolerance for execute quantitation was set at m/z 5.0 ppm and retention time ±0.5 min. The isomer peaks were all filtered. The selected adduct ions were [M + H] + , [M + NH 4 ] + , [M + Na] + and [M + K] + for positively charged ions, and [M - H] -, [M + HCOO] -for negatively charged ions. For lipid annotation, the targeted class was either selected as all lipid classes or the PA class only. The three replicative data were aligned by retention time within ±0.6 min. All isomer peaks were filtered. Raw data are presented in Supplementary Dataset 1.</p></div>
