<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A superfamily of proteins called cysteine transmembrane is widely distributed across eukaryotes. These small proteins are characterized by the presence of a conserved motif at the C-terminal region, rich in cysteines, that has been annotated as a transmembrane domain. Orthologs of these proteins have been involved in resistance to pathogens and metal detoxification. The yeast members of the family are YBR016W, YDL012C, YDR034W-B, and YDR210W. Here, we begin the characterization of these proteins at the molecular level and show that Ybr016w, Ydr034w-b, and Ydr210w are palmitoylated proteins. Protein S-acylation or palmitoylation, is a posttranslational modification that consists of the addition of long-chain fatty acids to cysteine residues. We provide evidence that Ybr016w, Ydr210w, and Ydr034w-b are localized to the plasma membrane and exhibit varying degrees of polarity toward the daughter cell, which is dependent on endocytosis and recycling. We suggest the names CPP1, CPP2, and CPP3 (C terminally palmitoylated protein) for YBR016W, YDR210W, and YDR034W-B, respectively. We show that palmitoylation is responsible for the binding of these proteins to the membrane indicating that the cysteine transmembrane on these proteins is not a transmembrane domain. We propose renaming the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain as cysteine-rich palmitoylated domain. Loss of the palmitoyltransferase Erf2 leads to partial degradation of Ybr016w (Cpp1), whereas in the absence of the palmitoyltransferase Akr1, members of this family are completely degraded. For Cpp1, we show that this degradation occurs via the proteasome in an Rsp5-dependent manner, but is not exclusively due to a lack of Cpp1 palmitoylation.</p><p>A superfamily of proteins called cysteine-rich transmembrane (CYSTM) proteins was identified using a bioinformatics approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Members of this family were found to be widely distributed across eukaryotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. These proteins are in general small, ranging from 60 to 150 amino acids. The family was named CYSTM domain because they share a region at their C termini that was predicted to be an α-helical transmembrane region, containing 5 to 6 cysteine residues, which are highly conserved within the family. The N-terminal region is rich in proline, glycine, and glutamic acid and it is predicted to contain a β-strand region followed by a variable linker <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the family comprises the genes YBR016W, its paralog YDL012C, YDR034W-B, and YDR210W, with no defined function <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The manganese-chelating protein (Mnc1) (YBR056W-A) has also been proposed to be a member of the CYSTM family <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Mnc1 is a paralog of YDR034W-B, but does not have a CYSTM region as defined by Venancio et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, since it is not predicted to fold into a single α-helix (our unpublished observations). A role in manganese metabolism has also been proposed for Ydr034w-based both on a growth phenotype and its enhanced expression in the presence of this metal <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>High-throughput studies indicate that the yeast members of this family are localized to the plasma membrane (PM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>. CYSTM-containing orthologs (1) include the Schizosaccharomyces pombe stress and chemical response protein Uvi15 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, Digitaria ciliaris, and Oryza sativa CDT1, which confers resistance to heavy metals such as cadmium and copper <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> and the Arabidopsis representative of the family PCC1, which is induced upon pathogen exposure and its overexpression conferred resistance to oomycetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</p><p>More recently, 13 CYSTM genes were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. The expression of these genes was analyzed in different plant tissues and also in response to diverse stressors, leading to the postulate that they might have diverse roles in abiotic stress. Dimerization of some of these proteins was also suggested, based on two-hybrid experiments. Finally, they were shown to localize to the PM but also the cytosol and nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. A role in resistance to heat stress and to a lesser extent to UV radiation has been uncovered for two members of this family, also in Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>Expression of the human CYSTM1 gene is an early marker for Huntington's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>The genes YDL012C and YDR210W clustered in bioinformatics analyses based on the phenotypes of their corresponding deletion mutants, in the presence of a great variety of chemical compounds, suggesting they might be involved in resistance to stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>However, there is no data regarding the function of these proteins at the molecular level.</p><p>S-acylation, commonly known as palmitoylation, is the addition of long-chain fatty acid molecules to cysteine residues of a protein via a thioester bond. This modification is catalyzed by a family of palmitoyltransferases (PATs) characterized by the presence of a DHHC-CRD domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Yeast has seven members of this family on its genome, and there are 23 members of this family in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Both transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins can be modified by palmitoylation. The modification of otherwise soluble proteins results in their recruitment to membranes, often in combination with other signals such as prenylation, N-myristoylation, or a polybasic domain. Proteins can be anchored to membranes also by multiple palmitoylations, as is the case for the SNARE SNAP25 (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>). There are no consensus aminoacid sequences that dictate protein palmitoylation, and although the specificity of PATs in general, is incompletely understood, yeast PATs appear to have a preference for certain substrates. For instance, Erf2/Erf4 seem to modify heterolipidated proteins, Akr1 modifies hydrophilic proteins that bind to membranes through their palmitate moieties, Pfa4 modifies multispanning membrane proteins like amino acid permeases, while Swf1 recognizes single-spanning membrane proteins with cysteines close to the cytosolic border of their transmembrane domains (TMDs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we have begun the characterization of three members of the yeast CYSTM family.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CYTSM proteins are polarized and palmitoylated</head><p>Based on the sequence of CYSTM domains, we suspected they might be modified by palmitoylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). There are several examples in the literature of cysteine-rich domains that are palmitoylated (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Moreover, Ybr016w (CPP1) was identified as palmitoylated in the yeast palmitoylproteome <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>To detect CYSTM proteins, we generated GFP fusions to the N termini of Ybr016w (Cpp1), Ydr210w (Cpp2), and Ydr034w-b (Cpp3) and expressed them from a centromeric plasmid, under the control of the constitutive TPI1 promoter. The resulting chimaeras were observed under the microscope. All three fusions are localized to the PM in a WT strain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> upper panels). GFP-Cpp1 showed a polarized distribution to the growing bud. Some proteins achieve a polarized distribution through cycles of endocytosis and polarized secretion. This was shown for the SNARE protein Snc1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. When Snc1 endocytosis was blocked, polarized distribution was lost, and the protein was homogeneously distributed in the PM. When recycling to the PM was blocked, the protein is trapped inside the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>. GFP-Cpp1 was expressed in sla1Δ mutant in which endocytosis is greatly reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, and we can observe that the protein is no longer polarized (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> middle panel). Ric1 is required for efficient fusion of endosome-derived vesicles with the Golgi, leading to impaired recycling of proteins from the endocytic compartments to the PM when it is absent <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. When we expressed GFP-Cpp1 in a ric1Δ strain, the protein is now found in internal structures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> bottom panel), indicating that GFP-Cpp1 is dynamically polarized through endocytosis and polarized secretion. An endocytosis signal on the N-terminal domain of Ybr016w was previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</p><p>GFP-Cpp2 and GFP-Cpp3 are also polarized on the PM but to a lesser extent. This polarity is lost in a sla1Δ strain and internal staining was observed for both proteins in a ric1Δ strain, although a substantial amount of the proteins remains at the PM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, bottom panels), consistently with the partial polarization observed for these proteins in a WT strain.</p><p>To establish if the yeast CYSTM proteins are palmitoylated, we carried out acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Briefly, free thiols from cysteine residues in the protein samples are blocked by neutral N-ethylmaleimide and then treated with hydroxylamine (HA) to release thioester-bound palmitates. The free thiols are now reacted with a biotinylating agent, proteins are affinity-purified with streptavidin beads and the samples are analyzed for the presence of the GFP fusion proteins. Tris is used instead of HA as a control. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> shows that GFP-Cpp1, GFP-Cpp2, and GFP-Cpp3 are specifically pulled down in the HA-treated samples, indicating that they are palmitoylated.</p><p>Direct evidence for CYSTM proteins palmitoylation was obtained by metabolic labeling the cells with azido-palmitate, which can be later biotinylated using a click-chemistry approach. Palmitoylated proteins are then pulled down and identified by Western blot <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> shows that GFP-Cpp1 and GFP-Cpp2 are present in the samples labeled with azido-palmitate (azido-palm) (top panel). The palmitoylated protein Vac8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref> was detected, as a positive control (middle panel), while the non-palmitoylated Tom40 was used as a negative control. Since GFP-Cpp3 is expressed at lower levels than Cpp1 and Cpp2, we were unable to detect it using this technique.</p><p>Cpp1, Cpp2, and Cpp3 are bound to membranes via palmitoylation If CYSTM domains are transmembrane domains as postulated, some of their cysteines would be close to the cytosolic border of the TMD (Cys 110 and Cys 114 for Cpp1, see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) and therefore candidates for palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. In yeast, cysteines on the cytosolic border of the TMDs are almost exclusively modified by Swf1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. However, we and others have been unsuccessful in finding CYSTM proteins as substrates of Swf1. Moreover, a direct interaction between the PAT Akr1 and Cpp3 has been demonstrated in a proteinfragment complementation analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Additionally, transmembrane prediction algorithms do not consistently indicate that the CYSTMs are TMDs. Running Cpp1 on the Top-oloGYeast website <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, which provides the predictions from  The fusions localize to the plasma membrane (PM). GFP-Cpp1 is polarized to the new buds, and GFP-Cpp2 and GFP-Ccp3 are also polarized, to a lesser extent (upper panels). The polarized distribution of GFP-CCp1 is dependent on endocytic cycling since it is lost in a sla1Δ strain (middle panels). GFP-Cpp1 is lost from the PM in the recycling mutant ric1Δ and it is found in intracellular dots. GFP-Cpp2 and GFP-Cpp3 are also found inside the cell in a ric1Δ, but a substantial amount of fluorescence remains at the PM (lower panels). The scale bar represents 2 μm. C, acyl-biotin exchange assay on GFP-tagged Cpp1, Cpp2, and Cpp3 shows that these proteins are palmitoylated. In the hydroxylamine (HA)-treated samples, palmitates are exchanged for biotin, the proteins are pulled down using streptavidin beads and detected on a Western blot using anti-GFP antibodies. Negative nine different transmembrane prediction software, results in just four of them suggesting the presence of a TMD. Finally, transmembrane proteins of the secretory pathway, when overexpressed, usually show some staining of the vacuole, and this was never the case for the GFP-CYSTM protein chimeras evaluated in this study. For the reasons stated above, we suspected that perhaps, these proteins are not transmembrane but are anchored to the membrane by palmitates instead. To address this issue, WT cells expressing GFP-Cpp1, GFP-Cpp2, and GFP-Cpp3 were lysed, the lysate was centrifuged at 1,00,000g, and the membrane fraction was treated with neutral HA, which cleaves thioester-bound palmitates. The presence of GFP-Cpp1-3 in the treated membranes and the resulting supernatants were analyzed by Western blot. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref> show that significant amounts of the chimeric Cpp proteins are released from the membranes and can be observed in the soluble fraction upon HA treatment. The tail-anchored transmembrane protein Tlg1 is included as a bona fide transmembrane protein control, and it is unaffected by the HA treatment. Other treatments that are used to release peripheral proteins from the membranes, such as high salt concentration and sodium carbonate, fail to release GFP-Cpp1 from this fraction (not shown).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">C-terminus QQ QQ N Y Q GP HQQP V Y VQQQP P QRGNE GC L A AC L A A P QQP I Y VQQQP A S SGNE DC L AGC L AG C K L C S D L C S E E - - K P Q G Q Q V Y V P Q Q Q Q QQP V Y VQQP P P RRE SGGCC R TCC HF G N Y G N Y G N Y G Q Q Q Q Q Q QP Q Y YQQQQP Q Y YQQH P QQG Y YQQGP P QQG Y P P A Y H M N H H R M Q L C ICC TMDML F --- L C L CC T L DML F --- LCCC F L L E L VCDN - LCC LC L I NLCCDVF QQ Y N G Y QQQQQQ QQG Y YQ</formula></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> (bottom panel). However, Yck2 is aggregated in vitro and does not enter the gels when cells are broken by vigorous shaking with glass beads, which is how we prepared all samples. This has been carefully documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. On the other hand, Cpp1 and Cpp2 are quickly degraded when we try to digest the cell wall with zymolyase to prepare a protein lysate (not shown). This does not allow us to analyze both proteins in the same cells. Nevertheless, when we lyse cells-expressing GFP-Yck2 by cell wall digestion and treat membranes with HA, we can verify that the treatment is effective (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>, bottom panel). Please note that the multiple bands observed for Yck2 correspond to non palmitoylated, phosphorylated, or hyperphosphorylated species <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. The highest MW band corresponds to the palmitoylated species and it is released from the pellet by HA. We have also included as a control, a non-palmitoylable GFP-Cpp1 5xΔCys lacking all cysteines. This construct behaves similarly to a GFP-Cpp1 treated with HA, that is, only a small fraction of the protein is present in the 1,00,000g supernatant, confirming that Cpp proteins either bind to membranes by other means or are aggregated and thus partition to the pellet fraction. Second, we placed GFP-Cpp1 under the control of the GAL1 promoter and induced the expression of the protein in the presence of 20 μM of the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP). In these conditions, the protein is observed in the cytoplasm, consistent with the behavior of a lipid-anchored protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). The PM SNARE Sso1, a transmembrane protein, was included as a negative control and its localization is not affected by 2-BP treatment in these conditions. As a positive control we looked at the localization of the palmitoylated protein GFP-Yck2, which changes from a PM distribution to a cytoplasmic distribution in the presence of 2-BP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>, middle panels). Finally, we sought additional evidence of the nature of the CYSTM domain by analyzing its insertion in the membrane. If the CYSTM domain is indeed a TMD, proteins bearing this domain would be tail-anchored membrane proteins, since the putative TMD is located at their C termini. Many tail-anchored proteins are inserted into the membrane with the aid of the GET complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Mutant strains lacking either Get1 or Get2 show abnormal localization of tail-anchored proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Additionally, the EMC complex is involved in the insertion of low-hydrophobicity tailanchored proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows that while the tailanchored proteins Sso1 and Snc1 are mislocalized in get1Δ mutants, GFP-Cpp1 is unaffected. Snc1 and Sso1 are only mildly affected by the deletion of either EMC6 or EMC3, which are essential for the activity of the EMC complex. Again, GFP-Cpp1 is unaffected by the lack of either gene.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate the Cpp1, Cpp2, and Cpp3 and likely other CYSTM proteins are bound to membranes via palmitoylation and that the CYSTM domain is not necessarily transmembrane.</p><p>We, therefore, propose that this domain should be renamed to CYSPD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CYSPD proteins are degraded in an Rsp5-dependent manner in the absence of the PATs Akr1 and Erf2</head><p>Next, we investigated whether the lack of palmitoylation has consequences in the expression or localization of the CYSPD proteins. We expressed GFP-Cpp1 in strains that each lack one of the members of the PAT family in yeast. The localization of GFP-Cpp1 was similar in a WT, swf1Δ, pfa3Δ, pfa4Δ, pfa5Δ, and akr2Δ strains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>). In the erf2Δ strain, overall fluorescence appears to be lower. However, in an akr1Δ strain, the fluorescence signal is completely absent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>), suggesting that GFP-Cpp1 is being degraded. There are multiple examples in the literature that highlight the link between palmitoylation and protein stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. Lower levels of GFP-Cpp1 in akr1Δ and erf2Δ strains were confirmed by quantification of the fluorescence levels in these strains. The level of GFP-Cpp1 in an erf2Δ strain was reduced by half, and in an akr1Δ strain, the signal reduction is much more significant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>). GFP-Cpp2 and GFP-Cpp3 are not detectable both by fluorescence microscopy and Western blot in an akr1Δ strain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). The lack of Erf2 also affects the levels of these proteins but to different extents (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</p><p>Since GFP is resistant to vacuolar proteolysis in yeast and no fluorescence is observed in the vacuole, the degradation of these proteins appears to be proteasomal. Indeed, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> the proteasome inhibitor MG132 is added, however, the protein no longer localizes to the PM membrane, but to intracellular dots. These experiments were carried out in an erg6Δ genetic background, which makes the PM of these cells more permeable to drugs such as MG132 <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. These results are also consistent with the non-transmembrane nature of the CYSPD, since transmembrane proteins of the PM are mostly degraded in the vacuole. Many proteins at the yeast PM are ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, which controls multiple processes in the cell <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. Ydl012c was found to interact with Rsp5 in a high-throughput experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref> and indeed, it contains a PPXY motif. These motifs are known to interact with the WW domains of ubiquitin ligases such as Rsp5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42)</ref>. Since Rsp5 is an essential gene, we used a hypomorphic allele (43) (rsp5hm) to assess its role in the degradation of GFP-Cpp1 that takes place in an akr1Δ strain. We generated an akr1Δ rsp5hm double mutant, expressed GFP-Cpp1 and observed it under the fluorescence microscope. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref> shows that the protein now becomes detectable, confirming the role of Rsp5 in its degradation. The rescue of GFP-Cpp1 levels in the akr1Δ rsp5hm was also assessed by Western blot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5, C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). Interestingly, GFP-Cpp1 remains localized to the PM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>, lower panel), indicating that it is either still palmitoylated by other PATs or it is anchored to the membrane by some other means. We analyzed the palmitoylation status of this protein in the akr1Δ rsp5hm mutant by ABE. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B</ref> shows that GFP-Cpp1 is palmitoylated in this double mutant, suggesting that the protein can be palmitoylated by other PAT/s when degradation is prevented. The degradation of GFP-Cpp1 in the erf2Δ strain is also rescued by the rsp5hm mutation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</p></div>

Mutants were expressed in a wild-type strain and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref> shows that the expression levels of the single-cysteine mutants are similar to that of the wild type, and their PM localization is largely unaffected.</p><p>We  some remaining fluorescence on the PM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref> bottom panels) while the 5xΔCys mutant has no remaining fluorescence on the membrane. When the palmitoylation of these mutants was tested using an ABE assay, it was observed that, as expected, the 5xΔCys mutant is not palmitoylated, however, both (C 110, 114 A) and (C 119, C121, 122 A) are, suggesting that cysteines in both halves of the domain can be palmitoylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6D</ref>). Importantly, if the CYSPD was indeed a TMD, cysteines 119, 121 and 122 would be expected to be buried deep into the membrane and could not be palmitoylated. This is due to the cytosolic localization of the catalytic domains of PATs <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Palmitoylation dependent and palmitoylation independent degradation of GFP-Cpp1</head><p>Interestingly, none of the cysteine mutants of GFP-Cpp1 described above fully recapitulates the complete degradation triggered by the loss of Akr1, nor the partial degradation, while still maintaining membrane localization, that is observed in erf2Δ. It is possible that the absence of palmitoylation due to the lack of a PAT, which leaves free cysteine residues in the substrate, is not strictly equivalent to having no palmitoylation caused by point mutations in the cysteines <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Alternatively, the lack of Akr1 and Erf2 could have an indirect effect on the half-life of these proteins. To assess this point, we generated constructs in which we either truncated the CYSPD domain of Cpp1, (Cpp1-ΔCYSPD) or replaced it with the TMD of Sso1 (Cpp1-Sso1) and we expressed them in wild type and akr1Δ strains along with Cpp1-5xΔCys.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A</ref> indicates that when GFP-Cpp1 Cpp1-5xΔCys and Cpp1-ΔCYSPD are expressed in an akr1Δ strain, they are completely degraded, suggesting that loss of Akr1 can affect GFP-Cpp1 stability independently of its palmitoylation. On the other hand, Cpp1-Sso1 seems to be protected from degradation in an akr1Δ strain.</p><p>A similar experiment was carried out in an erf2Δ mutant. In this case, the loss of the PAT resulted in diminished levels of GFP-Cpp1 as expected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7B</ref>), but the degradation of mutants lacking the palmitoylation region (CYSPD) is no longer enhanced by the lack of Erf2. Cpp1-Sso1 is also expressed at higher levels in the WT strain and a decrease in the level of Cpp1-Sso1 TMD is observed in the mutant, suggesting that perhaps the stability of the construct is affected by the lack of Erf2, indirectly.</p><p>Overall, these results suggest that the loss of stability GFP-Cpp1 in an erf2Δ is likely due to diminished palmitoylation, while the loss of stability observed in akr1Δ mutants is mostly due to an indirect effect. However, palmitoylation of CYSPD domains by Akr1 cannot be discarded. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this work we have begun the characterization of a family of small proteins for which very little is known at the molecular and cell biological level. We showed that three of the four members of the CYSTM family of proteins are palmitoylated and that the domain is unlikely to be transmembrane, hence we suggest that the domain be renamed to CYSPD. Since some of the cysteines present in this domain are conserved, likely, homologs from other species will also be palmitoylated. Moreover, we have preliminary data indicating the Mnc1, the Cpp3 paralog, although not strictly a CYSTM protein, is also palmitoylated although it might bind to membranes differently. This highlights the need for a reassessment of the CYSTM/CYSPD family definition even further. More research is required to advance in this direction.</p><p>GFP tagging and microscopy have confirmed highthroughput data indicating that Cpp1, Cpp2 and Cpp3 are localized to the PM in a polarized manner. We show that this polarization depends on endocytosis and recycling. However, they are polarized to different extents, suggesting different efficiencies of their endocytosis signals or different rates of diffusion. It might be interesting to investigate this matter further. Perhaps, these different diffusion rates might be due to different palmitoylation patterns, that is, either more cysteines being palmitoylated or having different occupancies.</p><p>Reports both in yeast (3) and in plants ( <ref type="formula">9</ref>) suggested localizations other than the PM for some members of the CYSPD family. However, in both cases, proteins were tagged with GFP at the C terminus. Since the CYSPD is responsible for membrane binding, tagging in this region may interfere with the protein's localization. However, the CYSTM family is large and localizations other than the PM cannot be excluded.</p><p>We also present several lines of evidence to suggest that the CYSTM-containing proteins in yeast are not transmembrane as previously suggested (1) but instead are bound to membranes via S-acylation. The most direct strategy to demonstrate binding to the membranes via palmitoylation is to cleave the thioester bond by incubation with neutral HA. We showed that upon treatment of membrane fractions with this reagent, a significant amount of GFP-Cpp1-3 is released into the soluble fraction. The release is not complete, and this might be due to non-palmitoylated proteins being aggregated in vitro. This is consistent with the behavior of GFP-Cpp1 5xΔCys, which is also partially present in the soluble fraction; however, we cannot exclude other factors that may be keeping the proteins attached to membranes such as interacting partners. The non-transmembrane, palmitoylated protein SNAP25 can maintain membrane association in the absence of S-acylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. Nevertheless, bona fide transmembrane proteins such as Tlg1 are not released from the membranes by treatment with HA. The second line of evidence is provided by the treatments with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP. At low concentrations of this drug, we can see that GFP-Cpp1 is greatly affected, exhibiting some puncta and some soluble distribution, as is the positive control GFP-Yck2, while the negative control protein GFP-Sso1 is not. A higher concentration of 2-BP grossly affects the GFP-Sso1 control (not shown). This is to be expected since 2-BP is a very toxic inhibitor, known to affect multiple processes in the cell including membrane traffic (reviewed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref>).</p><p>Additional, indirect evidence for the non-transmembrane nature of these proteins stems from the fact that they are degraded via the proteasome since degradation is stopped by the addition of MG132, while most transmembrane proteins of the late secretory pathway are degraded in the vacuole.</p><p>If these proteins were tail-anchored transmembrane proteins, they should be inserted in the ER membrane by the GET complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> or the EMC complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>. Deletion of GET2 shows a striking effect on the localization of the tail-anchored proteins Sso1 and Snc1, while GFP-Cpp1 distribution remains completely unaffected, in these conditions or the absence of a functional EMC complex.</p><p>Finally, a compelling argument for the non-transmembrane nature of these proteins is the fact that when cysteines 110 and 114 are absent from the GFP-Cpp1 construct, the protein remains palmitoylated. The TMD model for Cpp1 CYSPD (1) indicates that the remaining cysteines (119, 121, and 122) would be buried deep into the membrane and hence not available for palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>. Cysteine 119, the closest to the cytoplasmic border available for palmitoylation in the C 110 114 A double mutant is predicted to be in position 12 from the cytosolic border (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). We have also analyzed a triple mutant C 110 114 119 A and the protein remains palmitoylated (not shown). This would be very unlikely if the CYSPD was indeed a transmembrane domain.</p><p>We next assessed the effect of the absence of individual yeast PATs on GFP-CYSPD proteins. We found a striking effect of deleting AKR1. The lack of this PAT led to the complete degradation of all CYSPD proteins analyzed. The deletion of ERF2 led to a partial degradation of Cpp1 and Cpp3. Degradation was far more pronounced for Cpp2.</p><p>Interestingly, when palmitoylation of Cpp1 is abolished by mutation of the cysteines, the protein forms aggregates inside the cell but it can be detected both by microscopy and Western blot. One possibility to explain this is that losing palmitoylation of a particular cysteine by deletion of Akr1 generates an incompletely palmitoylated species, which is more unstable than a mutant lacking all palmitates due to cysteine mutations. However, this does not appear to be the case, since single-cysteine mutants and a combination of double and triple mutants expressed in a WT strain, never recapitulate the complete degradation observed in akr1Δ. This led us to hypothesize that the loss of Akr1 might have an effect that is independent of the presence of a CYSPD domain and hence its palmitoylation status. We demonstrated this effect using constructs that either lacked the CYSPD domain or that had all the cysteines mutated to alanine and comparing the protein levels in WT and akr1Δ strains. The effect of the lack of Akr1 on the stability of CYSPD proteins is intriguing. Akr1 has multiple substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> and the loss of this protein leads to diminished growth and morphological phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. The metabolic state generated by the loss of this protein may be sensed by the cytoplasmic domains of CYSPD proteins, triggering their degradation. This might in the future lead to clues on the molecular function of CYSPD proteins. The effect could be due to either loss of function of a palmitoylated Akr1 substrate or gain of function of the nonpalmitoylated (or abnormally) palmitoylated substrate (or both), so a simple deletion analysis of Akr1 substrates might not be able to identify which Akr1 substrate is responsible. One way to single out Akr1 substrates involved in Cpps degradation is to use versions of these substrates whose palmitoylation is independent of Akr1, so they can remain "active" in its absence. One interesting candidate is Yck2, a casein kinase I homolog, involved in morphogenesis, proper septin assembly, endocytic trafficking, and glucose sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49)</ref>. We expressed Cpp1 in the strain NDY1953. This strain has a palmitoylationindependent allele of Yck2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> in which Yck2 can bind to membranes since it bears the C-terminal domain of Ras2, which is prenylated, and later palmitoylated by Erf2. In this strain, Cpp proteins are still completely degraded, suggesting that processes downstream Yck2 are not involved in Cpp1 degradation (not shown). Another interesting candidate is the Sphingoid long-chain base kinase Lcb4, responsible for the synthesis of long-chain base phosphates. The localization of this protein is dependent on Akr1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. Long-chain base phosphates in yeast are signaling molecules involved in multiple cellular processes, including resistance to heat-stress and Ca2+ mobilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref>.</p><p>The degradation of Cpp proteins mediated by the loss of Erf2 is, on the other hand, likely related to incomplete palmitoylation of the CYSPD.</p><p>We have shown that the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 has a role in the degradation of CYSPD proteins, which may lead to significant insights into the molecular function of these proteins.</p><p>Our mutational analysis indicates that no single cysteine is crucial for stability, suggesting that more than one cysteine is palmitoylated in the steady state. The double and triple mutants analyzed in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref> indicate that at least two cysteines are modified. We carried out acyl-PEG exchange experiments to try to resolve this issue. In this technique, palmitates are exchanged by five kDa PEG molecules, leading to shifts in the molecular weight, for each palmitoylated cysteine. We found shifts that corresponded to either two palmitoylated cysteines and a more minoritarian shift, indicating four palmitoylated cysteines (not shown). However, we are not confident that cysteines that are next to each other in a sequence can be efficiently detected by this technique due to steric hindrance. A definitive model for the steady-state palmitoylation of CYSPD proteins will require specialized mass spectrometry studies and a detailed mutagenic analysis of the domain.</p><p>The molecular mode of action of these proteins remains mysterious; it has been hypothesized that the cysteines present in the domain would chelate metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. However, some or most of these cysteines are likely palmitoylated and therefore unavailable for the chelation of metals. The mechanisms by which these proteins may contribute to resistance to stress caused by metals remain to be uncovered. A deeper understanding of these proteins' topology is a first and necessary step toward understanding their function.</p></div>

C, fluorescence microscopy images of GFP-Cpp1 expressed in erg6Δ and akr1Δ erg6Δ strains in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Degradation of GFP-Cpp1 is prevented by the proteasome inhibitor. Experiments are carried out in an erg6Δ background to improve permeability to the drug. The scale bar represents 2 μm. D, scatter plot graph showing the fluorescence intensity average ± SD of GFP-Cpp1 in the double mutant akr1Δ erg6Δ strain, measured in the presence or absence of MG132. Each average value was relativized to the average fluorescence intensity of the control cells erg6Δ (n = 20). a. u: arbitrary units; CPP, cysteine-rich palmitoylated protein; PAT, palmitoyltransferase; RFI, relative fluorescence intensity.</figDesc><graphic coords="7,382.85,375.19,139.52,194.77" type="bitmap" /></figure>

A, fluorescence microscopy images of GFP-Cpp1 expressed in WT (upper panel), akr1Δ (middle panel), and akr1Δ rsp5hm (lower panel) strains. In the absence of Akr1, the expression and localization of GFP-Cpp1 are rescued by lowering the levels of Rsp5. The scale bar represents 2 μm. B, acyl-biotin exchange assay of GFP-Cpp1 expressed in WT and akr1Δ rsp5hm strains, showing that the protein remains palmitoylated when degradation is precluded. C, Western blot analysis showing the expression levels of GFP-Cpp1 in WT and indicated mutant strains. GFP-Cpp1 is partially degraded in erf2Δ, completely degraded in akr1Δ and this degradation is partially precluded in akr1Δ rsp5hm strain. Tlg1 was used as a loading control.
