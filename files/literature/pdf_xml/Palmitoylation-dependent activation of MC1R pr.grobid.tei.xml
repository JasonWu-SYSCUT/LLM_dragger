<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a G protein-coupled receptor, plays a crucial role in human and mouse pigmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> .

Individuals carrying MC1R variants, especially those associated with red hair color, fair skin and poor tanning ability (RHC-variants), are associated with higher risk of melanoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . However, how MC1R activity might be modulated by UV irradiation, why redheads are more prone to developing melanoma, and whether the activity of RHC variants might be restored for therapeutic benefit remain unresolved questions. Here we demonstrate a potential MC1R-targeted intervention strategy to rescue loss-of-function MC1R in MC1R RHC-variants for therapeutic benefit based on activating MC1R protein palmitoylation. Specifically, MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase (PAT) ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signaling that triggers increased pigmentation, UVBinduced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Using C57BL/6J-MC1R e/e J mice expressing MC1R RHC-variants we show that pharmacological activation of palmitoylation rescues the defects of MC1R RHC-variants and prevents melanomagenesis. The results highlight a central role for MC1R palmitoylation in pigmentation and protection against melanoma.</p><p>A preliminary small molecule screen to identify novel modulators of RHC-variant MC1R activity suggested that palmitic acid increased cAMP levels in human primary melanocytes with an endogenous MC1R R151C variant (HPM-RHC), or engineered RHC-variant B16 melanoma cells (B16-RHC) in which MC1R R151C was reintroduced after deletion of the endogenous gene (MC1R reconstituted cells). To validate this result, HPM-RHC and B16-RHC were serum starved, pretreated with α-MSH and exposed to one standard erythema dose of UVB (100 J/m 2 ), before being treated with medium containing BSA-conjugated fatty acids for 3 h. Palmitic acid, but not other lipids, increased cAMP levels in both HPM-RHC and B16-RHC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1a</ref>).</p><p>Since palmitic acid can induce palmitoylation of cysteine residues (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>) we treated cells with the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP (2-bromopalmitate). 2-BP prevented palmitic acid-induced cAMP levels in both HPM-RHC and B16-RHC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c</ref>) as well as in WT B16 and HPMs, with the effect of palmitic acid being dependent on α-MSH and stimulated by UV irradiation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1d-e</ref>). Using an acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay in HPM-RHCs (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1f</ref>), free cysteine thiol groups were irreversibly blocked by N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), palmitoylated cysteines exposed by hydroxylamine (HAM) and biotinylated. Labeled proteins pulled down using streptavidin-dynabeads were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g</ref>) to reveal that MC1R is palmitoylated (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1h</ref>), consistent with integral membrane proteins G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like MC1R <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> being palmitoylated during activation. Palmitoylation site prediction (NBA-palm) analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> highlighted MC1R Cysteines 78 and 315 as potential palmitoylation sites (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1i-k</ref>).</p><p>Palmitoylation of both endogenous MC1R and exogenously expressed Flag-MC1R was confirmed using streptavidin to detect MC1R protein labeled using ABE following immunoprecipitation from B16 and HPMs stimulated with α-MSH (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1c-d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a-b</ref>). The Flag-MC1R C78S mutant but not Flag-MC1R C315S was also palmitoylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1e</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>), indicating that C315 is the major MC1R palmitoylation site.</p><p>Using MC1R reconstituted cells, in the presence of α-MSH both R151C and R160W MC1R variants exhibited reduced palmitoylation compared to WT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1f</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>). Moreover, a C315S mutation in the context of the R151C variant completely blocked MC1R R151C palmitoylation, indicating Cys151 is not a neo-palmitoylation site (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e-f</ref>). Notably UVR-stimulated palmitoylation of endogenous MC1R and exogenously expressed Flag-MC1R (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1g-h</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2g-h</ref>), but not the MC1R C315S mutant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1i</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2i</ref>), whereas UVR-induced palmitoylation of the R151C and R160W RHC-variants was reduced compared to the WT protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1j</ref>-k and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2j-m</ref>).</p><p>To identify which protein S-acyl transferases (PATs) were responsible for MC1R modification, 23 HA-tagged ZDHHC PATs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> were co-expressed with Flag-MC1R. Detectable MC1R palmitoylation was only observed following expression of ZDHHC2, 3, 7, 13 and 17 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>), with ZDHHC13 the most efficient (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>). MC1R palmitoylation was substantially reduced in cells expressing a C456S mutant ZDHHC13 in which the enzymatic DQHC motif was mutated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>). Silencing ZDHHC13 diminished UVR-stimulated palmitoylation of WT MC1R (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2c</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c</ref>), as well as the R151C RHC variant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d</ref>), whereas ZDHHC13 overexpression activated MC1R R151C palmitoylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3d-f</ref>). The MC1R C315S mutant was used as a negative control.</p><p>Interaction between ZDHHC13 and MC1R was detected by co-immunoprecipitation from α-MSH-treated HPMs and was enhanced by UVR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e</ref>), reflecting increased MC1R palmitoylation following UVR (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3g-h</ref>). Interaction between the MC1R RHC R151C and R160W proteins and ZDHHC13 was also increased after UVR, but was much less than with WT MC1R (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>).</p><p>Since ATR is a central effector of the UVB-response <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> we asked if ATR-mediated phosphorylation of ZDHHC13 promoted MC1R palmitoylation following UV exposure. HPMs expressing HA-ZDHHC13 were irradiated with UVB and after anti-HA immunoprecipitation phosphorylation of ZDHHC13 was detected by with specific phospho-S/T-Q antibody. The results revealed UVB treatment increased ZDHHC13 phosphorylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2g</ref>) and MC1R-ZDHHC13 interaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2h</ref>) that was substantially reduced in cells stably expressing shATR (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2i</ref>). Mutation of an evolutionarily conserved SQ site at Ser8 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3i</ref>) prevented UVR-stimulated ZDHHC13 phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3j</ref>) and ATR WT, but not a kinase-dead mutant, robustly phosphorylated recombinant WT ZDHHC13, but not the S8A mutant (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3k</ref>). Compared to WT ZDHHC13, the S8A mutant only weakly interacted with MC1R (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3l</ref>) and failed to enhance MC1R palmitoylation upon UVB irradiation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3m</ref>). Collectively these results suggest that ZDHHC13 phosphorylation by ATR following UVB irradiation promotes its interaction with MC1R to stimulate MC1R palmitoylation.</p><p>To test whether MC1R palmitoylation regulates MC1R signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> cAMP levels were measured after UVB irradiation and α-MSH stimulation of MC1R reconstituted cells. Whereas WT MC1R significantly increased cAMP levels following UVR, the palmitoylation-deficient mutant C315S failed to do so, and RHC variants partially lost their ability to stimulate cAMP production (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>). The C315S mutant also failed to up-regulate microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and tyrosinase (TYR) mRNA expression (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b-c</ref>) downstream from MC1R signaling. The MC1R RHC variants only weakly activated MITF and TYR expression compared to WT, strongly suggesting that palmitoylation is essential for MC1R signaling.</p><p>To examine the role of MC1R palmitoylation in α-MSH/MC1R-regulated DNA repair, endogenous MC1R reconstituted HPMs and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPs) were measured following UVB exposure. Although WT MC1R promoted photoproduct clearance, the palmitoylation-defective C315S mutant, or the RHC variants failed to repair the lesions efficiently (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4d</ref>).</p><p>Consistent with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> silencing MC1R augments low dose UVB-induced premature senescence that was bypassed by reintroduction of WT MC1R (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4e</ref>). The R151C and R160W RHC variants also exhibited a defective senescence bypass phenotype whereas the C315S mutant was ineffective (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4f</ref>). Using engineered human immortal melanocytes (hTERT/p53DD/CDK4(R24C) melanocytes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> in colony formation and soft agar growth assays we found that BRAF V600E -mediated cellular transformation was suppressed by WT MC1R, but not the C315S mutant, while the R151C and R160W variants exhibited an intermediate phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4g-k</ref>).</p><p>To examine its role in cAMP production, ZDHHC13 was silenced or overexpressed in MC1R reconstituted B16 cells and HPMs, and cAMP levels measured following UVB irradiation and α-MSH stimulation. ZDHHC13 overexpression increased cAMP levels in cells expressing WT MC1R and also rescued the defect in cAMP production in cells expressing the R151C variant (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>). ZDHHC13 overexpression increased MITF expression in WT cells and rescued the defect in α-MSH/MC1R RHC variantinduced MITF up-regulation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>). The palmitoylation defective C315S mutant was inactive irrespective of ZDHHC13 expression. ZDHHC13 overexpression enhanced UVR-induced DNA damage repair and rescued the defect in photoproduct clearance in melanocytes with the MC1R R151C variant, whereas ZDHHC13 depletion impaired repair (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5c</ref>). Similarly, ZDHHC13 overexpression protected against UVB-induced premature senescence in melanocytes expressing WT and R151C MC1R, but not those expressing the C315S mutant, whereas shRNA depletion of ZDHHC13 enhanced senescence in cells expressing WT or R151C MC1R (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>).</p><p>Soft agar and colony formation assays using the human hTERT/p53DD/CDK4(R24C) melanocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> revealed that ZDHHC13 depletion increased transformation by BRAF V600E in the presence of WT MC1R, whereas enhanced transformation by the R151C mutant was suppressed by ZDHHC13 overexpression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5e</ref>). Elevated transformation in the presence of the C315S mutant was unaffected by ZDHHC13 overexpression/depletion. Subcutaneous xenograft tumor assays also indicated that ZDHHC13 overexpression inhibits MC1R R151C-augmented BRAF V600E -induced malignant transformation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3c-e</ref>).</p><p>We next used MC1R loss-of-function (C57BL/6J-MC1R e/e J) mice, backcrossed to C57BL/6 for more than 24 generations, to generate transgenics re-expressing melanocyte-specific WT, RHC variant and C315S mutant MC1R (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6a</ref>). Unlike previous transgenic MC1R RHC mice developed by Healy et al 3 using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC), our MC1R R151C variant offspring show a mosaic coat color that could arise as a consequence of the promoter used, integration site, or mouse strain background. Our other RHC-variants exhibited a paler coat color than WT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4a</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6b</ref>). All mice are at generation F26 or later with stable fur phenotypes and exhibit similar expression levels of the human transgenic MC1R mRNAs (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6c</ref>). The MC1R R151C variant mice also exhibit higher skin pheomelanin/eumelanin ratios than WT mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>). Strikingly, the palmitoylation-deficient MC1R C315S-espressing mice showed a similar coat color and skin pheomelanin content to the C57BL/6J-MC1R e/e J mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4b</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6b</ref>), with no significant difference in number/distribution/location of melanocytes detected in mice with MC1R +/+ , MC1R e/e , MC1R R151C and MC1R C315S (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6d-e</ref>).</p><p>Tyr-Cre-BRAF CA mice (B6.Cg-Braf tm1Mmcm Tg(Tyr-cre/ERT2)13Bos/BosJ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> were next crossed to the MC1R e/e , MC1R +/+ , MC1R R151C and MC1R C315S mice and BRAF V600E expression induced by tamoxifen administration. After UVB irradiation each week for four weeks (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">5f</ref>) melanomas developed early and frequently in MC1R loss-offunction (e/e) or palmitoylation-defective MC1R transgenic (C315S) mice, much later with WT MC1R mice, and at an intermediate time with the MC1R R151C variant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4c</ref>). All melanomas diagnosed displayed similar morphological and histologic features (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">6g</ref>).</p><p>To explore whether MC1R palmitoylation is dynamic, we removed α-MSH from the culture medium and found that palmitoylation disappeared within 12 h, while Palm-B, a deacylating enzyme inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , blocked both WT and R151C MC1R depalmitoylation (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>), suggesting that Palm-B enhances MC1R palmitoylation. Treatment of endogenous MC1R reconstituted B16 cells with Palm-B, together with α-MSH and UVB irradiation, increased MC1R R151C palmitoylation to levels detected for the WT protein, whereas no palmitoylation was observed using the C315S mutant irrespective of Palm-B administration (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>). Using HPMs or B16 cells reconstituted with WT or variant MC1R, Palm-B moderately increased α-MSH-induced cAMP production, but dramatically increased signaling from the R151C variant to levels comparable to those observed from α-MSH-stimulated WT MC1R in the absence of Palm-B (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>). Signaling downstream from the R151C variant, as well as WT MC1R, was functional since both MITF and TYR mRNA expression were upregulated by Palm-B (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7d-e</ref>). Palm-B also accelerated clearance of UVR-induced photoproducts in melanocytes with the MC1R R151C variant (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7f</ref>). By performing ABE on extracts from mouse skin irradiated with UVB we confirmed that Palm-B administration to mice increased MC1R palmitoylation in MC1R R151C and MC1R +/+ in vivo (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7g</ref>). Following UVB treatment, both CPD and 6-4pp DNA lesions were significantly higher in R151C mice than in WT mice, with Palm-B reducing the levels of damage detected in both (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7h-i</ref>). Notably, Palm-B also repressed lowdose UVB-induced premature senescence in HPMs or B16 cells reconstituted with the MC1R R151C variant (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7j</ref>). Using human immortal hTERT/p53DD/ CDK4(R24C) melanocytes Palm-B largely reversed the increased colony formation observed using the R151C variant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4d</ref>, Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7k</ref>) and in xenograft studies, Palm-B inhibited MC1R R151C-augmented BRAF V600E melanomagenesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4e-g</ref>). Importantly, Palm-B had no effect in any assay using the C315S mutant.</p><p>Finally, to confirm the preventive effect of Palm-B in melanomagenesis in redheads, Tyr-Cre-BRAF CA -MC1R e/e -MC1R R151C mice were UVB irradiated each week for four weeks, with 10 mg/kg Palm-B injected intraperitoneally into Tyr-Cre-BRAF CA -MC1R e/e -MC1R R151C mice prior to the treatment with UV. While no strong side effects were observed, in Palm-B treated mice melanomagenesis was substantially delayed and the incidence reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4h</ref>). Similar results were obtained using Palm-B and the MC1R R160W variant (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Collectively our results highlight a central role for MC1R palmitoylation in protecting against melanoma, and suggest that rescuing MC1R palmitoylation by up-regulation of ZDHHC13 or inhibition of depalmitoylation might be a potential clinical prevention strategy for melanoma in redheads.</p></div>

All cell lines were authenticated and mycoplasma negative. Briefly, cells were washed by PBS twice before UVB irradiation. For the in vitro UV experiments, cells were exposed to ultraviolet radiation in the Stratalinker UV chamber (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX, USA) with UVB bulbs (UVP LLC, Upland, CA, USA). UV emittance was measured with the use of a UV photometer (UVP LLC, Upland, CA, USA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . Adherent cells were irradiated through a small volume of PBS at a dose of 100 J/m 2 . A UVB dose of 100 J/m 2 is equivalent to one standard erythema dose of UVB (SED), commonly used as a measurement of sunlight. As a reference, the ambient exposure over an entire sunny summer day in Europe (Switzerland) is approximately 30-40 SED <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . Human primary melanocytes were isolated from normal discarded foreskins as described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> and were cultured in Medium 254 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). In all assays, cells were pretreated with α-MSH (1 μM) for 30 min following with 100 J/m 2 UVB irradiation, and collected 3 h after UVB exposure. Palm B was used at 1 μM.</p><p>The maximal tumor size is 20 mm at the largest diameter, which was permitted by IACUC of Boston University Medical Campus. None of the experiments exceeded the limit. Mice were maintained in specific-pathogen-free facility of Animal Science Center (ASC) of Boston University Medical Campus, and the experiments were performed according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Boston University Medical Campus. Mice were housed on a time cycle of 12 h of light (beginning at 6:00 AM) and 12 h of dark (beginning at 6:00 PM). Mice were allowed free access to an irradiated diet and sterilized water. The mice were monitored daily for signs of health status and distress. Mice with age from 8 weeks to 6 months were used for breeding and pregnant female will be placed in a new cage. Mice were weaned at 20 -21 days of age. DNA was extracted from the mouse tail biopsy for genotyping. NCr nude mice (female, 8-10 weeks) were purchased from Taconic Biosciences. C57BL/6J-MC1R e/e J (The Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 000060) homozygous mice were crossed with Tyr-Cre-BRAF CA mice (B6.Cg-Braf tm1Mmcm Tg(Tyrcre/ERT2)13Bos/BosJ) (The Jackson Laboratory, Stock No: 017837) homozygous mice to generate Tyr-Cre-BRAF CA -MC1R +/e heterozygous mice, which were crossed to generate the age-matched C57BL/6J-Tyr-Cre-BRAF CA -MC1R +/+ mice and C57BL/6J-Tyr-Cre-BRAF CA -MC1R e/e for experiments. All these mice are genotyped according to The Jackson Laboratory's protocol. All mice are with stable fur phenotypes at generation F26 or later.</p><p>Transgenic mice were designed to express melanocyte-specific MC1R RHC-variant (controlled by the Tyr enhancer/promoter) and generated by Boston University School of Medicine Transgenic and Genome Engineering Core. The expression construct was designed such that the MC1R gene was inserted downstream of the murine tyrosinase locus control region. Each construct was injected into single-cell embryos of C57BL/6J-MC1R e/e J mice. The transgene was detected by genotyping mice tail DNA using the primers targeting fragment across Tyr promoter and MC1R region (~1200 bp, forward 5′-GGGCTATGTACAAACTCCAAGA′-3, reverse 5′-ACACTTAAAGCGCGTGCACCGC-′3). The expression levels of human transgene were determined as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Briefly, total RNA was collected from primary melanocytes isolated from neonatal transgenic mouse skins using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). A sequential DNA remove was performed by DNA-free™ DNA Removal Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) to avoid genomic DNA contamination. Reverse transcription was carried out with random primers. Primers were used as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> to amplify both the mouse and human MC1R. A following extension was performed using primer as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> by adding ddTTP (mouse MC1R) or ddCTP (human MC1R) (SNaPshot Multiplex Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Extension products were separated by capillary electrophoresis and quantified by measuring human/mouse MC1R ratio. Mice underwent tamoxifen treatment to express BRAF V600E in melanocytes. Briefly, mice at 3 weeks of age were administered with tamoxifen (T5648) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in corn oil daily by intraperitoneal injection at 0.12 mg/g body weight for 5 consecutive days. The control mice will get plain corn oil injection. Mouse UV exposure procedure was performed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . Briefly, a UVB dose of 500 J/m 2 was used. This does is equivalent to one minimum erythema dose of UVB (MED) and 5 standard erythema doses of UVB (SED), commonly used as a measurement of sunlight in vivo.</p></div>
