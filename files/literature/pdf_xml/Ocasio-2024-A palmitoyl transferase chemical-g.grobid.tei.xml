<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The 23 human zinc finger Asp-His-His-Cys motif-containing (ZDHHC) S-acyltransferases catalyze long-chain S-acylation at cysteine residues across an extensive network of hundreds of proteins important for normal physiology or dysregulated in disease. Here we present a technology to directly map the protein substrates of a specific ZDHHC at the whole-proteome level, in intact cells. Structure-guided engineering of paired ZDHHC 'hole' mutants and 'bumped' chemically tagged fatty acid probes enabled probe transfer to specific protein substrates with excellent selectivity over wild-type ZDHHCs. Chemical-genetic systems were exemplified for five human ZDHHCs (3, 7, 11, 15 and 20) and applied to generate de novo ZDHHC substrate profiles, identifying &gt;300 substrates and S-acylation sites for new functionally diverse proteins across multiple cell lines. We expect that this platform will elucidate S-acylation biology for a wide range of models and organisms.</p><p>The chemical and functional diversity of proteins encoded by the human genome is expanded by orders of magnitude through post-translational modification (PTM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> , of which long-chain S-acylation is among the most widespread. This process is mediated in all eukaryotes by the zinc finger Asp-His-His-Cys motif-containing (ZDHHC) S-acyltransferase family of integral membrane enzymes, including 23 known human ZDHHCs that together acylate &gt;3,000 cysteine residues across ca. 12% of the human proteome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . The ZDHHC catalytic cycle occurs in the following two stages: auto-S-acylation of a conserved Cys in the DHHC motif by C14:0 to C22:0 acyl-CoA (commonly palmitoyl (C16:0)-CoA) with release of CoA-SH, followed by S-acyl transfer to a substrate protein cysteine proximal to the ZDHHC catalytic site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1a</ref>,b) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> . Protein substrates lack a consensus sequence beyond the requirement for a free cysteine <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , and substrate recruitment occurs through colocalization by ZDHHC-protein interactions, membrane-associated domains or prior lipid PTMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . S-acylation increases local hydrophobicity and membrane affinity and can regulate protein membrane microdomain partitioning, stability, trafficking, nuclear localization, secretion and protein interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . De-S-acylation by acyl-protein thioesterase (APT; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1a</ref>) can generate a dynamic S-acylation cycle implicated in signaling cascades <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , with numerous examples of upregulation or downregulation of S-acylation promoting pathological conditions including cancer, inflammatory disease or neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> .</p><p>Despite the importance of ZDHHCs in health and disease, mapping the substrate network of a specific ZDHHC remains a formidable challenge. Global enrichment of S-acylated proteins through metabolic labeling with alkyne-tagged lipid analogs or chemical exchange of S-acyl thioesters for affinity tags can circumvent the difficulty of direct S-acylated peptide detection by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), leading to large databases of putative substrate https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-02030-0 networks for ZDHHCs 7, 15 and 20. Adaptability and ease of implementation across cellular models suggest that ZDHHC chemical genetics offers a new platform for systematic investigation of ZDHHC biology, with the potential to catalyze knowledge-driven selection of ZDHHCs and ZDHHC-mediated pathways for future therapeutic validation or biomarker discovery.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selective S-acylation by an engineered ZDHHC20/probe pair</head><p>Steric complementation imposes stringent requirements on mutant and probe design, which are as follows: mutant ZDHHC should retain WT catalytic activity and protein substrate specificity; the probe must bear both a 'bump' and a bioorthogonal tag <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> and be efficiently activated to the CoA thioester form in the cell, without interfering with endogenous lipid metabolism; the activated probe must be minimally processed proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . However, the lack of selective ZDHHC inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and the confounding influence of ZDHHC overexpression, knockdown or knockout (KO) that can lead to redundancy, compensation or loss of ZDHHC-protein interactions and coregulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> currently prevent the direct association of a specific ZDHHC with its cognate S-acylated protein substrates.</p><p>Here we establish a chemical-genetic system for direct labeling and identification of the substrates of a specific ZDHHC in intact cells, through steric complementation (so-called 'bump and hole'; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> . We report mutant/probe pairs for five diverse human ZDHHCs (3, 7,  11, 15 and 20) and demonstrate mutant-specific ZDHHC-loading and protein substrate transfer with high selectivity over wild-type (WT) ZDHHCs. Coupled with chemical proteomics, this technology enabled de novo identification of &gt;300 putative ZDHHC-specific substrates and S-acylation sites in varied human cell lines and extended substrate https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-02030-0 by WT ZDHHCs to deliver selectivity for ZDHHC-specific substrate identification. Human ZDHHCs feature a conical four multipass transmembrane (4TM) helix lipid-binding domain adjacent to the cytosolic catalytic site <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Reasoning that mutations distal to the DHHC active site would minimize interference with catalytic activity and lipid probe activation, we used the reported structure of ZDHHC20 to design 'hole' mutations toward the 4TM apex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1c</ref>). A panel of nine alkyne-tagged bumped lipid analogs were designed and synthesized, positioning small Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> | Engineering a 'bump' probe and 'hole' mutant pair for ZDHHC20. a, Fatty acid probes containing an alkynyl click-handle (blue), varying chain length L = 16, 18 or 20 heavy atoms in the chain (carbons + nitrogen) and an R 'bump' group (red)-Ac, cPr or Bz. b, Two-stage pairing strategy for a designed ZDHHC20 mutant optimizes probe chain length and then bump size to match the new binding cavity, with probe activation, selectivity over ZDHHC20 WT and transfer to a known ZDHHC20 substrate (IFITM3) optimized in parallel. c-f, Bump-hole loading analysis of C-terminal FLAG-tagged ZDHHC20 WT and mutants in HEK293T cells treated with 15 μM YnPal (c,d) or 18-Ac (e,f) for 4 h (D, catalytic-dead ZDHHC20(C156S); E, empty vector; n = 3 independent biological replicates average ± s.d.). g, Probe bump-size optimization by transfer assays with HA-IFITM3 and either WT ZDHHC20 (W) or ZDHHC20(Y181G) (M) co-expression in HEK293T cells (n = 3 independent biological replicates average ± s.d.). h, Average loading and transfer activity relative to highest fluorescent/input ratio (n = 3 independent biological replicates average ± s.d.). i,j, Enzyme kinetics for WT ZDHHC20 and ZDHHC20(Y181G) treated with Pal-CoA (i) or 18-Bz-CoA (j) using a KDH assay (3).

This design enables systematic bump pairing to ZDHHC mutant 'hole' size and position, while the bioorthogonal alkyne tag permits ligation of fluorescent reporters and/or affinity handles to modified proteins by copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1c</ref>), revealing ZDHHC autoacylation and substrates in cellular assays. Probe/ mutant optimization was envisaged in two stages, determining bump placement followed by optimal bump size (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</p><p>Baseline autoacylation activity for each FLAG-tagged ZDHHC20 mutant was determined by metabolic labeling with YnPal (an alkyne-tagged analog of palmitate, C16:0) in HEK293T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by CuAAC ligation to tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) and analysis by in-gel fluorescence confirmed autoacylation activity for all mutants, with ZDHHC20(Y181G) showing labeling equivalent to WT. Residual acylation for catalytically dead Cys mutant ZDHHC20(C156S) (lane 'D'; Fig. <ref type="figure">2c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>) was consistent with previously characterized S-acylation at noncatalytic ZDHHC20 Cys residues mediated by endogenous ZDHHCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . Labeling was sensitive to thioester cleavage by hydroxylamine (HA) and increased with YnPal concentration and incubation time, leading to steady-state labeling after 2 h of incubation with 15 μM YnPal (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1a-h</ref>). An initial screen of ZDHHC20 mutants under similar conditions against bumped probe 18-Ac (18-atom chain length, smallest bump) revealed strong complementation for F65 and Y181 mutants and reduced loading with WT ZDHHC20, with Y181G exhibiting fivefold higher loading than WT (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). Furthermore, residual ZDHHC20(C156S) labeling was suppressed to the background, suggesting that the bumped probe is a poor substrate for endogenous ZDHHCs that S-acylate ZDHHC20 in trans. These data, consistent with previous evidence that mutations in the 4TM domain can tolerate longer chain lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , encouraged us to proceed to optimize steric complementation with ZDHHC20(Y181G).</p><p>Structure-guided screening commenced with the smallest 'bump' probes of increasing chain length (16-Ac, 18-Ac or 20-Ac) to identify the length register matching the bump to the mutant cavity (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>). Both lipid loading and transfer to the substrate were assayed together by co-expressing ZDHHC20-FLAG (WT or Y181G) with HA-tagged canonical ZDHHC20 substrate IFITM3 (refs. 21,37), enabling sensitive in-gel fluorescence quantification of ZDHHC20 and protein substrate labeling following dual FLAG/HA IP and on-bead CuAAC ligation to TAMRA-azide. Chain lengths 18-Ac and 20-Ac were superior to 16-Ac in ZDHHC20(Y181G) loading, with 18-Ac showing twofold higher transfer over 20-Ac (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1k,</ref><ref type="figure">l</ref>), implying improved catalytic efficiency. Bump-size screening (Ac, cPr or Bz) at the 18-atom length identified 18-Bz as an optimal probe for ZDHHC20(Y181G), exhibiting &gt;20-fold higher loading and &gt;60-fold more efficient transfer than WT ZDHHC20 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2g,</ref><ref type="figure">h</ref>).</p></div>

Consistent with cellular assay data, YnPal-CoA had similar catalytic efficiency (k cat /K M ) for WT and ZDHHC20(Y181G) (6.8 ± 0.3 and 7.6 ± 0.3 μM min -1 , respectively; Fig. <ref type="figure">2i</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Furthermore, 18-Bz-CoA had even greater catalytic efficiency with ZDHHC20(Y181G) (16.0 ± 1.0 μM min -1 ), with slightly reduced k cat and K M relative to YnPal-CoA, while showing no measurable activity with WT ZDHHC20 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2j</ref> and Supplementary Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). As expected, catalytically dead ZDHHC20(C156S) and (Y181G/C156S) mutants were inactive in this assay (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Together, these data provide compelling biochemical evidence that designed ZDHHC steric complementation delivers orthogonal ZDHHC loading at an efficiency comparable to WT.</p></div>

Loading and transfer selectivity for 18-Bz/ZDHHC20(Y181G) over 18-Bz/WT ZDHHC20 were optimized with respect to probe concentration (15 μM 18-Bz) and time (8 h; Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). Direct 18-Bz to 18-Bz-CoA conversion in cells was confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of extracted metabolites, while lipidomic analyses revealed 18-cPr and 18-Bz incorporation into structural and storage lipids consistent with in situ activation to the CoA ester, and no significant perturbation of endogenous lipid classes relative to vehicle or YnPal-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that transfected ZDHHC20(Y181G) and WT ZDHHC20 colocalize primarily in the Golgi and plasma membrane (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>), consistent with previously reported data on ZDHHC20 cellular localization that also used overexpression constructs due to the absence of reliable antibodies for imaging endogenous ZDHHC20 (refs. 39,40).</p><p>We sought to discover substrates modified by ZDHHC20(Y181G) de novo through comparative quantitative MS-based analysis of proteins labeled by 18-Bz in HEK293T cells expressing either ZDHHC20(Y181G) or WT ZDHHC20 (ref. 24), combined with on-bead thioester hydrolysis (OBH) and differential cysteine capping for S-acylation site identification (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3a</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> .

IP using anti-FLAG or anti-HA beads showed that only active ZDHHC20(Y181G) is loaded with 18-Bz and can transfer probe to the HA-tagged inactive counterpart, confirming auto-S-acylation of ZDHHC20 in trans (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficient substrate profiling at low ZDHHC mutant expression</head><p>We reasoned that ZDHHC overexpression would maximize sensitivity, and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>) and recapitulation of endogenous substrates and S-acylation sites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) suggest limited distortion of overexpression on substrate profiles. Nevertheless, overexpression has the potential to drive non-native ZDHHC localization and substrate interactions, and we sought to determine whether chemical-genetic substrate profiling could be achieved at tightly regulated and reduced expression levels. We established a panel of stable Flp-In T-REx HEK293 lines in which a ZDHHC20 construct is integrated at a single locus under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter, enabling fine control of WT or Y181G ZDHHC20 expression to an identical level in the same background (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>) and at ca. eightfold reduced expression relative to ectopic overexpression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6i</ref>).</p><p>Consistent with data from overexpression, 18-Bz was incorporated on induction of ZDHHC20(Y181G) expression at the whole-proteome https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-02030-0 level (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>) and into HA-tagged Ifitm3 with excellent selectivity over WT ZDHHC20 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref>). Selective quantitative enrichment of ZDHHC20(Y181G) substrates over WT was achieved on induction, covering a similar range of enrichment (up to 100-fold) as for ectopic expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref> and Supplementary Data 4). Consistent with reduced ZDHHC abundance, enrichment under inducible expression featured fewer hits overall than with ectopic overexpression (43 versus 214); &gt;80% of hits were conserved between analyses with improved significance of enrichment in the inducible system (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">8</ref>), suggesting a promising approach for future studies. Selective chemical-genetic labeling of multiple endogenous substrates was also observed in the inducible system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5e,</ref><ref type="figure">f</ref>). Overall, these data show that chemical-genetic labeling remains selective and efficient at greatly reduced ZDHHC20 expression level, permitting selection of either inducible or ectopic expression depending on the system. However, labeling in a HEK293T cell line bearing a Y181G knock-in mutation at the endogenous locus by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing did not enrich substrates at the level of endogenous ZDHHC20(Y181G) expression in HEK cells, suggesting a direction for future optimization (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemical genetics enhances specificity and sensitivity</head><p>ZDHHC20 substrates identified through chemical genetics were next compared with conventional substrate identification approaches, including chemical proteomic analyses in ZDHHC20 KO cell lines and interactome analyses by proximity labeling using TurboID-fused ZDHHC20 (ref. 45). No changes were apparent between two clonal ZDHHC20 KO HEK293T cell lines generated by CRIPSR/Cas9 versus WT cells in either Ifitm3 S-acylation by western blot or chemical proteomic analyses of S-acylated proteins using YnPal, with approximately equal numbers of enriched or depleted proteins (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> and Supplementary Data 5). Quantitative interactome analyses of either N-or C-terminal ZDHHC20 TurboID fusions versus TurboID-GFP in HEK293T cells together identified only five known ZDHHC20 substrates, consistent with the common observation that transferase substrates are not typically strong interactors (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemical-genetic systems across diverse ZDHHC family members</head><p>We next generated models for the 4TM helices defining the lipid-binding pocket and catalytic domain of the remaining 22 human ZDHHCs using human ZDHHC20 as a template, to identify suitable residues for mutagenesis and activity studies (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . We prioritized bulky residues buried in rigid hydrophobic pockets aligning to ZDHHC20 Tyr181 over mutations on flexible loops or potentially destabilizing mutations at the helix-bilayer boundary because these are more likely to present suitable sites for steric complementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> .</p><p>Our structure predictions for the 4TM lipid-binding core in the 6TM ZDHHCs 13 and 17 were well-correlated with AlphaFold predictions, with root-mean-square deviations of 1.5 and 1.7 Å, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> . We generated Ala, Gly or double mutant constructs for each human ZDHHC and subjected them to the same two-stage screening strategy used for ZDHHC20 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a</ref>).</p><p>For several ZDHHCs, Gly mutation resulted in dramatically decreased expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>), which in some cases could be restored by switching from Gly to a structurally more conservative Ala mutation or by adding strategically designed rescue mutations. For example, M181A in place of M181G improved ZDHHC11 expression, potentially by restoring backbone rigidity. ZDHHC15(Y184G) was also only modestly expressed; the reported crystal structure of zebrafish ZDHHC15 showed Ser35 hydrogen bonding to Tyr184, suggesting that Y184G may expose the Ser35 hydroxyl to the lipid-binding pocket. In support of this hypothesis, replacement of Ser35 with a less polar residue in a ZDHHC15(Y184G/S35C) double mutant improved expression. We identified several probes in the length screen displaying either selectivity or similar loading capacity for mutant versus WT ZDHHC; for example, 20-Ac was selectively loaded by ZDHHC3(I182G) and by ZDHHC15(Y184G/S35C), while 16-Ac was selectively loaded by ZDHHC11(M181A). Further refinement of probe selectivity for mutant over WT ZDHHC through bump screening at the optimal chain length led to the discovery of the following four additional optimized mutant/probe pairs: ZDHHC3(I182G)/20-cPr, ZDHHC7(L57G)/20-Bz, ZDHHC11(M181A)/16-cPr and ZDHHC15(Y184G)/20-cPr (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6a-c</ref> and Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>), following optimization of expression to match WT ZDHHC. The thioester linkage introduced by these systems was further confirmed by labeling analysis with and without HA (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure">9i</ref>). Taken together these data demonstrate that structure-guided design can expand chemical genetics across diverse ZDHHC family members and suggest that future generations of increasingly optimal ZDHHC mutant/probe pairs may be established by combining refined modeling approaches with wider-ranging mutant screens and additional bumped lipid designs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative ZDHHC chemical-genetic substrate profiling</head><p>The identification of diverse ZDHHC mutant/probe pairs offers the opportunity to undertake comparative chemical-genetic substrate profiling between ZDHHCs.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Chemical genetics opens a ZDHHC-specific window on the expansive S-acylation network, enhancing the detection of substrates and S-acylation sites with low abundance or stoichiometry while simultaneously linking them to a cognate ZDHHC by circumventing ZDHHC redundancy. HEK293T cells express all 23 human ZDHHCs to a measurable extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> , and against this background, Ifitm3 S-acylation is essentially unaffected by ZDHHC20 KO, consistent with previous studies suggesting that IFITM3 may be S-acylated by ZDHHCs 3, 7, 15 and 20 (ref. 21). Indeed, a combination of traditional ZDHHC20 substrate identification strategies (KO, overexpression or proximity labeling with N-or C-terminal TurboID fusions) identified few significant hits and failed to identify known substrates at endogenous abundance (Supplementary Data 8). In contrast, chemical-genetic analyses readily identified endogenous IFITM3 as a high-confidence ZDHHC20 substrate, alongside several other examples (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</p><p>Extending chemical-genetic systems across the S-acyltransferase family has the potential to generate comprehensive contextual ZDHHC-specific substrate maps analogous to kinase-specific phosphorylation datasets, enabling elucidation of substrates and sites https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-02030-0 common and unique between ZDHHCs in varied cell and tissue types. The present study illustrates the potential of this approach through the identification of diverse partially overlapping substrate sets that exhibit a narrower spectrum of functional annotation than the wider S-acylated proteome. Validation of new and established ZDHHC20 substrates alongside high-fidelity recapitulation of known S-acylation site stoichiometry demonstrates that these datasets encompass bona fide ZDHHC-specific substrates, alongside a rich set of putative substrates for future validation. Chemical genetics also offers a unique approach for resolving ZDHHC isoform-dependent S-acylation at the level of specific PTM sites, while limiting or eliminating probe distribution into non-ZDHHC-dependent pathways (for example, membrane lipid biosynthesis, O-and N-linked acylation), which is an unavoidable liability of generic lipid analogs such as YnPal <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . Lipidomic analyses suggest that bumped probes are not extensively processed into membrane lipid pools and do not alter endogenous lipid biosynthetic pathways.</p><p>We have demonstrated a systematic design and screening approach to establish effective ZDHHC chemical-genetic systems, including strategies for rescue mutations. In principle, we believe that most or all ZDHHCs should be amenable to chemical genetics through optimization beyond our preliminary screen through model refinement <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> , deeper mutational analysis, bumped lipid probe design and mutant/probe structure determination, for example, by cryogenic electron microscopy. Successful labeling of substrates by regulated low-level ZDHHC overexpression presents a promising direction for future optimization; however, initial experiments with gene-edited cell lines suggest that enrichment at endogenous ZDHHC expression may lie below the detection limit of first-generation designs. Next-generation designs may overcome this limitation while enabling new applications, for example, cell-type-specific analysis of ZDHHC activity in organoid or animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> , or exploration of ZDHHC coregulation with multiplexed bioorthogonal tags <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> .

Dysregulation of ZDHHC activity is associated with diverse pathologies including cancer, inflammation and neurodegeneration, and we envisage applications of chemical genetics for drug target validation and discovery in ZDHHC-associated disease models, and across diverse eukaryotes, for example, parasites, plants or fungi. Chemical proteomics also offers an ideal platform to analyze in-family selectivity of future small molecule ZDHHC inhibitors; conversely, it may prove possible to adapt bumped probes into chemical-genetic inhibitors, offering a general solution to the current lack of specific ZDHHC inhibitors for functional studies.</p></div>

Mouse-derived monoclonal antibodies for FLAG M2 (F1804), HA-epitope (HA-7, H3663) and α-tubulin (T5168) and rabbit-derived polyclonal antibodies for ZDHHC20 (Atlas Antibodies, HPA014702), BCAP31 (Atlas Antibodies, HPA003906) and V5-epitope (SAB1306079) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (GF28R) antibody was purchased from Generon, rabbit monoclonal anti-TOMM20 (ab186735) antibody was purchased from Abcam, rabbit polyclonal anti-TMX1 (HPA003085) antibody was purchased from Atlas Antibodies, rabbit polyclonal anti-NCAM1/CD56 (14255-1-AP) and anti-PI4K2A (15318-1-AP) antibodies were bought from ProteinTech and rabbit-derived polyclonal antibodies against vinculin (42H89L44) and calnexin (ab22595) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific and Abcam, respectively. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated, polyclonal goat-derived antibodies against mouse (Dako, P0447) and rabbit (Dako, P0448), or fluorophore-conjugated IRDye 680CW goat anti-mouse (Licor, 926-68072) and IRDye 680CW goat anti-rabbit (Licor, 926-32211). Western blot analysis was accomplished through SDS-PAGE of cell lysates or affinity-resin eluates in 1× Laemmli loading buffer (Bio-Rad, 1610747) containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol and transfer of protein onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or nitrocellulose using the Trans-Blot Turbo System (Bio-Rad). Secondary HRP-conjugates were visualized after addition of Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, 1705061) and chemiluminescent detection in an Amersham Imager 680 (GE Life Sciences) or fluorescence detection using a LICOR Odyssey CLx. Quantitation of western blot protein intensity was performed by densitometry using ImageJ 1.50c or Image Studio Lite (GE Life Sciences), and data were plotted using Prism 9.0. ZDHHC structural modeling. Human ZDHHC family protein sequences were aligned using the 'Create Alignment' module of CLC Sequence Viewer 7. Regions of sequence similarity that also overlap with ZDHHC20 transmembrane helices (TMs) 1-4 and the DHHC-containing cysteine-rich domain were identified and selected for homology modeling. To generate homology models for ZDHHCs 1-19 and 21-24, selected sequences were individually submitted to the Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre 2 ) using the 'Normal' modeling mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> . To identify putative bump-hole mutations, homology models were structurally aligned to the ZDHHC20-2BP crystal structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 6BML) using MacPyMOL: PyMOL V1.5.0.4. Residues located on TM3 and spatially overlapping with or proximal to ZDHHC20-Y181 were prioritized for bump-hole analysis; however, several ZDHHC models did not present residues meeting these criteria. In this case, strict rules were adopted including (1) selection of ZDHHC20-Y181 or (2) -F65 proximal residues located on TMs 2 and 3 overlapping with ZDHHC20 residues having B-factor https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-02030-0 values &lt;100 and (3) when rules 1 and 2 fail, residues on TM1 proximal to the ω-position of the 2BP fatty acid chain and with lowest ZDHHC20 B-factor value were selected for bump-hole screening. Residues presented by TM1 were given least priority as their side chains have access to the lipid-binding pocket and the bilayer. Potentially, mutations on this helix could generate a hole in the pocket, leading to structural instability or loss of lipid-probe binding affinity.</p></div>

Lentiviral plasmid pLVX-C-FLAG-D20, packaging</head><p>and viral envelope plasmids pCMV-Delta-8.2 (Addgene, 12263) and pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene, 8454) and HEK293-FT cells were used to prepare lentiviral particles according to the instructions in the Lenti-X Lentiviral Expression System Manual (Clontech). Doxycycline-inducible ZDHHC20 expressing HEK293T cells were prepared by transduction of 2.5 × 10 5 low-passage cells with lentivirus, followed by puromycin selection at 1.0 μg ml -1 for 1 week. After 1 week, cells were cultured in normal media containing 0.5 μg ml -1 puromycin and, after four or more passages, sent to the Flow Cytometry Science Technical Platform for single-cell sorting into 96-well plates. Briefly, single cells were sorted on the Beckman Coulter MoFlo XDP, using the 488 nm forward scatter (FSC) LASER signal to trigger events. Cells were identified and separated from debris using side scatter (SSC) height versus FSC height. Doublets were then removed using SSC height versus SSC width (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). Single cells were sorted into 96-well plates using the single-cell sort mask with a drop envelope of 0.5.</p><p>Clones were expanded into 12-well plates and induced with 2 μg ml -1 doxycycline for 2 d before anti-FLAG western blot screening.

For transfection conditions, see Cellular and biochemical analysis-Cellular ZDHHC-autoacylation and substrate transfer. After selection, single cells were sorted into 96-well plates, as described above, expanded into 12-well plates and then screened by immunoblot with antibodies against GFP, V5 and FLAG epitopes.</p><p>Subcloning BCAP31 into mammalian expression vector. After extracting total RNA from HEK293T cells using the GenElute Total RNA Purification Kit (Merck, RNB100), 500 ng of total RNA was used to amplify BCAP31 (isoform 1, P51572) cDNA using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 12574018) and the following primer set: forward primer ATG AGT CTG CAG TGG ACT GCA GTT G and reverse primer TTA CTC TTC CTT CTT GTC CAT G. BCAP31 cDNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted and shuttled into a TOPO-TA vector. After blue-white screening, white colonies were selected, amplified in the presence of ampicillin and then collected to prepare DNA minipreps. Miniprepped DNA was digested with KpnI and SmaI and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of BCAP31. All inserts were oriented in the reverse sense, and Sanger sequencing verified the sequence of human BCAP31, isoform 1. To generate an HA-tagged BCAP31 construct in a mammalian expression vector, BCAP31 PCR fragment was subcloned into SalI-and BalI-linearized pcDNA3.1(+)-HA-Ifitm3 vector using the NEBuilder HiFi Assembly kit.

Click reactions were performed with 100 μM of the described azide, 1 mM CuSO 4 , 1 mM TCEP and 100 μM TBTA for 1 h at room temperature and were quenched with 5 mM EDTA or the reaction solution removed when performed on-bead.</p><p>Cellular ZDHHC-autoacylation and substrate transfer. Pulldown. FLAG-tagged ZDHHC was singly or cotransfected with affinity-tagged substrate (FLAG or HA epitopes) in HEK293T cells. For a single, reverse-transfection mixture, 1-2 μg of ZDHHC plasmid, alone (autoacylation) or in combination with 0.5 μg substrate (transfer) plasmid, was mixed with three volumes of FuGene HD (3:1 FuGene (μl)/ plasmid (μg); Promega, E2311) in 100 μl of Opti-MEM. After 15 min, the transfection mixtures were added to 1-2 × 10 6 cells in 900 μl of culture media and cells incubated at 37 °C o/n. Cells were treated with DMSO or probe in 10% FBS (YnPal) or 0.5% FBS (bumped probes) at the indicated concentrations for 4 h at 37 °C, after which they were dislodged by manual pipetting, pelleted at 200g for 5 min and the media was discarded. Cells were washed 2× ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and pelleted each time to remove the supernatant. Cells were lysed with 0.5 ml DDM lysis buffer-50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% DDM, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10 μM palmostatin B, 1× protease inhibitor tablet, 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0.05 U μl -1 benzonase. After shaking https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-02030-0 for 10 min at room temperature, lysates were clarified at 17,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The clarified lysates were treated with the appropriate affinity resins, anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, M8823) and/or Pierce anti-HA (Life Technologies, 88836) magnetic beads, or diluted with 4× Laemmli buffer for analysis. FLAG-and/or HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at room temperature or o/n at 4 °C and then washed with wash buffer (1% NP-40 in PBS). A click reaction was performed with TAMRA-azide in wash buffer for 1 h, then beads were washed with wash buffer, treated with 1× Laemmli loading buffer and then eluates subjected to SDS-PAGE. For samples used to demonstrate thioester-dependent labeling, before 1× Laemmli addition, beads were incubated with 0.8 M neutralized NH 2 OH in PBS (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature and then diluted with 4× Laemmli buffer. After protein separation, TAMRA-labeled proteins were visualized using a Typhoon FLA 9500 instrument. The Typhoon resolution was set to 25 μm and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) value varied from 500 to 1,000 depending on signal intensity. Finally, protein was transferred to PVDF/nitrocellulose and analyzed via western analysis to reveal ZDHHC and substrate input. For loading and transfer, the fluorescent signals were normalized against input as determined by western blot analysis.</p><p>Cell lysate. These follow the same protocol as the pull-down assay with the following modifications. Cells were lysed in a PBS RIPA buffer supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor and clarified at 17,000g and 4 °C. Lysates were clicked with TAMRA-azide for 1 h and then precipitated using chloroform/methanol. Protein pellets were washed in MeOH and then dissolved in 1× Laemmli buffer diluted in 1% NP-40 in PBS by shaking for 1 h at room temperature. For samples used to demonstrate thioester-dependent labeling, the dissolution solution was supplemented with 0.8 M neutralized NH 2 OH and lysates were then analyzed by in-gel fluorescence and western blot. TREX HEK293 assays. TREX HEK293T cells were seeded and left overnight in an incubator at 37 °C in standard media supplemented with 1 μg ml -1 blasticidin and 50 μg ml -1 hygromycin B. On the day before the treatment of cells with the appropriate probes, media was supplemented with 1 μg ml -1 of doxycycline or water alongside any transfection reagents that were applied as described above. All assays then followed the same methods as described above. ZDHHC20 enzyme kinetic mutant and probe analysis. Protein purification. For each FLAG-ZDHHC20 construct, two dishes of HEK293T cells were prepared and transfected with calcium phosphate transfection mix. To a 10 cm tissue culture dish, 6 × 10 6 HEK293T cells in 8 ml DMEM culture media were added. Cells were allowed to settle o/n in a 37 °C incubator. To prepare the calcium phosphate transfection mix, 10 μg of C-FLAG-D20 construct and water were added to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube to a volume of 436 μl. To this was added 64 μl of 2 M CaCl 2 to give a final volume of 500 μl. This solution was slowly added dropwise and with continuous bubbling to 500 μl 2× Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS;273.8 mM NaCl, 9.4 mM KCl, 1.5 mM Na 2 HPO 4 -7H 2 O, 15 mM glucose, 42 mM HEPES (free acid) pH 7.05 in Milli-Q H 2 O, filter sterilized) in a sterile 30 ml polystyrene tube. This solution was incubated at room temperature for 5 min before use. To a 10 cm plate of HEK293T cells, 1 ml of the DNA mixture was added. The mix was added dropwise and evenly across the media surface to ensure maximal cell coverage with precipitated DNA. The tissue culture dish was returned to the 37 °C incubator and left to incubate for 72 h before collecting cells for protein purification.</p><p>After 72 h, cells were dislodged manually using an automatic pipette, collected in a 50 ml falcon tube and pelleted at 200g for 5 min. The media was decanted, and cells were washed 3× with cold PBS. The cell pellet was dislodged and lysed with 5 ml 2% DDM buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2% DDM, 0.5 mM TCEP, 10 μM palmostatin B and 1× protease inhibitor tablet), vortexed thoroughly and allowed to incubate at 4 °C with constant rotation. After 4 h, lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000g and 4 °C. In total, 1 ml anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel suspension was equilibrated in 5 ml 1% DDM buffer before use. The clarified lysate was diluted with 1 volume (~5 ml) of the described buffer containing no DDM, to give a final concentration of 1% DDM, before being added to cold resin and allowed to mix o/n at 4 °C. After incubation, the lysate-resin mix was added to an Econo-Pac gravity-flow chromatography column (Bio-Rad, 7321010). The lysate container was rinsed thoroughly with 1% DDM buffer to transfer all residual resin to the column. The resin was washed sequentially with ice-cold buffer W1 (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% DDM, 2 mM TCEP and 1× protease inhibitors), W2 (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mM NaCl, 0.2% DDM, 2 mM TCEP and 1× protease inhibitors) and W3 (W2 with 25 mM NaCl). After washing, FLAG-ZDHHC20 was eluted with 5 × 0.5 ml portions of buffer W3 containing 0.25 mg ml -1 3× FLAG-peptide (MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK, Crick Peptide Chemistry STP stock peptide). FLAG-ZDHHC20 containing fractions were pooled, and buffer was exchanged with W3 simultaneously with concentration using an Amicon Ultra 15 ml Spin-Column with 50 kDa cut-off.</p><p>Enzyme-coupled ZDHHC20-autoacylation assay. Autoacylation reactions were carried out as previously described with a few exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Reactions were prepared in a Corning 96-well black half-area plate (3686). In one well was prepared a prestart mix with the indicated concentration of fatty acid-or probe-CoA, 2 mM α-ketoglutaric acid, 0.25 mM NAD (β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized) and 0.2 mM thiamine pyrophosphate in 25 μl reaction buffer (25 mM MES (pH 6.8), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM DDM and 1× protease inhibitors). The reaction was started by addition of 25 μl ZDHHC master mix containing 20 nM ZDHHC20 and 2 μl of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH; Sigma-Aldrich, K1502). In the first reaction step, ZDHHC20 autoacylation leads to the production of free CoA-SH, which is then converted to NADH in the next step by KDH. NADH production was monitored using the fluorescence module (Ex. 360 nm/ Em. 465 nm) of the Tecan Spark Multimode Microplate Reader. Note that 18-Bz-CoA exhibited weak, but measurable, activity in KDH reactions without ZDHHC20 enzyme. Therefore, all rates from reactions with ZDHHC20 and 18-Bz-CoA were adjusted by subtraction of the ZDHHC20-independent rates from the corresponding total rates of reactions with ZDHHC20 (Extended Data Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3g</ref>).</p></div>

HEK293T cells were seeded in six-well plates, grown to 70% confluency and treated with bumped fatty acid probes (15 μM) for 4 h. Cells were dislodged into their growth media by pipetting and pelleted by centrifugation (500g, 5 min). The cell pellet was washed 2× with ice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate. An aliquot (10%) was kept aside for protein concentration determination, and the remaining sample was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further processing. For protein concentration determination, cells were lysed in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78501), and protein content was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23227) as per the manufacturer's instructions. An aliquot equivalent to 100 μg protein per sample was used for lipid extraction. Lipids were extracted by the methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) method with minor modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> . Extractions were performed in glass vials fitted with Teflon-lined caps using MS-grade solvents and water. Glass pipettes were used to handle any MTBE-containing solutions or lipid extracts. Methanol (1.5 ml) was added, and the protein sample was vortexed. MTBE (5 ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature on a shaker. Phase separation was induced by the addition of water (1.25 ml) followed by incubation for 10 min at room temperature. The sample was centrifuged (1,000g, 10 min), and the upper organic phase was collected. The lower aqueous phase was re-extracted by addition of 1.67 ml of solvent mixture comprising MTBE/methanol (10:3, vol/vol) and 0.32 ml water. The samples were vortexed, incubated for 10 min and centrifuged (1,000g, 10 min). The upper phase was recovered, and the combined organic phases were evaporated at 37 °C under a stream of nitrogen and stored at -20 °C. Before analysis, lipid extracts were reconstituted in 100 μl loading buffer (isopropanol/water/acetonitrile, 2:1:1, vol/vol/vol). Blank control extraction was performed on a 200 μl aliquot of 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution. Quality control (QC) samples were prepared by pooling a small aliquot of all experimental samples after resuspension in the loading buffer.</p></div>

UHPLC-MS analysis was performed on a 1290 Infinity II UHPLC system coupled to a 6550 iFunnel quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). The reversed-phase chromatography protocol was optimized with minor modifications from Cajka and Fiehn <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> . Extracted lipids were separated on an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column (130 Å, 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) fitted with an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 VanGuard precolumn (130 Å, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 5 mm; both waters). The column was maintained at 65 °C at a flow rate of 0.6 ml min -1 . The mobile phases used were 60:40 (vol/vol) acetonitrile/ H 2 O (solvent A) and 10:90 (vol/vol) acetonitrile/isopropanol (solvent B). Solvents A and B were supplemented with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid for ESI-positive mode and with 10 mM ammonium acetate for ESI-negative-mode analysis. UHPLC gradient elution was carried out as follows: 15-30% solvent B for 0-2 min; 30-48% solvent B for 2-2.5 min; 48-82% solvent B for 2.5-11 min; 82-99% solvent B for https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-02030-0 11-11.5 min; 99% solvent B for 11.5-14.50 min. The gradient was returned to initial conditions over 0.5 min, and the column was equilibrated for 3 min before subsequent runs. Between injections a 100% isopropanol needle wash was performed. For negative mode, 5 μl (MS mode) or 10 μl (MS/MS mode) of the sample was injected, and for positive mode, 4 μl (MS mode) or 8 μl (MS/MS mode) of the sample was injected. Samples were injected in randomized order, with QC sample injections added to the start, middle and end of each sample sequence to ensure consistency and reproducibility of all acquisition parameters. Samples were loaded in random order by blinded selection from pooled anonymously labeled samples.</p><p>Electrospray parameters were set as follows: gas and sheath gas temperature, 200 °C; drying gas flow, 14 l min -1 ; sheath gas flow, 11 l min -1 ; sheath gas temperature, 350 °C; nebulizer pressure, 35 psig; capillary voltage, 3,000 V; nozzle voltage, 1,000 V. MS-TOF fragmentor and Oct 1 RF Vpp radio voltage were set to 350 and 750 V, respectively. The QTOF was calibrated and operated in the extended dynamic range mode (∼2 GHz) in the mass range of 50-1,700 m/z. Spectra were acquired in centroid mode with an acquisition rate of 2 spectra per second for MS mode acquisition. Data were acquired in MS mode for quantitative analysis of the natural lipidome and in MS/MS mode to obtain data for lipid structure assignment.</p><p>MS/MS data were acquired in auto-MS/MS mode (data-dependent). Spectra were acquired in centroid mode with an acquisition rate of 1 and 5 spectra per second for MS and MS/MS acquisition, respectively. Collision energy was adjusted to -35 eV and 30 eV for negative and positive modes, respectively. Mass range for precursor selection was 300-1,650 m/z (negative) and 250-1,680 m/z (positive). Fragmentation was triggered if the precursor reached 5,000 (negative) or 2,000 (positive) counts, and the maximum precursors per cycle was set to 5. MS/MS isolation width for precursors was selected as narrow (1.3 m/z). Active exclusion was enabled, set to exclude after 3 spectra and release after 0.1 min. To improve precursor selection, background ions were added to an exclusion list. For structure determination of probe-derived lipids, a list of preferred precursor ions was generated for each probe to improve MS/MS coverage of features originating from probe metabolism. MS/MS analysis of DMSO control samples was used to confirm the assignment of natural lipids.</p><p>Quantitative analysis of natural lipidome. Lipid annotations and quantifications were performed following the guidelines of the Lipidomics Standard Initiative (https://lipidomics-standards-initiative. org/). Feature extraction was carried out in Mass Hunter Profinder (v. 10.0, Agilent Technologies) using the 'Batch Targeted Feature Extraction' option. Features were matched to an in-house library containing mass and retention time information of lipid species including glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, fatty acids and glycolipids. All lipids in the database were previously assigned from MS/MS data using MS-DIAL <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> followed by manual curation. H + , Na + and NH 4 + adducts were selected for positive mode, and H -, C 2 H 3 O 2 -and CHO 2 -adducts were selected for negative-mode data. Both mass and retention time were required for feature matching. Match tolerance was set to 5 ppm for mass and 0.15 min for retention time. The EIC extraction range was limited to ± 0.3 min of the expected retention time. An overall score of &gt;70 was required for feature matching, with the contribution to overall score set as follows: mass score 100, isotope abundance score 60, isotope spacing score 50 and retention time score 100. Features over 20% of the saturation limit were excluded from the dataset. Matched features were manually inspected and re-integrated where required and checked for the correct adduct pattern for the relevant lipid class. Data were exported as .csv files containing the identity, peak area and the retention time of each lipid species. Further data analysis and data representation were performed in Excel and GraphPad Prism. The relative abundance of each lipid species within a class was calculated as a percentage of the summed peak areas of all species identified within the class. Triglyceride (TG) species were quantified from data acquired in positive mode, while all other species were quantified from data acquired in negative mode (n = 5 for each experimental condition).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assignment of probe-derived lipids.</head><p>Feature extraction of data acquired in MS mode was carried out in Mass Hunter Profinder (v. 10.0, Agilent Technologies) using the 'Batch Recursive Feature Extraction (small molecule/peptide)' option. Samples were grouped according to experimental conditions. All parameters except those detailed below were used as preset by the program. Peak heights were set to a minimum of 3,000 counts. H + , Na + and NH 4 + adducts were selected for positive mode, and H -, C 2 H 3 O 2 -and CHO 2 -adducts were selected for negative mode. For compound binning and alignment, retention time tolerance was set to (±0% + 0.15 min) and mass tolerance to (±5 ppm + 2 mDa). A minimum free energy score of at least 70 was required in at least 4 of 6 samples per group. For match tolerance, the mass was set to ±10 ppm and retention time to ±0.15 min. The EIC extraction range was limited to ±0.15 min of the expected retention time. An overall score of &gt;75 was required for feature matching, with the contribution to the overall score set as follows: mass score 100, isotope abundance score 60, isotope spacing score 50 and retention time score 100. Features over 20% of the saturation limit were excluded from the dataset. Postprocessing filters were set to require a score (Tgt) of at least 50 in 4 of 6 samples per experimental group.</p><p>Manual filtering was performed to remove features present in the blank extraction samples. To create a list of features originating from probe metabolism, only features unique to each probe condition were selected. All features present in DMSO control samples were discarded. Features were manually inspected and re-integrated where required. The feature lists were used to create inclusion lists for MS/MS analysis and peak lists for lipid annotations as described below.</p><p>LipidMatch (v. 3.5) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> was used for assignment of probe-derived lipids. Lipid libraries containing theoretical fragments of probe-derived lipid species of different classes (PC, PE, PC-O, PE-O, PC-P, PE-P, Cer-NS, Cer-NDS, diglyceride (DG) and TG) were constructed and added to the existing library folder. Agilent .d files were converted to .ms2 format using MSConvertGUI (ProteoWizard) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . The search was performed using the feature tables created above. Search parameters were set as follows: retention time window, ±0.15 min; ppm window for matching experimental and in silico fragments, ±5 ppm; mass accuracy window for matching experimental and in silico precursors, ±0.005 Da; MS/ MS isolation window, 1 Da; minimum signal intensity for MS/MS ion, 1; minimum number of scans for confirmation, 1. All lipid assignments were manually curated by inspecting MS/MS spectra and ensuring correct adduct formation for the relevant lipid class. Additionally, a small number of lipids were assigned manually from MS/MS spectra. The retention time of all probe-derived lipid species matched the expected retention time window for the relevant lipid class. Note that in contrast to natural DG and TG species, which preferentially form NH 4 + and Na + adducts, probed-derived DG and TG species preferentially formed the (M + H) + ion, presumably through protonation at the amide moiety.</p></div>

Statistical analysis and P values were determined using an FDR-adjusted two-tailed Fisher's exact test. Results were filtered for those with a -log 10 (P value) &gt; 9. The human S-acylome contains the combined unique hits between the following filtered SwissPalm lists: the first list was collated by setting the 'nber_palmitoyl_proteome_hits' and 'nber_technique_categories' ≥2 and the second list was generated by setting the 'nber_palmitoyl_proteome_hits' ≤1 and 'nber_targeted_ study_hits' ≥1. After conversion of Uniprot AC IDs to gene names, the combined list of unique genes totaled 2,429. Results were filtered for those with a -log 10 (P value) &gt; 1.5.</p></div>

In short, 4 × 10 5 HEK293T cells were seeded per well in a six-well plate a day before transfection. To transfect cells with an assembled ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, the following reagents were mixed: 6.25 μg of https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-02030-0 TrueCut Cas9 v2 protein (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A36496), 1.2 μg of sgRNA (5′-CACGAAAAGGCAAUAUAAUA-3′), 50 pmol of ssDNA (5′-AAATTCTTCCTGCTGTTTTTATTGTATTCCCTA[CTAGGTTGT] CTTTTCGTGGCTGCAACAGTTTTAGAGTACTT-3′, knock-in sequence in brackets), 12.5 μl of Lipofectamine Cas9 Plus Reagent and 7.5 μl of Lipofectamine CRISPRMAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CMAX00001) in 250 μl of Opti-MEM. The RNP mix was added to cells with 2.5 ml of fresh media and placed back in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 . Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded at 0.8 cells per well density on a 96-well plate to increase the probability of isolating single-cell clones. Cells were then placed back in the incubator, and 2 million cells from the remaining trypsinized cells were pelleted and flash frozen to be used as a control for downstream analyses. Three weeks after seeding the cells, wells that showed only one colony were further expanded in 24-well plates. When monoclonal populations reached 90% confluency, cells were trypsinized and half of them were frozen for storage. From the remaining cells, along with the transfected parental polyclonal cell population, genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (NEB, T3010S) following the manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p>To assess if the Y181G sequence had successfully replaced the endogenous sequence in at least one allele, gDNA from each monoclonal cell line was probed by PCR with GoTaq G2 (Promega, M7841) using manufacturer recommendations and with the following program: 95 °C for 2 min for initial denaturation, 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min and final step of extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Forward primer 5′-TGTATTCCCTA [CTAGGTTGT]-3′ (knock-in sequence in brackets) and reverse primer 5′-CCCTATCTGTCCTCTGAT-3′ were used to produce an amplicon of 213 bp, which was resolved in a 2% agarose gel.</p><p>After selecting positive clones, a second PCR was carried out in these to confirm by Sanger sequencing that the Y181G mutation sequence had been successfully integrated and that the ORF of ZDHHC20 exon 7 was intact with no indels present. The PCR amplicon was produced using Q5 master mix (NEB, M0492S) and the following program: 98 °C for 30 s for initial denaturation, 33 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 10 s, annealing at 68 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 20 s and a final step of extension at 72 °C for 20 s. The primers used (forward 5′-GGCAGCCTCCATCCTACTTT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCCCTATCTGTCCTCTGATGG-3′) produced an amplicon of 348 bp, which was resolved in a 1.5% agarose gel, recovered using Monarch DNA gel extraction kit (NEB, T1020) following manufacturer's recommendations and submitted to Genewiz for Sanger sequencing.</p></div>

WT and mutant constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells and treated with 15 μM probe for 4 h. After cell lysis, constructs were immunoprecipitated on anti-FLAG resin, clicked with TAMRA-azide and separated by SDS-PAGE. Loading and input were visualized by in-gel fluorescence and anti-FLAG immunoblot, respectively. The average (n = 3 independent biological replicates) loading (b, d, f, and h) was reported as a percent of the maximal fluorescent: input ratios ± S.D. The two tailed unpaired t-test of Prism 9.0 was used to determine p-values and noted above relevant comparisons.
