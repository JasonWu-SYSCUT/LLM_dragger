<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>RhoU is an atypical member of the Rho family of small G-proteins, which has N-and C-terminal extensions compared to the classic Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, and associates with membranes through C-terminal palmitoylation rather than prenylation. RhoU mRNA expression is upregulated in prostate cancer and is considered a marker for disease progression. Here, we show that RhoU overexpression in prostate cancer cells increases cell migration and invasion. To identify RhoU targets that contribute to its function, we found that RhoU homodimerizes in cells. We map the region involved in this interaction to the C-terminal extension and show that C-terminal palmitoylation is required for self-association. Expression of the isolated C-terminal extension reduces RhoU-induced activation of p21-activated kinases (PAKs), which are known downstream targets for RhoU, and induces cell morphological changes consistent with inhibiting RhoU function. Our results show for the first time that the activity of a Rho family member is stimulated by self-association, and this is important for its activity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Rho family of small guanosine triphosphates (GTPases) form a subfamily of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases. Rho GTPases regulate multiple cellular processes through their effects on cytoskeletal and cell adhesion dynamics, including cell migration, cytokinesis, cell cycle progression, vesicle trafficking and transcriptional changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hodge and Ridley, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ridley, 2015)</ref>. Most Rho GTPases cycle between an active GTP-bound conformation and an inactive GDP-bound conformation. When bound to GTP, they interact with effector proteins to induce cellular responses. The intrinsic ability of Rho GTPases to exchange GDP for GTP is catalysed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), leading to their activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Rossman et al., 2005)</ref>. Conversely, GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate GTP hydrolysis, inactivating them <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hodge and Ridley, 2016)</ref>. Rho GTPases are also regulated by multiple different types of posttranslational modifications, including prenyl and palmitoyl lipidation, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hodge and Ridley, 2016)</ref>. Some Rho GTPases are also regulated by guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which interact with their C-terminal prenyl groups, extract them from membranes and sequester them in the cytosol <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Garcia-Mata et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>RhoU is an atypical Rho GTPase that is part of the RhoU and RhoV subfamily of Rho GTPases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hodge and Ridley, 2017)</ref>. It has unique N-and C-terminal extensions not found in other Rho GTPases, and the N-terminal extension region binds to SH3 domains from Grb2, Nck and phospholipase Cγ <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Shutes et al., 2004)</ref>. Grb2 binding increases its activity in cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Shutes et al., 2004)</ref>. The C-terminal extension region is modified by Srcmediated tyrosine phosphorylation, which decreases its plasma membrane association and activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alan et al., 2010)</ref>. RhoU is C-terminally palmitoylated and not prenylated, and hence will not bind to RhoGDIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berzat et al., 2005)</ref>. In addition, RhoU has a 10-fold higher intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange rate in vitro than Cdc42, whereas the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of RhoU and Cdc42 is similar <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Shutes et al., 2004)</ref>. Like Cdc42, it interacts with p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and PAR6, but does not bind to the Cdc42 target N-WASP <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brady et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tao et al., 2001)</ref>. Although no GEFs or GAPs for RhoU have so far been identified, it is probably regulated by GAPs because a constitutively active mutant, RhoU-Q107L, is more active than wild-type RhoU in binding and activating PAK1 and stimulating cellular responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berzat et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Saras et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Shutes et al., 2004)</ref>. RhoU is also regulated at the transcriptional level, it was first identified as a Wnt-inducible gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Tao et al., 2001)</ref>, and its expression is induced by Notch1 and STAT3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bhavsar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Schiavone et al., 2009)</ref>. Interestingly, PAK4 protects RhoU from ubiquitin-mediated degradation through a mechanism not requiring PAK4 kinase activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dart et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>RhoU expression is upregulated in prostate cancer and has been suggested to be a prognostic indicator for prostate cancer progression, along with other genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alinezhad et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Corradi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Piano et al., 2020)</ref>. Knockdown of RhoU expression by RNAi in prostate cancer cell lines reduces migration and invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alinezhad et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Tajadura-Ortega et al., 2018)</ref>. RhoU is also implicated in cell adhesion. For example, RhoU localizes to focal adhesions in HeLa cells and fibroblasts and stimulates loss of focal adhesions in both cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chuang et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ory et al., 2007)</ref>. Consistent with these results, RhoU depletion in breast and prostate cancer cell lines increases focal adhesion size <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dart et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">De Piano et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we investigate the hypothesis that RhoU is regulated by novel mechanisms given that it is an atypical GTPase. We find that RhoU homodimerizes in prostate cancer cells and that this is mediated by its C-terminal extension. This interaction is important for activation of PAKs, which are kinases activated by RhoU as well as other Rho family GTPases. Our results show that RhoU activity is stimulated by self-association.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RhoU overexpression promotes PC3 prostate cancer cell migration and invasion</head><p>RhoU overexpression has been reported to promote the formation of filopodia and decrease focal adhesions in fibroblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ory et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Saras et al., 2004)</ref>, but the effect of RhoU overexpression in prostate cancer cells has not been tested. Overexpression of Myc-RhoU using a doxycycline-inducible expression construct (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) caused PC3 prostate cancer cells to adopt an elongated phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>, reduced circularity in graph) and resulted in an increased speed of 2D cell migration (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Myc-RhoU overexpression also increased the invasion of PC3 cells through Matrigel, an effect which was recapitulated in a second prostate cancer cell line, DU145 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). Given that RhoU depletion increases the size of paxillin-positive adhesions in PC3 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(De Piano et al., 2020)</ref>, we reason that RhoU overexpression promotes PC3 cell migration and invasion through increased focal adhesion turnover.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RhoU forms homomeric complexes at membranes</head><p>In experiments aimed at identifying novel RhoU targets, we discovered that RhoU associated with itself by performing co-immunoprecipitation with differently tagged RhoU proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). No self-association was detected for another Rho family member, RhoB, which was chosen as a control because, like RhoU, it is known to localize to endosomes and the plasma membrane and to be palmitoylated as well as isoprenylated <ref type="bibr">(Adamson et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Phuyal and Farhan, 2019)</ref>. RhoU oligomerization was further demonstrated using a cross-linking approach in Myc-RhoUexpressing COS7 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) is a membrane-permeable cross-linker that contains two aminereactive N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups either side of an eightcarbon spacer arm. On the addition of increasing concentrations of DSS, a dose-dependent increase in a higher molecular mass crosslinked Myc-RhoU species was observed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). This crosslinked Myc-RhoU species migrated at ∼56 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels, which is equivalent to two 28-kDa RhoU monomers. This suggested RhoU can dimerize, which was unexpected as classical Rho GTPases are assumed to be monomeric based on crystal structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ihara et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Mott and Owen, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Worthylake et al., 2000)</ref>. By contrast, no dimers of Myc-RhoB were detected following DSS treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>).</p><p>To investigate whether RhoU self-associates in living cells, PC3 cells were co-transfected with GFP-RhoU and mCherry-RhoU or GFP-RhoB and mCherry-RhoB as controls. Cells were analysed by fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to determine whether the differently fluorescent-protein-tagged proteins were close enough for FRET to occur (&lt;10 nm; <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Day and Davidson, 2012)</ref>. GFP-RhoU and mCherry-RhoU demonstrated FRET, but not GFP-RhoB and mCherry-RhoB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). These results indicate that self-association is specific to RhoU and not a consequence of high Rho GTPase expression. We have previously shown that RhoU expression is upregulated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bhavsar et al., 2013)</ref>. Using FLIM, we found that RhoU self-association could also be detected in Jurkat cells, a T-ALL cell line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). In PC3 cells, RhoU interacted with itself primarily at the plasma membrane, whereas in Jurkat cells, RhoU oligomers localized to intracellular sites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Previous work has demonstrated that the palmitate analog 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) causes mislocalization and cytosolic accumulation of RhoU <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berzat et al., 2005)</ref>. Addition of 2-BP to cells resulted in a significant decrease in the coimmunoprecipitation of differently tagged RhoU proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>). This indicates that the dimerization of RhoU is dependent on its ability to target to membranes. Interestingly, 2-BP treatment increased levels of GFP-and Myc-tagged RhoU, suggesting that RhoU might be stabilized by mislocalization to the cytoplasm (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</p><p>To test whether RhoU dimerization requires RhoU to be in its active GTP-bound form, we used a RhoU-Q107L mutant, analogous to the activating Q61L mutation in Ras, which locks Ras in the active GTP-bound conformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ory et al., 2007)</ref>. The Q107L mutation had no effect on the ability of RhoU to dimerize with wild-type RhoU (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>), indicating that the GTP-binding domain does not play a crucial role in RhoU self-association.</p><p>RhoU has unique N-terminal and C-terminal extensions, which are not related to similar extensions in other members of the Rho GTPase family such as RhoV and Rnd proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Hodge and Ridley, 2017)</ref>. We considered that the N-and C-terminal regions were likely mediators of dimerization. The C-terminal four amino acids of RhoU are CCFV; S-palmitoylation of RhoU at the second C-terminal C256 has been shown to be crucial for its association with biological membranes, although both C255 and C256 contribute to RhoU subcellular localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Berzat et al., 2005)</ref>. We found that RhoU(C255S, C256S) localized to the cytoplasm (data not shown) and failed to co-immunoprecipitate with wild-type RhoU (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). We reasoned that deletion of the RhoU C-terminal extension would result in a similar mislocalization of RhoU and therefore generated two constructs expressing different lengths of the C-terminal extension in isolation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Both RhoU(204-258) and RhoU(231-258) co-immunoprecipitated with full-length RhoU to the same extent as the wild-type protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), indicating that RhoU dimerization is mediated by residues between amino acids 231 and 258. We found that deletion of the N-terminal extension had no effect on RhoU dimerization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>).</p><p>Further co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that RhoU(231-358) was able to self-associate, although this interaction was significantly weaker than its interaction with full-length RhoU (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). We therefore suggest that RhoU dimerization is mediated by self-association of the RhoU C-terminal extension but requires a region within RhoU residues 47-204 for stabilization, potentially because it enables folding of the central Rho domain.</p><p>To enable investigation into the functional significance of RhoU dimerization, we explored whether RhoU(231-258) could be utilized as a competitive inhibitor. Overexpression of RhoU(231-258) mut , which harbors the mutations C255S and C256S and cannot interact with full-length RhoU, had no effect on the co-immunoprecipitation of HA-RhoU with Myc-RhoU. In contrast, overexpression of wild-type RhoU(231-258) significantly impaired the association of the differently tagged full-length RhoU constructs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). that homo-oligomerization of endogenous RhoU is required for cells to adopt an elongated, migratory phenotype. RhoU has been reported to interact with several proteins, of which the PAKs are the most well characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Shutes et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tao et al., 2001)</ref>. PAKs are serine/threonine kinases that are known to be involved in a variety of cellular responses, including cell morphology and  migration. RhoU has been reported to bind to and activate the type I PAK, PAK1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Saras et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tao et al., 2001)</ref>, and we found that autophosphorylation of all three type 1 PAKs, PAK1-PAK3, is stimulated by RhoU overexpression in PC3 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). Co-expression with RhoU(231-258) significantly reduced RhoUstimulated PAK2 autophosphorylation on Thr402 and Ser141 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>), suggesting that oligomerization of full-length RhoU molecules facilitates the activation of PAK2 by RhoU. The interaction of PAK2 with full-length RhoU was slightly increased in cells co-expressing RhoU(231-258), indicating that RhoU selfassociation is not a pre-requisite for binding to PAK2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Concluding remarks</head><p>Here, we report for the first time that the atypical Rho GTPase RhoU homodimerizes at the plasma membrane, and that this selfassociation is required for RhoU-mediated cell elongation and downstream signaling to its target PAK2. The classical Rho GTPase Rac1 and Ras proteins can form multimeric nanoclusters in the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Maxwell et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Simanshu et al., 2023)</ref>, and K-Ras has been reported to homodimerize <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Muratcioglu et al., 2015)</ref>. Our data indicate that RhoU homodimerizes via a distinct mechanism. For example, Rac1 nanoclustering has been shown to be regulated by a key arginine residue within the C-terminal polybasic region, yet mutagenesis of individual charged residues in the conserved RhoU polybasic region had no effect on RhoU selfassociation (data not shown). Furthermore, the segregation of Rac1 into nanoclusters is influenced by guanine nucleotide-binding status, yet we show that RhoU self-association is mediated by the C-terminal 27 amino acids. Our results therefore demonstrate for the first time that the activity of a Rho family member is stimulated by homodimerization.</p></div>

After 16 h, cells were imaged every 6 min for 24 h on a Leica DMi8 microscope using a 20× objective at 37°C, 5% CO 2 . Three independent experiments were performed in technical triplicate, with six fields of view (FOVs; 633 μm×633 μm, 1024×1024 pixels) imaged per well. Migration tracks were generated using the MOSES framework, as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Zhou et al., 2019b)</ref>. Briefly, 5000 superpixel tracks were extracted, tracking forwards from the start of the movie to the last frame. Individual cells in the first frame were segmented by thresholding the non-local means denoised and background subtracted image (background estimated by the white tophat transform) with morphological postprocessing. The migration track of each unique cell is then given by the most migrating superpixel track covered by its area as previously described <ref type="bibr">(Zhou et al., 2019a)</ref>.

Filters were washed with distilled water and removed from the Transwell insert using a scalpel before mounting onto glass slides using mounting medium (Dako, S3023). A Leica S9i light microscope was used to image eight FOVs per filter at 50× magnification. Invading cells were quantified by using FIJI to calculate the area covered by cells in each FOV.

Excitation was provided by a white light laser with a repetition rate of 20 MHz and an acousto-optical beam splitter (AOBS) selected an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. Images were acquired using a 63×1.4 NA oil immersion objective. Fluorescence was detected using a hybrid detector operating in photon counting mode over an emission range of 498-535 nm. A notch filter centered on 488 nm minimized any laser scatter into the detector. Time resolved data were acquired through use of a PicoHarp 300 TCSPC module (PicoQuant) controlled through SymPhoTime64 software (PicoQuant). FLIM Images were acquired with 256×256 pixels and 4096 time bins. The total integration time per image was ∼200 s. Fitting of FLIM images was performed with the FLIMfit software tool (version 5.0.3) developed at Imperial College London <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Warren et al., 2013)</ref>. Fitting of the fluorescence images was performed using global analysis across all repeat cells per condition.
