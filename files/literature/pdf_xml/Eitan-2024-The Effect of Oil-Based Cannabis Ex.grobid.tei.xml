<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The prevalence of obesity and obesity-related pathologies is lower in frequent cannabis users compared to non-users. It is well established that the endocannabinoid system has an important role in the development of obesity. We recently demonstrated that prolonged oral consumption of purified ∆-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but not of cannabidiol (CBD), ameliorates diet-induced obesity and improves obesity-related metabolic complications in a high-fat diet mouse model. However, the effect of commercially available medical cannabis oils that contain numerous additional active molecules has not been examined. We tested herein the effects of THC-and CBD-enriched medical cannabis oils on obesity parameters and the gut microbiota composition of C57BL/6 male mice fed with either a high-fat or standard diet. We also assessed the levels of prominent endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid-like lipid mediators in the liver. THC-enriched extract prevented weight gain by a high-fat diet and attenuated diet-induced liver steatosis concomitantly with reduced levels of the lipid mediators palmitoyl ethanolamide (PEA) and docosahexaenoyl ethanolamide (DHEA) in the liver. In contrast, CBD-enriched extract had no effect on weight gain, but, on the contrary, it even exacerbated liver steatosis. An analysis of the gut microbiota revealed that mainly time but not treatment exerted a strong effect on gut microbiota alterations. From our data, we conclude that THC-enriched cannabis oil where THC is the main constituent exerts the optimal anti-obesity effects.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of multiple diseases such as type-2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is well established that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a major role in the development of obesity by regulating appetite, metabolic processes, and energy balance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Dysregulation of the ECS results in a high endocannabinoid 'tone', leading to increased appetite, lipogenesis, adipogenesis, and a decrease in energy expenditure, which further escalates adiposity, thus creating a vicious cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. The central role of this system in obesity development makes it a worthy therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and associated comorbidities.</p><p>The ECS is a complex system comprised of several bioactive lipids of which the two most-studied are N-arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. These bioactive lipids interact with both membrane-bound and nuclear receptors, leading to a broad range of physiological effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The two main endocannabinoid receptors are the G-coupled receptors CB1 and CB2, which are expressed throughout the central nervous system and many other tissues, including organs affecting metabolic homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In recent years, additional receptors and "endocannabinoid-like" mediators have been identified as part of the extended ECS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Among them are congeners of AEA (N-acylethanolamines (NAEs)) and 2-AG (2-monoacyleglycerols (2-MAGs)), and N-acyl-amino acids (NAAs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the link between the ECS and the gut microbiota in relation to obesity. For example, a blockade of CB1 was suggested to ameliorate diet-induced obesity by increasing the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, a commensal Gram-negative bacterium with beneficial effects on metabolism <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>. Moreover, alterations in the ECS are implicated in the dysregulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, gut integrity disruption, and dysbiosis of the gut microflora <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Microbiota composition is altered in obese settings, and compelling evidence suggests that these alterations influence several metabolic pathways that contribute to obesity-induced metabolic disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Decreased alpha diversity and changes in the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes are some of the markers that are associated with obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The ECS can be activated by the consumption of exogenous cannabinoids, such as phytocannabinoids found in the Cannabis sativa (C. sativa) plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The C. sativa plant has been used as an effective therapeutic agent for thousands of years. The plant contains hundreds of natural compounds of which more than 100 have been identified as phytocannabinoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The major two are cannabidiol (CBD) and ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the latter being the predominant psychoactive component in C. sativa. Both demonstrated therapeutic properties in different settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. In recent years, there has been an increase in the use of purified cannabinoids and medical cannabis, mainly in the form of whole plant extracts that contain, in addition to phytocannabinoids, a full spectrum of metabolites with potential therapeutic properties, such as terpenes and flavonoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. For example, cannflavins, prenylated flavonoids found in C. sativa, exert anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting the microsomal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthase-1 and the 5-lipoxygenase activities, leading to reduced PGE2 and leukotriene production, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Medical cannabis is commonly used as an appetite stimulator in pathological conditions such as cancer and HIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Paradoxically, several studies have established the association between cannabis exposure and reduced risk of obesity and metabolic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Moreover, various compounds comprising cannabis, as well as whole cannabis extracts, have been shown to exert anti-obesity properties in animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. In this regard, the effect of THC was suggested to be, in part, due to alterations in the gut microbiota <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>We have recently shown that prolonged oral consumption of purified THC, but not CBD, ameliorates diet-induced obesity and improves obesity-related metabolic complications in a high-fat diet mouse model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. In the same experimental model, we investigated the effect of cannabis-based oil preparations enriched with either THC (Erez) or CBD (Avidekel) on obesity-related metabolic parameters, and these are reported herein.</p><p>To our knowledge, no studies hitherto have examined the effect of commercially available medical cannabis oil-based preparations on obesity parameters in a rodent model. Based on our recent findings and the data stated above, we hypothesize that prolonged exposure to whole plant extracts may produce anti-obesity properties, possibly through alterations in the gut microbiota. In the current study, we investigate the effect of orally administered THC-and CBD-enriched medical cannabis oils (Erez and Avidekel, respectively, provided by Tikun Olam) in mice fed a normal diet or a high-fat diet inducing obesity, with emphasis on microbiota alterations.</p></div>

We performed an alpha diversity analysis, which characterizes the microbiota community in three ways: observed richness, evenness, and Shannon diversity index, a metric that weighs the number of species by their relative evenness data <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In addition, we looked at the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio, which is associated with maintaining homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Four different time points were chosen to assess how diet and treatment influenced microbiota composition. T1 represents microbiota after one month of HFD; T2 represents microbiota one day before the start of treatment; T3 represents microbiota one day after the start of treatment; and T4 represents microbiota on the day of sacrifice.</p><p>At T1, the richness, evenness, and diversity of the microbial community (alpha diversity) in mice fed a high-fat diet was lower compared to mice fed a standard diet, whereas the F/B ratio was increased by a high-fat diet (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5A-D</ref>). In mice fed a high-fat diet, alterations in gut microbiota could be observed within each group and between groups at different time points after treatment commencement (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5E-H</ref>).

Considering treatment as a factor, at T3, a significant shift in microbiota composition could be seen in mice treated with Erez extract compared to Avidekel, indicated by the lower alpha diversity metrics of the former (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5E-G</ref>). No differences were observed between all treatment groups at T4. Mice fed a standard diet exhibited a higher F/B ratio over time, and when considering treatment as a factor, mice treated with Avidekel extract showed a decreased F/B ratio at T4 compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5L</ref>). The gut microbial community of mice fed a high-fat diet, or a standard diet, exhibited a decrease in the relative abundance of bacteroidales at T4, which was accompanied by an increase in Lactobacillales in mice fed a high-fat diet and an increase in clostridiales in mice fed a standard diet (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>).  The gut microbial richness was estimated by observed species; the diversity was evaluated by using the Shannon index; and Evenness was measured by using the Shannon Evenness index.

Interestingly, adipose tissue inflammation was exacerbated in mice fed a standard diet and treated with medical cannabis extracts, especially that of Avidekel, as demonstrated by the elevated mRNA expression of the macrophage markers F4/80 and CD14 and pro-inflammatory cytokine INF-γ. Because Avidekel extract is high in CBD and contains considerable amounts of the terpenes β-Myrcene and β-caryophyllene (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>), all of which possess anti-inflammatory properties, it was expected to have an anti-inflammatory effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Indeed, a previous study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory properties of Avidekel extract, which overcame the bell-shaped dose-response that is typically seen in treatments with purified CBD <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Nevertheless, the majority of publications demonstrated immunomodulatory effects of CBD in pro-inflammatory conditions; however, in basal conditions, CBD can induce a pro-inflammatory response, which is consistent with our observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. It could be speculated that the pro-inflammatory response by the cannabis oil preparations could imply preconditioning of the adipose tissue, enhancing their therapeutic effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Though this subject is beyond the scope of the study, it is worthy of future research.</p><p>Opposing effects of Erez and Avidekel extracts were seen in obesity-induced liver steatosis parameters as the latter demonstrated increased liver weight, lipid droplets, and serum cholesterol levels compared to the former. Overall, Erez extract attenuated liver steatosis, while Avidekel extract increased the severity of liver steatosis as indicated by the low and high steatosis scores. Interestingly, although Avidekel extract and Erez extract contained negligible amounts of THC and CBD, respectively, the liver tissues from both treatments presented considerable amounts of the active molecules and their respective metabolites. Though the large standard deviation can account partially for these results, it is important to consider the implications of the accumulation of THC in certain tissues when consuming CBD-enriched cannabis extracts. The improvement by using Erez extract was associated with decreased levels of the N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), PEA and DHEA. Previous studies have shown that the dietary administration of PEA, an endogenous ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-α, can improve diet-induced metabolic complications, including liver steatosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>. Yet, levels of PEA are increased in cirrhotic liver tissues and in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) which play a crucial role in promoting the pathogenesis of liver disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>. In this regard, the increased levels of PEA in vehicle-treated mice could imply an initial indicator of liver dysfunction, which Erez extract prevented. However, the implication of this finding warrants further investigation. Although DHEA, an ω-3 derived anti-inflammatory lipid mediator, was also significantly decreased by using the Erez extract, the low levels detected in the liver suggest a minor role of this endocannabinoid-like mediator in liver steatosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p><p>Previous studies have attributed the beneficial effect of ECS manipulation in obese settings to changes in the gut microbial community; thus, we aimed to examine changes in the gut microbiota of mice during treatment <ref type="bibr">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. An alteration in the gut microbiota could be seen initially in mice fed a high-fat diet, as indicated by the lower alpha diversity and increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, both of which are linked to obesity-associated dysbiosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Interestingly, a negative shift of the gut microbiota, reflected by the decrease in alpha diversity, was observed after the first administration of the Erez extract compared to the Avidekel extract in mice fed a high-fat diet. This initial effect of Erez extract suggests that the treatment has an adverse effect on the gut microbiota, as alpha diversity is considered the most common indicator to assess gut microbiota health <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. However, this immediate effect did not last, and at the end of the study, no significant alterations could be seen between treatment groups. Moreover, all groups, regardless of treatment, demonstrated a decrease in alpha diversity and an increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio over time, indicating that time was the dominant factor for gut microbiota alterations.</p><p>The current study demonstrates the superiority of THC-enriched cannabis (Erez) extract in preventing HFD-induced weight gain and relieving obesity-induced liver steatosis compared to CBD-rich cannabis extract. In contrast to other publications, our results suggest that the protective effect of Erez extract does not involve changes in the gut microbial community. The improvement in liver steatosis by using Erez extract was concomitant with decreased levels of liver PEA, which could suggest a protective effect on liver function, though this finding could be secondary to the overall effect of Erez extract on obesity.</p><p>In summary, our results, jointly with our previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, provide evidence that THC is the main constituent of cannabis able to exert effective anti-obesity properties. The underlying mechanism requires further investigation.</p></div>
