<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The hypothalamus plays a fundamental role in controlling lipid metabolism through neuroendocrine signals. However, there are currently no available drug targets in the hypothalamus that can effectively improve human lipid metabolism. In this study, we found that the antimalarial drug artemether (ART) significantly improved lipid metabolism by specifically inhibiting microglial activation in the hypothalamus of high-fat diet-induced mice. Mechanically, ART protects the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) neurons surrounding microglial cells from inflammatory damage and promotes the release of TRH into the peripheral circulation. As a result, TRH stimulates the synthesis of thyroid hormone (TH), leading to a significant improvement in hepatic lipid disorders. Subsequently, we employed a biotin-labeled ART chemical probe to identify the direct cellular target in microglial cells as protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ). Importantly, ART directly targeted PKCδ to inhibit its palmitoylation modification by blocking the binding of zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5), which resulted in the inhibition of downstream neuroinflammation signaling. In vivo, hypothalamic microglia-specific PKCδ knockdown markedly impaired ART-dependent neuroendocrine regulation and lipid metabolism improvement in mice. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomics analysis in human brain tissues revealed that the level of PKCδ in microglia positively correlated with individuals who had hyperlipemia, thereby highlighting a clinical translational value. Collectively, these data suggest that the palmitoylation of microglial PKCδ in the hypothalamus plays a role in modulating peripheral lipid metabolism through hypothalamus-liver communication, and provides a promising therapeutic target for fatty liver diseases.</p></div>

Currently, the strategies employed to prevent and manage hepatic lipid metabolism disorders primarily revolve around targeting canonical molecular markers including 3-hydroxy-3methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, peroxidase proliferative activity receptor, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 and lipase <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. However, we still need to explore novel targets that differs from existing mechanisms to overcome potential adverse reactions, such as elevated transaminase levels, rhabdomyolysis, gastrointestinal symptoms, and rash <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that the neuroendocrine system plays a crucial role in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Clinical studies have</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ivyspring</head><p>International Publisher demonstrated that individuals with low levels of thyroid hormone, a significant neuroendocrine messenger, exhibit elevated expression of various mitochondrial enzymes involved in β-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. These enzymes include carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 4 (PDK4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Consequently, these individuals are more likely to experience a disruption in lipid metabolism. Moreover, decreased thyroid hormone level (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) or impaired hypothyroidism may lead to serious hepatic lipid accumulation and lipid metabolites increase, indicating a potential correlation between neuroendocrine signal and fatty liver disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, as a synthetic thyroid hormone, l-thyroxine (l-THY) has been recently found to improve hepatic lipid metabolism and reduce body fat percentage in obese patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Therefore, effective control of neuroendocrine signal especially thyroid hormone level may represent a promising direction for treating lipid metabolism disorders.</p><p>Hypothalamus is a critical brain region that connects the neuroendocrine system to peripheral physiological functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the paraventricular (PVN) nucleus of hypothalamus, TRH neurons secrete TRH, thereby stimulating the production of pituitary thyrotropin (also thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH) for thyroid hormone biosynthesis, including total thyroxine (T4) and total triiodothyronine (T3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Thus, pathological hypothalamus damage such as microglia-mediated neuroinflammation can result in dysfunction of neuroendocrine to cause lipid metabolism disorder and obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In particular, recent studies in molecular mechanism support direct association of high lipid exposure with microglial activation via evoking multiple neuroinflammatory signals including Toll-like receptor, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) cascades <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Hence, these studies provide evidence that neuroinflammation in the hypothalamus, mediated by microglia, is implicated in modulating neuroendocrine signaling to influence peripheral lipid metabolism.</p><p>Extensive research has consistently highlighted the remarkable biological potential of artemisininrelated compounds in various biological processes, including the mitigation of hepatic fibrosis, inhibition of hepatitis, and facilitation of glucose metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. These compelling findings strongly suggest that these compounds may also possess the capacity to augment lipid metabolism. In this study, we discovered that ART, a major derivative of antimalarial drug artemisinin, significantly improved hepatic lipid disorders upon high-fat diet (HFD) exposure via drug repositioning. Unexpectedly, ART did not directly regulate lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, but specifically inhibited microgliamediated neuroinflammation in the hypothalamus to protect adjacent TRH neurons, thereby regulating neuroendocrine for hepatic lipid disorder improvement. Particularly, ART inhibited PKCδ palmitoylation by blocking the palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5 binding, which resulted in neuroinflammation suppression and lipid metabolism improvement. PKCδ-specific knockdown in hypothalamic microglia also significantly reversed ART-dependent hepatic lipid metabolism improvement in mice. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomic analysis of clinical brain tissue also observed a previously unappreciated association of PKCδ level in active microglia with dyslipidemia patients.</p><p>Collectively, microglial PKCδ in hypothalamus holds promise as a potential therapeutic target for enhancing lipid metabolism, particularly in fatty liver diseases, which differs significantly from current concepts of lipid metabolism regulation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drug Repositioning Identifies Antimalarial Drug ART as a Lipid-Lowering Agent</head><p>Drug repositioning is a promising strategy to develop novel treatments for metabolic diseases, thus improving traditional drug development <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. HFD-fed mice were utilized as an experimental model to investigate lipid metabolism, specifically focusing on lipid metabolism disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. To explore whether antimalarial drug ART attenuated HFDinduced lipid metabolism disorder, C57BL/6J mice were fed either a control diet or a HFD for 5 weeks with ART treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>-1D, HFD treatment significantly promoted serum total cholesterin (TC), total glyceride (TG) and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterin (non-HDL-C) levels, which were suppressed by ART in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, oil red O staining showed that HFD treatment promoted lipid droplet accumulation in liver, which was markedly reversed by ART (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). H&amp;E staining also showed that ART ameliorated lipid metabolism disorder-associated steatosis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>). Further, quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of lipid-metabolism-related genes, namely carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (Cpt1a) and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (Ppara) in the livers of subjects receiving ART treatment. Additionally, the expression of the lipid synthesis gene, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (Scd1), which is upregulated by HFD treatment, was observed to be down-regulated following oral administration of ART (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>). A similar pattern was observed in the case of lipid-metabolism-related proteins. The administration of ART significantly augmented the expressions of CPT1A and PPARA proteins, while concomitantly suppressing the expression of SCD1 protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>). Meanwhile, we found that ART obviously decreased serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (ALT) and glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase (AST) levels, and normalized hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, confirming an obvious hepatoprotective effect (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>-1I, S1D-S1F). To verify the effect of ART against lipid metabolism disorder, we used another Balb/c mouse strain to test our previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Here, we found ART showed similar improvement effects on lipid metabolism, including blood lipid levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1G</ref>-S1I), hepatic lipid accumulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1J</ref>-S1K), lipid metabolism-related gene expressions, protein expressions and oxidative stress (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1L-S1R</ref>). Taken together, these results indicate that ART serves as a potent lipid-lowering agent that improves hepatic lipid metabolism disorder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ART Improves Hepatic Lipid Disorder through Activating Neuroendocrine System</head><p>To investigate how ART regulated lipid metabolism, we generated the palmitic acid (PA) or oleic acid (OA)-induced human hepatocytes (LO2) model. Nile red staining showed that PA or OA treatment obviously promoted lipid accumulation in LO2 cells, but ART did not prevent these changes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2A-S2B</ref>). Similar observation showed that ART did not block lipid accumulation in PA or OA-induced human HepG2 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C-S2D</ref>). Besides, ART did not show marked effect on Cpt1a, and Ppara gene expressions in PA-induced LO2 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2E-S2F</ref>). In order to gain further insight into the influence of ART on hepatic lipid metabolism, we conducted experiments using primary hepatocytes. The results obtained from our investigation revealed that ART did not enhance the expression of Cpt1a and Ppara genes or proteins when subjected to PA or OA treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2G-S2L</ref>). Thus, these results indicate that ART dose not directly regulate hepatic lipid metabolism.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that small intestinal enterocyte uptake and absorption are associated with the development of lipid metabolism disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. To clarify whether ART affected small intestinal enterocyte uptake, Caco-2 transport experiments were carried out. We found that stearic acid (SA), PA, OA, and cholesterol (CHO) were transported from the apical (AP) to the basolateral (BL) side, which was not affected by ART (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A-S3D</ref>). These results indicate that ART dose not interfere with the intestinal absorption. Besides, ART showed no obvious effect on body weight and food intake (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3E-S3F</ref>).</p><p>We next searched for other underlying mechanisms of ART-mediated lipid-lowering effect. Since neuroendocrine system has been reported to play a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism, we then hypothesized that ART improved lipid metabolism via regulating hormones secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. First, we detected the releases of lipid metabolismassociated hormones, including adrenaline, insulin, and glucagon <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Here, ART did not significantly regulate the levels of these hormones (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A-S4C</ref>). In addition, our findings revealed a significant increase in the level of TRH in the PVN region of mice fed a HFD following treatment with ART (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4D</ref>). Furthermore, our study also demonstrated that ART treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of serum levels of TSH, free total thyroxine (FT4) and free total triiodothyronine (FT3). These observations indicated that ART may improve HFD-induced lipid metabolism disorder through regulating neuroendocrine system (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>-2D and S4E-S4G). In particular, a proof-of-concept experiment using l-THY as a synthetic thyroid hormone was performed on LO2 cells. We found that PA or OA-induced lipid accumulation was significantly suppressed by l-THY (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4H-S4I</ref>). Similarly, l-THY reduced aberrant lipid accumulation in PA or OA-induced HepG2 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4J</ref>-S4K), indicating an essential role of TH in controlling hepatic lipid metabolism.</p><p>To further confirm the association of ART-mediated TH release and lipid metabolism, we next used thiamazole (THI, a thyroid function inhibitor) to treat HFD-fed mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>-2H, THI markedly reversed ART-regulated decrease of TC, TG, and non-HDL-C. Moreover, THI blocked ART-mediated inhibition in hepatic lipid accumulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>-2J and S5A-S5B). Meanwhile, we found THI obviously ablated the ART-decreased Scd1, and ART-increased Cpt1a, Ppara mRNA levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5C</ref>).</p><p>Since thyroid hormone receptors (THRs) are important regulators of energy expenditure and hepatic lipid metabolism, we then tried to explore whether ART-induced TH release improved hepatic lipid metabolism via TH/THRs pathway. In this study, a liver-specific adeno-associated-virus-5-smallshort-hairpin-RNA-TH receptor beta (Ash-Thrb) was developed to specifically target and reduce the expression of THRβ protein. As a result of Thrb knockdown, THRβ protein expression was successfully reduced (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2K</ref> and S5D). Our data suggested that Thrb knockdown reversed ARTmediated down-regulation of TC, TG, and non-HDL-C (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2L-2N</ref>) in Ash-Thrb-injected C57BL/6J mice. In addition, our findings indicate that ART treatment did not exhibit a significant inhibitory effect on hepatic lipid accumulation in the Thrb knockdown model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2O</ref>-2P and S5E-S5F). This observation suggests that the TH/THRs signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of hepatic lipid disorders by ART. Furthermore, we investigated the potential signaling mechanism of TH-mediated lipid metabolism using HepG2 cells. We found that l-THY significantly reduced PA-induced acetyl-histone H3 (K9) and acetyl-histone H4 (K16) in HepG2 cells by blocking the interaction between nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NcoR1) and histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which was previously reported as a fundamental biological pathway for lipid metabolism in livers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5G-S5H</ref>). Besides, Thrb knockdown suppressed l-THY-improved Cpt1a and Ppara mRNA levels (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5I</ref>-S5K) in HepG2 cells, suggesting that TH regulated lipid metabolism through THR-dependent down-regulation of acetyl-histone. Taken together, our data indicate that ART may regulate hepatic lipid metabolism through TH/THR cascade (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2Q</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothalamic Microglia-Mediated Neuroinflammation Contributes to TRH Neurons Injury for Neuroendocrine Control</head><p>The central regulation of thyroid hormones level by TRH neurons in hypothalamus has been widely recognized <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Since microglial activation is highly associated with neuroinflammation and resultant neurons injury, we then speculated that ART may protect hypothalamic TRH neurons via inhibiting HFD-induced microglial activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.

Statistical comparisons were analyzed by one-way ANOVA analysis followed by Student's t-test. Data are presented as mean ± SD. ** p &lt; 0.01.</p><p>As expected, we observed a high Ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expression (a marker for microglia) in hypothalamic PVN of HFD-fed mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>), indicating that lipid metabolism disorder accelerated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. However, ART significantly decreased Iba1 expression and improved microglial morphology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and S6A-S6G). Meanwhile, we also found that HFD-induced microglial inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α, TNF-α and interleukin-6, IL-6) in hypothalamic PVN were decreased by ART (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>-3C and S6H-S6I). Immunofluorescence analysis in the PVN region revealed a colocalization of TNF-α/IL-6 with Iba1, suggesting that microglia predominantly contribute to the production of these inflammatory factors (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6J-S6K</ref>). Furthermore, we found that ART significantly blocked nitrite oxide (NO), TNF-α, and IL-6 production in PA-induced BV-2 and primary microglia (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D-3F</ref>).</p><p>Given that microglia play a significant role in neuroinflammation-induced neuronal damage, we established an experimental model of primary neurons-microglia co-culture (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6L</ref>). In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6M</ref>-S6N, our findings revealed that the conditional medium (CM-PA) derived from microglia treated with PA significantly reduced the viability of neurons derived from PVN and suppressed the expression of TRH. Notably, this detrimental effect was not mitigated by direct treatment with ART. However, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H</ref>-3I, CM-PA treatment decreased neurons viability and TRH expression, which were significantly increased by PA/ART co-treated microglia-derived conditional medium (CM-ART). In vivo, we conducted immunofluorescence staining of TRH and Iba1 in PVN. We observed that the number of TRH-positive neurons around activated microglia (Iba1 positive) markedly decreased, which was improved effectively by ART treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3J</ref> and S6O-S6P). In addition, immunofluorescence staining of TRH and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) showed that ART did not exhibit an apparent effect on the co-expression of TRH and GFAP (a marker of astrocyte) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6Q</ref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in ART-protected TRH neurons in hypothalamic PVN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PKCδ Serves as a Cellular Target against Microglial Activation</head><p>To explore the target proteins responsible for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, we performed thermal proteome profiling (TPP) technology to identify the cellular targets of ART. Then, we totally identified 2292 potential ART-binding proteins by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), and 118 of them were confirmed according to experimental repeatability (Heavy/Light, H/L ratio) and p value (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Out of the initial pool of candidates, a total of 20 potential target proteins were selected for further screening based on their significant contributions to the transcriptional expression profile (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7A</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). This selection process involved utilizing transcriptomics coupled with ConnectivityMap analysis. Next, biological function annotation revealed three major inflammation-associated proteins including protein kinase C δ (PKCδ), Serpinb1a and Serpinb6. In particular, PKC highlights a promising "druggability" in previous reports, hinting that ART may serve as a potential PKC inhibitor (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7A</ref>). Next, NO assay with a pan-PKC inhibitor staurosporine (STAU) also verified PKC as a crucial target associated with neuroinflammatory pathology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7B</ref>).</p><p>PKC family members are divided into multiple subtypes responsible for different biological functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Besides PKCδ, it has been also reported that PKCα, PKCζ and PKCμ are highly associated with inflammation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. To explore the selective interaction of ART with PKCδ, we synthesized biotin-labelled ART probe (biotin-ART, Supplemental Information Reaction) for pull-down analysis. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>-4E and S7C, PKCδ was significantly pulled down by biotin-ART, which was blocked by excess amount of ART. However, ART did not show marked interaction with other PKCs, including PKCα, PKCζ, and PKCμ. In addition, we found that ART significantly prevented PKCδ protein degradation in cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) experiment, but showed no effects on PKCα, PKCζ, and PKCμ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7D</ref>). Similarly, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) analysis demonstrated that ART specially targeted PKCδ to inhibit its proteolysis against pronase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7E</ref>). PKCδ consists of an N-terminal regulatory domain, a C-terminal catalytic domain, and a short ''hinge'' region <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Regulatory domain contained C2-like region and C1 region, while catalytic domain contained C3 region and C4 region. In order to investigate which domain was specially targeted by ART, we truncated PKCδ into PKCδ1, PKCδ2, PKCδ3, and PKCδ4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H</ref>). Pull-down assay revealed that ART specifically interacted with the distinctive C1 domain, but not the C2-like, C3 or C4 domains (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4I-4J</ref>). In sum, our data suggest that PKCδ serves as an essential cellular target of ART in microglia. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PKCδ Senses Lipid by Palmitoylation Modification for Microglial Activation</head><p>Since PKCδ activation serves as a key prerequisite for neuroinflammation, we then explored the regulation mechanism of ART on PKCδ function <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Recent study has shown that protein palmitoylation played an essential role for phosphorylation regulation, and the covalent attachment of PA to cysteine residues (S-palmitoylation) is a widespread modification on proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. First, we observed that PA treatment significantly increased PKCδ phosphorylation in microglia, which was reversed by ART (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). Here, we speculated that PKCδ phosphorylation may be potentially regulated via its prior palmitoylation. To this end, we conducted acyl-biotinyl exchange analysis and observed that PA significantly increased PKCδ palmitoylation in microglia, which was reversed by ART (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref> and S8A). Additionally, an evident increase in PKCδ palmitoylation was observed in the hypothalamus of mice fed a HFD. In particular, we found that PKCδ palmitoylation in hypothalamus was markedly blocked by ART treatment (Figure <ref type="figure">S8B-S8C</ref>). Next, we used 2BP, a protein palmitoylation blocker, to inhibit PKCδ palmitoylation in PA-induced BV-2 cells (Figure <ref type="figure">S8D</ref>). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>, 2BP almost completely abolished ART-mediated PKCδ phosphorylation inhibition. Furthermore, we observed that 2BP treatment significantly reversed ART-mediated inhibition of NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 releases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>-5F), indicating that PKCδ palmitoylation plays a crucial role in lipid-induced microglial activation and neuroinflammation.</p><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism of PKCδ palmitoylation, we performed global proteomics analysis and identified ZDHHC5 as the most significant palmitoyltransferase in hypothalamus by HPLC-MS/MS (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>). We then knocked down ZDHHC5 and found that PA-induced PKCδ palmitoylation was significantly weakened in Zdhhc5 knockdown cells.</p><p>Meanwhile, ART-mediated suppression of PKCδ phosphorylation was also remarkably blocked by Zdhhc5 knockdown (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5G</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure">S8E</ref>), indicating that ZDHHC5-dependent PKCδ palmitoylation contributes to PKCδ phosphorylation. Co-IP experiment also revealed that PKCδ-ZDHHC5 interaction could be pharmacologically inhibited by ART (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5H</ref>). Furthermore, ART lost its inhibitory effect on NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 release upon si-Zdhhc5 treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5I-5K</ref>). Thus, these results reveal that ZDHHC5-dependent palmitoylation is highly involved in PKCδ activation in microglia (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5L</ref>). We next investigated PKCδ-dependent neuroinflammation signaling pathways. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">S9A</ref>-S9B, 3 major inflammatory signaling pathways were enriched by KEGG pathway analysis including NLRP3, NF-κB, and Janus kinase-signal transduce-activator of transcription (Jak-Stat). Next, western blotting was performed to investigate the effect of ART on NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">S9C</ref>, PA increased NLRP3, caspase1, IL-1β and IL-18 levels, which were markedly reversed by ART. Moreover, a marked increase of inhibitor of κB kinase β phosphorylation (pIKKβ), pNF-κB p65 and inhibitor of nuclear factor κBα phosphorylation (pIκBα) expressions was detected in PA group, which was suppressed by ART (Figure <ref type="figure">S9D</ref>). Furthermore, we observed that PA induced an increase in phosphorylation levels of Jak2, Stat5 and Stat3, which was blocked by ART treatment (Figure <ref type="figure">S9E</ref>). Taken together, our data suggest that PKCδ serves as a lipid sensor for microglial activation and neuroinflammation via unique palmitoylation modification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacologically Targeting Microglial PKCδ in Hypothalamus Alleviates Hepatic Lipid Metabolism Disorder in vivo</head><p>First, we investigated whether pharmacologically targeting PKCδ in hypothalamus exhibited an anti-neuroinflammation effect. The Prkcd +/-mouse model was established by CRISPR/Cas9 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10A</ref>). We found that ART exerted an obvious suppression on Iba1 expression in PVN of HFD-fed Prkcd +/+ mice, which was significantly reversed in Prkcd +/-mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10B-S10E</ref>). Moreover, ART blocked TNF-α and IL-6 release in PVN of HFD-fed Prkcd +/+ mice, but showed less effect in Prkcd +/-mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10F-S10G</ref>). Furthermore, pharmacokinetic analysis of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) transport of ART revealed that ART could pass through BBB and accumulated in hypothalamus (S10H). These data indicate that ART may exert an anti-neuroinflammation effect in hypothalamus through targeting PKCδ.</p><p>To further confirm whether ART inhibited hypothalamic neuroinflammation by selectively targeting PKCδ in microglia of PVN, a microgliaspecific adeno-associated-virus-5-small-short-hairpin-RNA-Prkcd (Ash-Prkcd) was designed for stereotaxic intracranial injection into PVN of mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A-6B</ref>). The administration of Ash-Prkcd injection effectively decreased the expression of PKCδ in microglia located in the PVN region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10I</ref>). Similarly, we also found that ART effectively reduced HFD-induced Iba1 production in Ash-negative-control (Ash-NC)injected group, which was not obviously affected by ART in Ash-Prkcd-injected group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref> and S10J-S10L). In addition, ART markedly reduced hypothalamic inflammatory mediator in Ash-NCinjected group including TNF-α and IL-6, which was effectively reversed in Ash-Prkcd-injected mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D-6E</ref>). Taken together, our data suggest that ART selectively targets microglial PKCδ in hypothalamus in vivo to suppress neuroinflammation.</p><p>Then, we attempted to test whether pharmacologically targeting PKCδ exerted lipid-lowering effect. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6F</ref>-6I and S10M, ART markedly increased TRH neurons number in NC-injected PVN, thereby promoting thyroid hormone production. However, similar effect was not observed in Ash-Prkcd-injected mice. Moreover, HFD-induced TC, TG, and non-HDL-C levels were significantly ameliorated by ART in Ash-NC-injected mice, while ART treatment did not display similar therapeutics in Ash-Prkcd-injected mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6J-6L</ref>). Meanwhile, ART improved HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and lipid metabolism-related gene expressions in Ash-NC-injected mice; however, Ash-Prkcd injection reversed ART-dependent therapeutic effects (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6M</ref>-6O and S10N-S10O). Furthermore, ART decreased ALT and AST levels in Ash-NC-injected mice, which was also ablated in Ash-Prkcd-injected mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6P-6Q</ref>). To exclude the direct effect of PKCδ on lipid metabolism of hepatocytes, we then down-regulated PKCδ expression in HepG2 and LO2 cells, and found that ART did not show obvious regulation effect on lipid accumulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11A-S11D</ref>). Collectively, our results suggest that microglial PKCδ in hypothalamus represents a crucial target for alleviating hepatic lipid disorder in vivo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PKCδ is Correlated with the Microglial Activation in the Brains of Hyperlipemia Patients</head><p>To translate our findings, we obtained the brain tissues and serum samples from 5 control donors and 5 individuals with hyperlipemia (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref>). Immunohistochemistry and western blotting results showed that PKCδ, pPKCδ and plam-PKCδ levels were all higher in the brains of hyperlipemia patients (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B-7C</ref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the colocalization of pPKCδ with Iba1 in brains with hyperlipemia. This finding suggests a positive correlation between PKCδ activation and microglial activation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>). Meanwhile, we confirmed the decreased TRH levels in hyperlipemia brains (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7E</ref>). Importantly, we also observed a trend but no statistical significance, due to high interindividual variability and a limited number of subjects that TC, TG and LDL-C levels in hyperlipemia patients positively correlated with Iba1 and plam-PKCδ expressions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7F</ref>). Furthermore, TRH level negatively correlated with hyperlipemia severity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7F</ref>). Together, these data indicate that PKCδ-mediated neuroinflammation may be linked to lipid metabolism disorder.  <ref type="figure">(D-E</ref>) TNF-α (D), and IL-6 (E) assay of hypothalamus in Ash-Prkcd-injected C57BL/6J mice treated with HFD or ART (20 mg/kg) (n = 6-10 mice each group).

Statistical comparisons were analyzed by one-way ANOVA analysis followed by Student's t-test. Data are presented as mean ± SD. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01.</p><p>Next, we conducted single-nuclei RNA-seq to characterize cell types in brain tissue (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12A-S12B</ref>). As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12C-S12D</ref>, microglial and neuronal cell clusters presented marked changes in UMAP plots and cell percent between control and patient. These data showed consistently increased PKCδ-associated inflammatory signatures in the microglia of hyperlipemia brains, such as Toll-like receptor, NF-κB, mitogen activated kinase-like protein (MAPK), NOD-like receptor and JAK-STAT pathways (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7G</ref>). In neurons, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis suggested several common neuron survival pathways were down-regulated, which were highly associated with glutamatergic, cholinergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic synapse function. Besides, some neuronal apoptosis pathways such as reactive oxygen species signaling cascade were also up-regulated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12E-S12F</ref>).</p><p>To further conduct detailed transcriptomic analysis of TRH neurons, we carried out the unbiased clustering in the neuronal population. Our result revealed 8 neuron clusters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7H</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12G</ref>). Among the clusters, neurons SAI highly expressed TRH genes and the cell percent decreased markedly in hyperlipemia brain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7I</ref>-7J and S12H). Further KEGG analysis of neurons SAI revealed that TH synthesis was decreased and TH signaling pathway was down-regulated, suggesting that PKCδ-mediated microglial activation may specially cause TRH neurons damage in hyperlipemia brain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7K</ref>). Collectively, these data suggest a clinical association of microglial PKCδ activation in brain with peripheral lipid metabolism disorder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Currently, statins attenuate lipid metabolism disorder mainly through targeting HMG-CoA reductase in hepatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Moreover, fibrates induce lipoprotein lipase expression and promote lipid metabolism by activating PPAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Interestingly, our study has provided intriguing evidence suggesting that ART may regulate hepatic lipid metabolism via the hypothalamus-liver axis, which represents a completely different mechanism. Furthermore, the FDA has granted approval to ART, which has subsequently gained widespread utiliza-tion in clinical practice. Even at high doses, ART has demonstrated a commendable safety profile, as it did not result in significant adverse effects such as elevated transaminase levels, gastrointestinal symptoms, rhabdomyolysis, or rash <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The short terminal elimination half-life of ART suggests that prolonged administration of the drug does not result in significant drug accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Consequently, our findings present a novel avenue for the development of therapeutics targeting metabolic diseases. Meanwhile, the results of our study indicate that there was no significant impact of ART on diet, weight loss, or other symptoms associated with lipid metabolism disorders, indicating a clinically acceptable therapeutic regimen to treat metabolic syndrome in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>A growing body of literature supports the notion that neuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of numerous neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. This study revealed a significant association between hypothalamic inflammation and hepatic lipid metabolism, indicating the regulatory role of neuroendocrine signals. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of hypothalamic neuroinflammation is of great significance to the treatment of lipid metabolism disorder. Besides adrenaline, insulin, and glucagon also function as master regulators of lipid metabolism. However, in our study, the administration of ART did not result in any noticeable impact on the hormone levels, suggesting that the regulation of peripheral lipid metabolism by the hypothalamic TRH neurons-dependent TH signal may operate independently. Particularly, previous reports show that several anti-neuroinflammation drugs exhibit an efficient antihyperlipidemic effect such as baicalein, resveratrol and berberine, which may stimulate our interests to further explore whether these agents are potentially involved in the neuroinflammation progress for improving lipid metabolism disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</p><p>Palmitoylation is one of major protein post-translational modifications and highly involved in multiple pathological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Previous studies indicated that protein palmitoylation was a prerequisite for phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Our data suggested that PKCδ phosphorylation was markedly regulated by PKCδ palmitoylation, thereby causing subsequent microglial activation pathways in hypothalamus. These observations indicate that palmitoylation contributes to microglial activation and may function as a potential pharmacological target. Structurally, PKCδ is composed of C1 and C2 domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. Given that ART selectively interacted with the C1 domain of PKCδ, we then speculated that ART may reduce PKCδ palmitoylation via blocking palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5 binding to C1 region, subsequently inhibiting PKCδ phosphorylation in catalytic domain. Therefore, the palmitoylation of PKCδ may serve as a pivotal biological event in microglial activation, which in turn influences peripheral lipid metabolism.</p><p>Due to ethical limitations, we were only able to obtain samples of the patient's cortical tissue for analysis in our study. Nevertheless, our observations consistently revealed a notable correlation between heightened serum lipid levels and the activation of microglial cells, accompanied by a decline in TRH levels within the brain. These findings align with previous studies, substantiating the notion that hyperlipidemia is a contributing factor to augmented PKCδ expression in brain tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. Of note, this observation was further supported by our analysis of single-cell transcriptomics, with a specific focus on the SAI neuronal cluster that highly expressed TRH genes. These data provide a crucial clue of clinical translational value by targeting neuroendocrine system to regulate lipid metabolism disorder in humans. Further, it suggests the possibility of repurposing previous Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs in central nervous system for intervention in lipid metabolism disorders.</p></div>
