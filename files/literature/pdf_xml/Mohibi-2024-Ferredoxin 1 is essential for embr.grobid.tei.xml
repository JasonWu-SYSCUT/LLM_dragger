<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mammalian ferredoxin 1 and 2 (FDX1/2) belong to an evolutionary conserved family of iron-sulfur cluster containing proteins and act as electron shutters between ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) and numerous proteins involved in critical biological pathways. FDX1 is involved in biogenesis of steroids and bile acids, Vitamin A/D metabolism, and lipoylation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes. FDX1 has been extensively characterized biochemically but its role in physiology and lipid metabolism has not been explored. In this study, we generated Fdx1-deficient mice and showed that knockout of both alleles of the Fdx1 gene led to embryonic lethality. We also showed that like Fdxr +/-+/-, Fdx1 +/-+/-had a shorter life span and were prone to steatohepatitis. However, unlike Fdxr +/-+/-, Fdx1 +/-+/-were not prone to spontaneous tumors. Additionally, we showed that FDX1 deficiency led to lipid droplet accumulation possibly via the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathway. Specifically, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 deficiency led to alterations in several classes of lipids, including cholesterol, triacylglycerides, acylcarnitines, ceramides, phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Taken together, our data indicate that FDX1 is essential for mammalian embryonic development and lipid homeostasis at both cellular and organismal levels.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Ferredoxin (FDX) proteins are a family of redox proteins present in all branches of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023)</ref>. They contain iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters that aid in their function of transferring electrons from NADPH via ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) to systems involved in various biological processes including iron sulfur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis, steroidogenesis, bile acid production and vitamin metabolism. Mammalian cells contain two ferredoxins, FDX1 and FDX2, both of which are localized to mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Sheftel et al., 2010)</ref>. Although they have high homology in primary and three-dimensional structures, they differ significantly in their substrate identity and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023)</ref>. FDX2 is critical in the formation of Fe-S clusters in mitochondria by donating electrons to iron sulfur cluster assembly complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023)</ref>. FDX1, on the other hand, donates its electrons to various cytochrome p450 systems present in mitochondria and is involved in production of steroid hormones from cholesterol (steroidogenesis), bile acid production, addition of heme α to Cytochrome c as well as Vitamin A/D metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023)</ref>. Recently, FDX1 has been shown to regulate the process of lipoylation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, especially pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tsvetkov et al., 2022)</ref>. Lipoylation is essential for the function of these enzymes. Moreover, FDX1 has emerged as the central player in the regulation of a new form of cell death, called cuproptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Tsvetkov et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tsvetkov et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Lipids consist of a myriad group of biomolecules essential for various cellular processes, including membrane formation, energy storage and cellular signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Snaebjornsson et al., 2020)</ref>. Some vital lipids, such as triaclyglycerides (TAGs), cholesterol, cardiolipins (CLs) and phospholipids, are essential for cell survival. Due to the essential role of lipids in maintaining normal physiology, aberrant lipid homeostasis has been involved in various disease pathologies, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Broadfield et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hoy et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Snaebjornsson et al., 2020)</ref>. Altered lipid metabolism is also linked with systemic inflammation and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Carotti et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hoy et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pei et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Singla et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>SREBP1/2 are considered master regulators of lipid metabolism and often associated with altered lipid homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Osborne and Espenshade, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shao and Espenshade, 2012)</ref>. In physiological conditions, when intracellular cholesterol levels are depleted, SREBP1/2 are activated through the release of their N-terminal domains by proteolytic cleavage. The N-terminal domains are then translocated to nucleus where a set of genes involved in lipid metabolism are induced by SREBP1/2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Osborne and Espenshade, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shao and Espenshade, 2012)</ref>. However, in diseased conditions, SREBP1/2 are constitutively activated via various mechanisms, resulting in abnormal lipid production and accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Osborne and Espenshade, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Shao and Espenshade, 2012)</ref>. SREBP1 is expressed as two isoforms, SREBP 1 a and 1 c, both of which are transcribed from the SREBF1 gene but through two separate promoters. SREBP-2 is encoded by the SREBF2 gene. SREBP-1c preferentially regulates genes for synthesis of fatty acids (FAs) and TAGs whereas SREBP-2 preferentially regulates genes for cholesterol synthetic pathway, including the mevalonate pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brown and Goldstein, 1997)</ref>. SREBP-1a has overlapping functions with both SREBP-1c and SREBP-2.</p><p>FDXR transfers electrons from NADPH to FDX1, which then delivers the electrons to either COX15, lipoyl synthase or seven different mitochondrial cytochromes, thus supporting the biosynthesis of heme α, lipoic acid, steroid hormones, bile acid, and Vitamin A/D metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023)</ref>. We previously showed an essential role of FDXR in mammalian embryonic development and lipid metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. As FDX1 is a substrate of FDXR in regulating steroidogenesis, we asked whether FDX1 is necessary for mammalian embryonic development and lipid metabolism. We showed that mice homozygous for Fdx1 deletion are embryonically lethal at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5). We also showed that Fdx1 +/-+/-have a short life span and are prone to steatohepatitis, but not to spontaneous tumors. Like FDXR, FDX1 was found to regulate lipid metabolism due to increased activation of the SREBP1/2 pathways. Moreover, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 loss leads to alterations in several classes of lipids.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Fdx1 -/-embryos die between E10.5 and E13.5</p><p>Although FDX1 has been extensively studied biochemically, its role in development and physiology has been unexplored. To determine physiological function of FDX1, we generated Fdx1 heterozygous mice using the knock-out first approach (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). The Fdx1 +/-+/-developed normally and were fertile. However, inter-breeding of Fdx1 +/-+/-to obtain Fdx1 -/-mice was unsuccessful. Out of the 67 pups obtained from the Fdx1 +/-+/-inter-breeding, none were of the Fdx1 -/-genotype (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1C</ref>), suggesting complete loss of Fdx1 leads to embryonic lethality. To determine at what developmental stage the embryonic lethality occurs, we isolated embryos following timed pregnancies. We did not find any Fdx1 -/-embryos at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) but found one at E10.5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1C</ref>), suggesting Fdx1-KO is lethal for embryos between E10.5-E13.5. Although, the size of WT and Fdx1 +/-+/-at E10.5 was comparable, Fdx1 -/-embryos were small and abnormal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). Interestingly, this embryonic lethality is commensurate with that observed with the embryonic lethality of Fdxr-KO at E8.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. These results suggest that Fdx1 and Fdxr regulate similar processes required for mammalian embryonic development and survival.</p><p>Mice deficient in Fdx1 have shorter lifespan and are prone to steatohepatitis/steatosis Although Fdx1 -/-mice were embryonically lethal, Fdx1 +/-+/-were viable. Thus, to study the effect of Fdx1 loss on the long-term survival as well as predisposition to tumors and other abnormalities, we generated a cohort of Fdx1 +/-+/-. Since Fdxr catalyzes the transfer of an electron from NADPH to Fdx1, we compared the phenotypes between Fdx1 +/-+/-and Fdxr +/-+/-from our previous studies The online version of this article includes the following source data for figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1:</ref> Source data 1. Unedited DNA gel images for Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">1B</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. To minimize the number of animals used, the data for the WT mice were adapted from two previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Yang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>, as all the mice were derived from the same C57BL/6 background and maintained in the same facility. Moreover, to avoid any influences from sex differences, all the mice cohorts were kept at close to equal ratio of male:female mice.</p><p>Previously, we found that Fdxr +/-+/-had a short life span compared to WT mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. Here, we found that the median lifespan for Fdx1 +/-+/-(73 weeks) was significantly shorter than that for WT mice (117weeks) and even shorter than that for Fdxr +/-+/-(102weeks) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>-source data 3). To examine if the Fdx1 +/-+/-were tumor-prone, we performed histological analysis. Fdxr +/-(26 out of 29) mice were tumor-prone as compared to WT mice (11 out of 51) (p&lt;0.00001 by Fisher's exact test). However, the overall incidence of spontaneous tumors was not statistically significant between Fdx1 +/-+/-(11 out of 26) and WT mice (11 out of 51) (p=0.0673 by Fisher's exact test) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>-source data 3). Nevertheless, like Fdxr +/-+/-, Fdx1 +/-+/-showed significantly higher incidences of adenocarcinomas and sarcomas as compared to WT mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B-D</ref>). Out of the three Fdx1+/-mice that developed adenocarcinomas, two had lung adenocarcinomas and one had adenocarcinoma associated with the gastrointestinal tract (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>-source data 3C).</p><p>Previously, we showed that mice deficient in Fdxr were prone to liver steatosis and inflammation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2E</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>-source data 3A,B; <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zhang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. Since Fdxr and Fdx1 are necessary for steroidogenesis/lipid metabolism, we next examined whether Fdx1 +/-mice are susceptible to liver abnormalities. Indeed, we found that like Fdxr +/-+/-, Fdx1 +/-+/-were highly prone to liver steatosis/steatohepatitis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2E</ref>-F, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>-source data 3C). As steatohepatitis often leads to liver cirrhosis and eventually liver failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Sanches et al., 2015)</ref>, we conclude that the high incidence of steatosis/steatohepatitis are likely responsible for the shorter lifespan observed in Fdx1 +/-+/-. Of note, we did not observe any variations in phenotypes based on any sex differences in our studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lack of FDX1 leads to altered lipid metabolism possibly via the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathway</head><p>We previously showed that FDXR regulates lipid metabolism via SREBP1/2 pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2022)</ref>. Given that FDX1 is a substrate of FDXR during steroidogenesis, FDX1 might be involved in lipid metabolism via the same pathway. To test this, we generated Fdx1 +/-mouse embryo fibroblasts (+/-). As Fdx1 +/-+/-are lethal at E10.5, we were only able to obtain Fdx1 +/-+/-. As expected, the levels of Fdx1 protein in Fdx1 +/-+/-were approximately half of that in WT MEFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>). To examine whether loss of FDX1 alters lipid metabolism, Nile Red (9-diethylamino-5H-benzo[a]phenoxazine-5-one) staining, which stains lipid droplets, was performed on these cells. We found intense Nile red staining in the cytoplasm of Fdx1 +/-+/-, suggesting accumulation of lipid droplets in Fdx1-deficient MEFs as compared to WT MEFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>).</p><p>To confirm the role of Fdx1 in lipid metabolism in other murine cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knock-out Fdx1 in mouse FL83B hepatocytes and SCp2 mammary epithelial cells. Unfortunately, we were not able to obtain any Fdx1-KO clones in both cell lines, indicating a requirement of Fdx1 for cell survival (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref> and<ref type="figure">G</ref>). Interestingly, along with the expected decrease in Fdx1 protein levels, we observed lower levels of Fdxr protein in Fdx1 +/-+/-as compared to isogenic control cells, suggesting that Fdx1 regulates Fdxr expression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). Next, we performed Nile red staining to examine lipid droplet accumulation in these cells. We found that loss of Fdx1 led to increase in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of FL83B and SCp2 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref> and<ref type="figure">I</ref>), consistent with the observation in MEFs that loss of Fdx1 leads to aberrant lipid metabolism.</p><p>To investigate whether Fdx1 modulates lipid metabolism via the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathway, we cultured FL83B cells in serum-free medium, which mimics depletion of cholesterol response. First, we examined whether Fdx1 deficiency has an effect on the level of ABCA1, a cholesterol efflux pump, which is known to be regulated upon Fdxr deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Yamauchi et al., 2015)</ref>. We found that Fdx1 deficiency led to decreased expression of ABCA1 protein (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). Moreover, the mature nuclear form of SREBP2 protein, which is known to be increased once ABCA1 expression is decreased <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Moon et al., 2019)</ref>, was increased upon Fdx1 deficiency (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). Furthermore, we examined if Fdx1 deficiency affects the maturation of SREBP1, which is mainly involved in the fatty acid  and triacylglyceride (TAG) synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Shimano et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Shimano et al., 1996)</ref>. We found that the mature form of SREBP1 was only slightly increased in Fdx1-deficient cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). As the maturation of SREBP2 was very robust in Fdx1-deficient cells, we further tested the induction of mevalonate decarboxylase (MVD), an SREBP2 target involved in ATP-dependent decarboxylation of mevalonate pyrophosphate to form isopentenyl pyrophosphate <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hinson et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Michihara et al., 2001)</ref>. We found that MVD was increased in Fdx1-deficient cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>), indicating that the mature nuclear form of SREBP2 protein induced by Fdx1 deficiency is transcriptionally active.</p><p>Next, we used HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells to determine if the effect of FDX1 on lipid metabolism observed in murine cells is conserved in human cells. We again employed the CRIS-PR-Cas9 system to knock out the FDX1 gene in HCT116 cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. Surprisingly, unlike murine cells, we were able to obtain complete knock-out of FDX1 in human cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>). Nevertheless, we found that like in murine cells, loss of FDX1 led to increased activation of the SREBP1/ SREBP2 pathways in HCT116 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B-C</ref>). Furthermore, lipid droplets were increased in the FDX1-KO HCT116 cells compared to isogenic control cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4D</ref>). Since Nile Red is not specific to certain lipids and can recognize several intracellular neutral lipids, including TAGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Greenspan et al., 1985)</ref> and sterol esters/cholesterol esters (CEs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Genicot et al., 2005)</ref>, in vitro enzymatic assays were performed to specifically measure the levels of TAGs and cholesterol in these cells. We found that the intracellular levels of both cholesterol and TAGs were significantly upregulated in FDX1-KO HCT116 cells compared to isogenic control cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4E</ref> and F), confirming aberrant lipid metabolism upon loss of FDX1.</p><p>As loss of FDX1 promotes lipid droplet accumulation, we wanted to investigate if overexpression of FDX1 would decrease lipid droplet accumulation. To test this, FDX1 was inducibly expressed under the control of the doxycycline-regulated promoter in HCT116 cells. Treatment with doxycycline led to robust overexpression of FDX1 in these cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>-figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">supplement 1A</ref>). Next, we examined lipid droplet accumulation in these cells with or without FDX1 induction using Nile red staining. We found that overexpression of FDX1 decreased lipid droplet accumulation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>-figure supplement 1B). Together, we demonstrated that FDX1 is involved in lipid metabolism possibly via SREBP1/2 pathways in both murine and human cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Loss of FDX1 alters the lipidome in HCT116 cells</head><p>As loss of FDX1 appeared to alter lipid metabolism, we wanted to examine which classes of lipids are altered by FDX1 deficiency. For this, untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed with isogenic control and FDX1-KO HCT116 cells. A total of 710 lipids were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS, including cholesterol, TAGs, fatty acids, cardiolipins, acylcarnitines (CARs), ceramides (CERs), various phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Consistent with the data measured by the enzymatic assay (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4D</ref>), untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that the levels of cholesterol were highly increased in FDX1-deficient cells as compared to that in isogenic control cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5A</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>-figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">supplement 1A</ref>). In addition, loss of FDX1 led to a significant increase in the content of acylcarnitines (CARs) and phosphotidylcholines (PCs) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5C</ref>-D; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>-figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">supplement 1B-C</ref>) but a marked decrease in lysophosphotidylcholine (LPCs), lysophosphotidylethanolamine (LPEs) and ceramides (CERs) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5E</ref>-G; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>-figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">supplement 1D-F</ref>). On the other hand, we did not observe any significant difference in the levels of phosphotidylethanolamines (PEs), cardiolipins, sphingomyelins (SMs), fatty acids (FAs), and diacylglycerols (DAGs) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5H-L</ref>). Interestingly, while the level of TAGs was found to be increased by the enzymatic assay (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4E</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>-figure supplement 1G), the level of TAGs was found to be decreased by untargeted lipidomic analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5B</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>-figure supplement 1G), suggesting that glycerols from other complex lipids may have been recognized by the enzymatic assay as TAGs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Kapoor and Gupta, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Haupt and</ref> Source data 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>FDX1/2 transduce an electron from FDXR to various effector protein complexes. FDX1 is suggested to be involved in sterol hydroxylation and cholesterol side chain cleavage <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023)</ref>. Recent studies indicate that FDX1 plays a critical role in the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation via lipoylation of key TCA cycle enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tsvetkov et al., 2022)</ref>. Although FDX1 has been extensively characterized biochemically, its role in physiology and lipid metabolism has not been explored. In this study, we generated mice deficient in Fdx1 and showed that homozygous Fdx1 deletion led to embryonic lethality at E10.5. We also showed that Fdx1 +/-+/-had a short life span and developed steatohepatitis, which is similar to the phenotypes exhibited by Fdxr +/-+/-. Moreover, Fdx1 deficiency led to lipid droplet accumulation in both murine and human cells, possibly via the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathways. Consistently, untargeted lipidomic analysis showed that FDX1 deficiency led to alterations in several classes of lipids, suggesting the role of FDX1 in lipid metabolism.</p><p>The embryonic lethality by complete loss of Fdx1 is similar to what we previously showed by complete loss of Fdxr, the latter of which was attributed in part to iron overload <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. However, as FDX1 is not a major player in Fe-S cluster synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023)</ref>, the lethality could be due to lack of progesterone production by placenta, which is required for the maintenance of pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Miller and Auchus, 2011)</ref>. Thus, Fdx1 -/-embryos would not be able to survive due to a miscarriage. However, since mice with complete deletion of Cyp11a1 (Cytochrome p450scc), which is essential for progesterone production, can survive till birth <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hu et al., 2002)</ref>, we postulate that other pathways may be responsible for the lethality of Fdx1 -/-embryos. Additionally, since Fdx1 -/-embryos developed abnormally, we postulate that FDX1 may be required for proper embryo growth, consistent with a recent observation that loss of FDX1 would lead to defects in lipoylation of key TCA cycle enzymes and subsequent loss of oxidative phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tsvetkov et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We observed that Fdx1 +/-+/-were not prone to spontaneous tumors, which is different from tumorprone Fdxr +/-+/- <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. Nevertheless, Fdx1 +/-+/-exhibited a higher incidence of adenocarcinomas and sarcomas compared to WT mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). One possible explanation is that loss of Fdxr leads to decreased expression of p53 tumor suppressor whereas loss of Fdx1 alone does not have a significant effect on p53 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. We also observed that murine cells deficient in both alleles of the Fdx1 gene are not viable, which is consistent with the observation that Fdx1-KO embryos die between 10.5 and 13.5 days post-fertilization (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). However, both our own and others' published studies showed that FDX1-KO human cells are viable <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Schulz et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tsvetkov et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhang et al., 2017)</ref>. One possible explanation is that human FDX2, but not murine Fdx2, may be able to compensate for loss of FDX1 for cell survival, which is worth further investigation.</p><p>Murine and human cells deficient in FDX1 showed increased lipid accumulation possibly via activation of the ABCA1-SREBP1/2 pathways, which was again consistent with the loss of FDXR <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Zhang et al., 2022)</ref>. In order to identify specific classes of lipids altered upon loss of FDX1, lipidomic analysis was performed and showed that the levels of cholesterol, triacylglycerols, acylcarnities, phospholipids, and lysophospholipids were significantly altered by the loss of FDX1. Thus, altered lipid metabolism is likely responsible for steatohepatitis observed in Fdx1-deficient mice. Steatohepatis is a progressive disease that initiates with the accumulation of excessive fat in the liver (steatosis; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shao et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Vanni et al., 2010)</ref>. The fat accumulation would induce liver inflammation, leading to steatohepatitis, referred to as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These data clearly indicate that FDX1 is involved in cellular and physiological lipid homeostasis and that loss of FDX1 leads to development of pathological impairment in mice. Although previous studies showed that FDX1 is involved in cholesterol metabolism, the observations in this study raise a critical question about how FDX1 regulates the metabolism of the various classes of lipids. Thus, further studies are warranted to address this issue.</p><p>Aberrant lipid metabolism has emerged as a key player in the intricate landscape of oncogenesis, contributing to the development and progression of various cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Santos and Schulze, 2012)</ref>. Aberrant regulation of lipid metabolism pathways, such as altered fatty acid synthesis, increased cholesterol metabolism, and disrupted lipid signaling, have been implicated in tumorigenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Huang et al., 2020)</ref>. Additionally, aberrant lipid metabolism can influence signaling pathways crucial for cell proliferation, survival, and migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Broadfield et al., 2021)</ref>. Although, the overall tumor penetrance in Fdx1 +/-+/-not significantly altered as compared to WT mice, we indeed observed increased incidences of adenocarcinomas in these mice, which would signal the role of Fdx1-mediated lipid homeostasis in regulation of oncogenesis and warrants further studies.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that FDX1 is essential for mammalian embryonic development and is also critical for the maintenance of lipid homeostasis at cellular and physiological levels.</p></div>
