<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Toll-like receptor (TLR)/myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MYD88) signaling aggravates sepsis by impairing neutrophil migration to infection sites. However, the role of intracellular fatty acids in TLR/MYD88 signaling is unclear. Here, inhibition of fatty acid synthase by C75 improved neutrophil chemotaxis and increased the survival of mice with sepsis in cecal ligation puncture and lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock models. C75 specifically blocked TLR/MYD88 signaling in neutrophils. Treatment with GSK2194069 that targets a different domain of fatty acid synthase, did not block TLR signaling or MYD88 palmitoylation. De novo fatty acid synthesis and CD36-mediated exogenous fatty acid incorporation contributed to MYD88 palmitoylation. The binding of IRAK4 to the MYD88 intermediate domain and downstream signal activation required MYD88 palmitoylation at cysteine 113. MYD88 was palmitoylated by ZDHHC6, and ZDHHC6 knockdown decreased MYD88 palmitoylation and TLR/MYD88 activation upon lipopolysaccharide stimulus. Thus, intracellular saturated fatty aciddependent palmitoylation of MYD88 by ZDHHC6 is a therapeutic target of sepsis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S</head><p>epsis is a life-threatening systemic inflammation due to dysregulation of the host response to bacterial infection and causes more than 250,000 annual deaths in the United States as well as a great medical-care cost burden to patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Numerous clinical trials with the aim of alleviating septic conditions have been unsuccessful <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . Upon infection, neutrophils protect the host using bactericidal signals through interleukin (IL)-8/C-X-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CXCR2) and formylated peptide/formyl peptide receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Under septic conditions, however, such bactericidal activity of neutrophils is impaired because of the uncontrollable activation of inflammatory signaling through TLR/MYD88, making neutrophils less apoptotic and chemotactic <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . Thus, developing methods of suppressing the TLR/MYD88 response without affecting the signaling pathway of CXCR2 or formyl peptide receptor may prevent host damage, while maintaining the antibacterial activity of neutrophils, leading to improved survival of patients with sepsis and breakthroughs in the clinical setting.</p><p>Saturated fatty acid (SFA) activates TLR signaling and generates proinflammatory conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . However, the precise mechanism by which SFA facilitates TLR responses remains poorly understood. Previously, numerous studies have focused on exogenous SFA, which has been suggested to directly stimulate TLR <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> or to change the lipid raft composition of the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . However, a recent paper challenged the current concept, with structural evidence showing that SFA is not a TLR4 agonist, suggesting a different method of activating TLRs by SFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . In contrast, fatty acid synthase (FASN) generates endogenous de novo fatty acids that are also important regulators of signal transduction; emerging evidence suggests that endogenous fatty acids regulate inflammation and the immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . We predicted that fatty acids can modulate TLR signaling in a different manner from the established route.</p><p>Endogenous fatty acids synthesized by FASN can be converted to palmitoyl-CoA and incorporated into cysteine residues of the protein via thioester linkage in a process known as S-palmitoylation. Extensive studies have revealed diverse roles of palmitoylation in protein trafficking and subcellular localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . However, very little is known about whether palmitoylation directly influences inflammatory signaling, particularly TLR/MYD88 signaling, and whether it is dynamically regulated in the immune system.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that treatment with C75 (1), an FASN inhibitor, enhanced the chemotactic activity of neutrophils and improved the survival of mice under septic conditions in vivo.</p><p>In vitro experiments showed that MYD88, a common adapter molecule in the TLR family, was palmitoylated. By comparing the effects of different FASN inhibitors, we demonstrated that MYD88 palmitoylation is affected by both de novo fatty acid synthesis and CD36mediated exogenous fatty acid incorporation. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that MYD88 was palmitoylated at cysteine 113 and cysteine 274. The ZDHHC6 enzyme was the strongest candidate for MYD88-specific palmitoyl-acyl transferase (PAT). In vitro analyses of MYD88 palmitoylation after treatment with FASN inhibitors, cysteine mutagenesis or PAT knockdown decreased the TLR4 response, revealing a novel regulatory mechanism of inflammation.</p></div>

To investigate the potential role of endogenous fatty acid synthesis in inflammation, C57BL/6J mice subjected to a cecal ligation puncture (CLP) were treated with C75 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1a</ref>).

In another in vivo model intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 45 mg kg -1 ), C75-pretreated mice showed better survival (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). LPS-induced inflammation at the bacterial infection site is known to impair neutrophil migration. This process involves p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation that can promote CXCR2 internalization to desensitize bactericidal signals produced by neighboring cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . We found that C75 treatment inhibited LPS-induced internalization of surface CXCR2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>) and improved the chemotactic ability of neutrophils toward only IL-8 in the presence of LPS by blocking LPS-induced activation of TLR signaling (Fig. <ref type="figure">1e</ref>). An enhanced chemotactic response to IL-8 was also observed when FASN expression was downregulated by human short hairpin RNA in a DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cell line (Fig. <ref type="figure">1f</ref>). These data indicate that inhibiting FASN prevents the desensitization of neutrophils, such as internalization of CXCR2, upon bacterial infection. Taken together, pharmacologic inhibition of FASN may play a therapeutic role in vivo by effectively inhibiting septic inflammation and improving survival by modulating TLR signaling.</p><p>FASN inhibitor specifically decreases TLR signaling. To explain the observed in vivo effect of C75 in TLR-mediated inflammation, we isolated neutrophils and exposed them in vitro to three differ-ent stimulants, namely LPS, IL-8 or N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLP). We evaluated whether neutrophil activation was prevented by pretreatment with C75 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . All three stimulants resulted in a dented and activated morphology of neutrophils in the DMSO-pretreated control group; C75 treatment specifically blocked LPS-induced morphological changes, whereas it did not affect IL-8or fMLP-induced neutrophil activation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2a</ref>). We also performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of neutrophil activation, such as the shedding of L-selectin and induction of CD11b. C75, a FASN inhibitor, blocked only LPS-induced neutrophil activation but not IL-8-or fMLP-induced activation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2b</ref>). Furthermore, treatment with C75 effectively blocked LPS-induced p38MAPK activation in neutrophils (Fig. <ref type="figure">2c</ref>). To rule out the possibility that the observed effect was due to C75 toxicity, we analyzed the apoptotic cell population after pretreatment of C75 in human neutrophils and observed no significant difference in the nonapoptotic cell population (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Moreover, gross morphology did not differ between the two groups. Because neutrophils are the first leukocytes to be recruited to an inflammatory site, we used a 'carrageenan-induced air pouch' model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> to determine whether FASN inhibition inhibits TLR-dependent neutrophil migration in vivo. When inflammation was induced by carrageenan to stimulate TLR4 signaling in the air pouch, C75-pretreated mice showed fewer infiltrated neutrophils than DMSO-pretreated mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">2d</ref>). Thus, our results demonstrate that C75 specifically inhibits TLR-induced neutrophil activation in vitro and in vivo. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nature ChemiCal Biology</head><p>In TLR signaling, each adapter is differentially used by different receptor complexes. To further investigate the inhibitory mechanism of C75 in TLR signaling, we used purified Pam3CSK4 (TLR2 agonist), LPS (TLR4 agonist) and R848 (TLR7-8 agonist) to activate different TLR signaling pathways. Agonist-induced neutrophil activation was blocked by C75, maintaining the normal and round morphology of the cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2e</ref>). Transcript levels of the MYD88dependent proinflammatory cytokine TNF messenger RNA were downregulated by C75, while those of the MYD88-independent proinflammatory cytokine IFNB1 mRNA were unaffected in neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). A previous study showed that the MYD88-independent pathway (TLR3) is not activated in mature human neutrophils <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> and our data suggest that C75 inhibits only MYD88-dependent pathways. We therefore hypothesized that C75 acts downstream of a common adapter molecule of TLR signaling, MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FASN regulates MYD88-dependent inflammation.</head><p>To search for a downstream molecular target of C75, we used the nuclear factor (NF)-κB luciferase gene reporter system. At the plasma membrane level, LPS-activated NF-κB luciferase, which was dosedependently blocked by C75 in hTLR4-293T cells. However, at the submembrane or cytoplasmic level, overexpression of MYD88, TRAF6, IKBKB or RELA activated NF-κB luciferase, which was not blocked by C75 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>). Because MYD88 overexpression can cause death-domain self-dimerization and subsequent nonspecific downstream activation independently of TLR <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> , we generated a MYD88-GyrB stable cell line from hTLR4-293T cells by fusing the C-terminus of MYD88 with the subunit of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . MYD88-GyrB dimerizes only on binding with the Streptomyces product, coumermycin (2), and elicits the TLR signal to bypass the TLR4 surface receptor. In the MYD88-GyrB stable cell line, dimerization of MYD88 by coumermycin activated phospho-p65 and degraded IκBα that was dose-dependently blocked by C75 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>). Consistent results were obtained in the NF-κB luciferase assay in which C75 blocked coumermycin-induced NF-κB activation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>) and the reduction in NF-κB activity was similar to that observed following genetic inhibition of FASN with targeting shRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>). Taken together, these results indicate that C75 targets the machinery of MYD88 dimerization such as the intermediate (INT) or TIR domain of MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</p><p>To investigate the direct effect of FASN on MYD88, coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays were conducted. The results suggest a physical interaction between FASN and MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). Because FASN is an enzyme known to produce palmitate as its primary product, we evaluated MYD88 palmitoylation. GPS-Lipid, a free software recently developed for the comprehensive prediction of lipid modification sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , supported our hypothesis that at a default threshold, cysteine at positions 113, 166, 192 and 274 were identified as potent S-palmitoylation sites in the MYD88 protein (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Accordingly, the NF-κB luciferase assay revealed that treatment with a well-known palmitoylation inhibitor, 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) (3), decreased NF-κB activation, while treatment with palmostatin B (4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> that is known to increase steady-state palmitoylation by inhibiting depalmitoylating enzyme acyl-protein thioesterase-1, enhanced NF-κB activation in the MYD88-GyrB stable cell line treated with coumermycin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3d</ref>). Additionally, when all cysteine residues were mutated to alanine (MYD88-CA), both coumermycin-and LPS-induced p38MAPK activation were inhibited (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). The competitive inhibitor of coumermycin, novobiocin, completely blocked coumermycin-induced p38MAPK activation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9c</ref>), confirming that the MYD88-GyrB fusion protein does not exhibit nonspecific activation unless cells are exposed to coumermy-cin stimulation. Therefore, the cysteine residues of MYD88 are important in TLR signaling and FASN-associated palmitoylation may account for the mechanism of MYD88-dependent TLR signaling activation.</p><p>Two sources of palmitate for MYD88 palmitoylation. We used an in vitro acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay and click chemistry method to test the palmitoylation of MYD88. After transiently overexpressing wild-type (WT) MYD88 and CS-mutant MYD88, in which all cysteine residues were mutated to serine (MYD88-CS), we detected a specific band in the hydroxylamine-treated sample of WT MYD88, whereas it completely disappeared in MYD88-CS (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>). Moreover, treatment with 2-BP significantly inhibited WT MYD88 palmitoylation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10a</ref>). The click chemistry method also revealed palmitoylated MYD88 only in the 17-octadecynoic acid (ODYA) (5)-treated group. Treatment with hydroxylamine completely detached 17-ODYA-labeled MYD88, confirming that the detected band was specific for palmitoylated MYD88 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>). Furthermore, an In-Gel fluorescence detection method after the click reaction revealed a distinct band the size of MYD88 in the 17-ODYA-treated group (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10b</ref>), confirming MYD88 palmitoylation. MYD88 palmitoylation was nearly completely blocked 2 h after C75 treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10c</ref>) and was not induced by LPS (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10d</ref>). The observed palmitoylated MYD88 was also detected in endogenous THP-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10e</ref>).</p><p>On the basis of our hypothesis that FASN is required to supply the endogenous fatty acids required for MYD88 palmitoylation, shFASN RAW264.7 cells were generated to evaluate the changes in MYD88 palmitoylation levels. The ABE assay demonstrated that MYD88 palmitoylation was reduced in shFASN cells compared to control cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>). Furthermore, pretreatment with C75 and cerulenin (6) effectively inhibited MYD88 palmitoylation in hTLR4-293T-GyrB cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10f</ref>), suggesting that MYD88 is FASN-dependently palmitoylated. However, treatment with another potent FASN chemical inhibitor, GSK2194069 (7), did not inhibit MYD88 palmitoylation and TLR activation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">11</ref>). Previous studies showed that FASN protein can regulate membrane cholesterol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , which is important for the influx of exogenous palmitate and that different chemical inhibitors that bind to different subdomains of FASN may have different impacts on cholesterol synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . C75 or cerulenin inhibits FASN in the ketoacyl synthase domain, which may decrease the production of acetoacetyl-CoA, a potent precursor of cholesterol synthesis, leading to decreased cholesterol synthesis. In contrast, GSK2194069 inhibits the ketoacyl reductase domain of FASN and increases acetoacetyl-CoA levels, leading to increased cholesterol synthesis. We hypothesized that the FASN protein maintains the total intracellular palmitate pool by both regulating the influx of exogenous fatty acids through membrane cholesterol level and producing endogenous fatty acids. We examined whether treatment with cholesterol reversed the C75mediated inhibition of MYD88 palmitoylation. Treatment with acetoacetyl-CoA, β-hydroxy β-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA and cholesterol reversed C75 inhibition of MYD88 palmitoylation, while treatment with exogenous palmitate alone did not (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4d</ref>). This result suggests that the mechanisms of C75 to inhibit MYD88 palmitoylation are twofold: (1) inhibition of de novo synthesis of endogenous palmitate and (2) suppression of membrane cholesterol contents leading to decreased influx of exogenous palmitate. We hypothesized that, in contrast to C75, GSK2194069 may increase membrane cholesterol leading to the influx of exogenous palmitate. To further validate our hypothesis, we treated MYD88-transfected hTLR4-293T cells with GSK2194069 during culture in delipidated FBS media to block both, de novo synthesis of endogenous palmitates and influx of exogenous palmitate.

Next, to evaluate the effect of blocking exogenous fatty acid transport on MYD88 palmitoylation, we treated the cells with 50 µM of sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) (8), an inhibitor of the long-chain fatty acid transporter, CD36. Either SSO (inhibitor of influx of exogenous palmitate) or GSK2194069 (inhibitor of synthesis of endogenous palmitate) alone slightly decreased the amount of MYD88 palmitoylation. But, combination treatment with SSO and GSK2194069 completely blocked MYD88 palmitoylation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12c</ref>) and LPS-activated TLR signaling (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">12d</ref>). These results suggest that a total intracellular palmitate pool comprising both de novo-synthesized palmitate and incorporated exogenous palmitate is an important source of palmitate-mediated posttranslational modification of MYD88.</p><p>MYD88 is palmitoylated at cysteine 113 and 274. MYD88 protein contains nine cysteine residues, all of which are highly conserved among vertebrates. Only the first residue (C113) resides in the INT domain, while others are within the TIR domain (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">13</ref>). To identify specific palmitoylation sites in MYD88, we performed MS analysis. Briefly, (1) the free sulfhydryl groups were bound and blocked with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM); (2) the palmitoylated cysteine residue was de-palmitoylated by treatment with hydroxylamine; (3) cysteine residues that were initially palmitoylated and then de-palmitoylated with hydroxylamine were bound and marked with N-methylmaleimide (NMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">14a</ref>).

Compared to WT MYD88, all mutant MYD88 (C113A, C274A, C113/274A and CA) showed decreased palmitoylation levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4f</ref>), confirming that the C113 and C274 residues were palmitoylated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IRAK4 recruitment requires MYD88 palmitoylation.</head><p>To evaluate the function of MYD88 palmitoylation, NF-κB luciferase activity was measured using WT and various mutant MYD88-GyrB stable cell lines. The dimerization inducer, coumermycin, activated NF-κB luciferase, which was significantly inhibited in the C113A and CA mutants. As expected, when alanine at position 113 was reversed back to cysteine from the CA mutant (CA113C), NF-κB luciferase activity was rescued (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5a</ref>). Furthermore, p38MAPK signal activation induced by coumermycin in MYD88-GyrB stable cells was effectively inhibited in the C113A mutant and completely inhibited in the CA mutant that was partially rescued in the CA113C reverse mutant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5b</ref>).</p><p>Previous studies suggested that an alternatively spliced variant of MYD88 that lacks an INT domain, negatively regulates IL-1/ TLR signaling because of defective IRAK4 recruitment to the myddosome complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Moreover, amino acids in MYD88 critical for IRAK4 binding (E110, E111 and D112) are adjacent to C113 within the INT domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . We therefore hypothesized that C113 palmitoylation affects IRAK4 recruitment during signal transmission. Compared to WT MYD88, CA and C113A MYD88 failed to interact with IRAK4; however, the CA113C reverse mutant restored the interaction with IRAK4, confirming the importance of MYD88 C113 palmitoylation in recruiting IRAK4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5c</ref>). To rule out the possibility that defective binding with IRAK4 occurs because of structural disruption by alanine mutation, we used a chemical FASN inhibitor and palmitoylation inhibitor, C75 and 2-BP, respectively. Binding of IRAK4 to MYD88 was significantly retarded by C75 or 2-BP, confirming that FASN-dependent MYD88 palmitoylation is crucial for IRAK4 recruitment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5d</ref>). In contrast, MYD88 palmitoylation did not affect its self-dimerization, indicating a specific role for palmitoylation in the INT domain of MYD88 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">15</ref>).

We performed an ABE assay using shZDHHC6 RAW264.7 cells to monitor changes in MYD88 palmitoylation levels.

To validate the functional significance of these results, we designed shZDHHC6 knockdown cell lines and tested the activation of the downstream signal by LPS in shZDHHC6 cells.

We also observed a similar pattern of TLR signaling inhibition using siRNA targeting ZDHHC6 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">19</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>There has been great expansion in our knowledge of fatty acid metabolism and its possible role in modulating inflammatory conditions. However, the direct molecular mechanisms underlying how endogenously synthesized free fatty acids contribute to the innate immune responses remain less well understood. In most cancer cells, de novo fatty acid synthesis is often facilitated to synthesize membranes and signaling molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . In contrast, in normal cells, exogenous lipids act as ligands for nuclear hormone receptors including LXR, RXR and PPARs to transmit proper inflammatory signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> . The possible involvement of endogenous fatty acids in normal cell inflammation has recently been suggested; FASN, a producer of endogenous free fatty acids, is activated in LPS-induced macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Moreover, alternating membrane lipid compositions controlled by fatty acid metabolism are thought to modulate TLR4 signaling in the innate immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . We identified a previously undescribed neutrophil response to the FASN inhibitor C75 which is specific for MYD88-dependent TLR signaling pathways. Our identification of a previously unknown palmitoylation of the common adapter molecule MYD88 provides mechanistic insight into how MYD88-dependent TLR signaling is associated with endogenous fatty acid metabolism.</p><p>Although we identified two palmitoylation sites (C113 and C274) in MYD88 protein, p38MAPK and NFκB-p65 activation was significantly impaired in C113A MYD88. Notably, C113A MYD88 alone showed defective IRAK4 binding, emphasizing the importance of C113 palmitoylation in facilitating TLR signaling. Our finding is consistent with previous findings showing that the INT domain of MYD88 is critical for IRAK4 recruitment and subsequent downstream TLR activation. Because IRAK4 is downstream of MYD88, MYD88 palmitoylation in IRAK4 recruitment is in conflict with the finding that NF-κB activation by MYD88 overexpression was not blocked by the FASN inhibitor. However, even when we mutated the death domain residing in E52 of MYD88 that was previously reported as a key amino acid for IRAK4 binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , to alanine (E52A), NF-κB was activated by overexpression of E52A MYD88. This result indicates that C113 MYD88 palmitoylation in association with IRAK4 is a physiologically relevant mechanism, whereas in vitro NF-kB activation by MYD88 overexpression is independent of IRAK4.</p><p>Intracellular dynamics of palmitoylation are regulated by a family of 23 ZDHHC enzymes that are defined by the presence of a conserved 51-amino acid zinc-finger domain containing a highly conserved DHHC (Asp-His-His-Cys) tetra peptide. Most ZDHHC enzymes localize to cellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . In this study, we showed that ZDHHC6 catalyzes MYD88 palmitoylation and observed downregulated inflammatory responses when ZDHHC6 was knocked down. Some pleiotropic mechanisms may exist to decrease the inflammatory response by knockdown of ZDHHC6, as ZDHHC6 was previously shown to palmitoylate calnexin <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and regulate the functions of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . However, we detected a palmitoyltransferase targeting MYD88 that participates in modulating TLR signaling in the innate immune system. In terms of spatial arrangement, ZDHHC6 localizes primarily in the ER <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> ; how cytosolic MYD88 interacts with ZDHHC6 remains unclear. One possible explanation is the location where MYD88 mRNA is translated. Recent transcriptome-based studies have suggested that not only secretory and membrane-targeted proteins but also cytosolic proteins can be translated in ribosomes associated with the ER <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . We identified a ZDHHC6-MYD88 interaction that regulates inflammatory responses to bacteria, providing insight into how membraneassociated ZDHHC proteins are associated with cytosolic protein and its palmitoylation.</p><p>FASN is involved in S-palmitoylation of important proteins, such as Wnt-1 in prostate cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , endothelial nitric oxide synthase in endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> and Mucin2 in the colonic epithelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . As some proteins were reported to be FASN-dependently palmitoylated <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> , we examined the mechanism of FASN-dependent MYD88 palmitoylation. Our study suggests that FASN plays an important role in maintaining the total intracellular palmitate pool both by de novo fatty acid synthesis and by maintaining exogenous fatty acid uptake via controlling membrane cholesterol levels. Our data are consistent with those in macrophage lineagespecific FASN knockout mice showing an attenuated response to inflammation with changes in lipid composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . We also found that ZDHHC6 is a potent enzyme that palmitoylates MYD88 protein. This model may have clinical implications, as no specific palmitoylation inhibitors have been identified to date. 2-BP is widely used to verify the function of palmitoylation of a specific protein, but it is also a nonselective inhibitor of many lipid enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> . Other drugs such as cerulenin <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> and tunicamycin are indirect palmitoylation inhibitors that inhibit FASN. Although the effects of the C75 inhibitors on cellular physiology were confirmed with genetic inhibition of FASN in our current study, C75 is nonspecific and can activate CPT1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> . This study overcomes these limitations by providing clinically applicable insights into a drug or small molecule which can modulate ZDHHC6 activity for developing a specific modulator of innate immune functions while minimizing off-target effects.</p><p>In summary, our results reveal how bacterial toxin LPS activates NF-κB through TLR4 and MYD88 in neutrophils. The key step is the palmitoylation of C113 in the INT domain of MYD88 by ZDHHC6 enzyme using intracellular palmitic acids either from endogenous fatty acids synthesized by FASN or from exogenous fatty acids supplied by CD36-mediated uptake. In in vitro and animal experiments, blocking MYD88 palmitoylation in neutrophils suppressed TLR-induced inflammation and enhanced the chemotactic activity of neutrophils, improving the survival of mice with sepsis. This study directly demonstrates that endogenous fatty acids modulate innate immune function and suggests a therapeutic niche for controlling sepsis.</p></div>

Full-length MYD88 cDNA was cloned into pCDNA3.1 (Addgene) and pKS-GyrB expression plasmids. The pKS-MYD88-GyrB construct was cloned into pcDNA4-V5/His(A), followed by site-directed mutagenesis to generate pcDNA4-V5/His(A)-MYD88-GyrB WT, C113A, C274A, C113/274A, CA and CA113C. The pcDNA3.1-MYD88 construct was cloned into pCMV-tag2A, followed by site-directed mutagenesis to generate FLAG-MYD88 WT, CA, CA113A and E52A.

The full-length IRAK4-containing plasmid purchased from Addgene (no. 23749) was cloned into the CAG vector. Deathdomain truncated-MYD88 cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA4-V5/His(A) vector to generate truncated-MYD88 WT, CA and CA113A. ZDHHC6 was cloned into the pCAG-FLAG-IP vector. All clones were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing from Macrogen. ABE assay. HEK-293T cells (10 7 ) were seeded into a 100-mm dish overnight. If transfection was required, the cells were transfected with 10 μg of MYD88-GyrB plasmid using polyethylenimine (PEI; 23966; Polysciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were harvested using palmitoylation lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mM Nethylmaleimide (NEM), 1 μM PMSF (all from Sigma), 200x PIC (Biovision), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl. Lysates were sonicated and incubated at 4 °C overnight. These lysates were centrifuged at 13,300 r.p.m. for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was subject to chloroform-methanol protein precipitation (4:1:3, methanol:chloroform:water). Pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS buffer and briefly sonicated. Concentrated proteins were treated with 0.5 M hydroxylamine (159417; Sigma) or Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer (negative control) for 2 h at room temperature. The proteins were precipitated following the chloroform-methanol precipitation method, solubilized in 1% SDS and briefly sonicated. Solubilized proteins were diluted by 1/10 to prepare a 0.1% SDS solution and immunoprecipitated with 40 μl neutravidin agarose (29200; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated beads were washed three times with palmitoylation lysis buffer and eluted with 2x Laemmli sample buffer (S3401; Sigma). Click assay. Click assay was carried out as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> . First, 10 7 cells were seeded into a 100-mm dish overnight and transfected with 10 μg of the WT MYD88-GyrB plasmid using PEI according to the manufacturer's protocol. Next, the cells were metabolically labeled with DMSO or 17-ODYA in 1% BSA DMEM media for 7 h. The DMSO-treated group was a negative control, as only samples labeled with 17-ODYA could undergo the click reaction. The cells were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 200x PIC.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Articles</head><p>Nature ChemiCal Biology was subject to chloroform-methanol protein precipitation and solubilized in 1% SDS buffer and briefly sonicated. Concentrated protein lysates were subject to the click reaction for 1 h with 100 μM TBTA (678937), 1 mM CuSO 4 (C8027), 1 mM TCEP (C4706; all from Sigma) and 20 μM biotin-azide (B10184; Invitrogen). After chloroform-methanol protein precipitation, the precipitated protein was resuspended in 4% SDS buffer and divided in half (100 μl each), and either 400 μl of 0.5 M hydroxylamine or Tris buffer was added to check for cleavage of the thioester bond. After rotating at room temperature for 1 h, chloroform-methanol protein precipitation was performed and the precipitate was solubilized with 1% SDS buffer. The mixture was further diluted 10x with 0.2% Triton X-100/ PBS buffer, and 50 μl of neutravidin beads were added to purify the biotinylated proteins. The samples were rotated for 2 h, washed three times and eluted with 2x Laemmli buffer.</p><p>In-Gel fluorescence click assay. Because TAMRA-azide has an excitation/ emission spectrum of 546/579 nm, we could detect palmitoylated proteins while in the SDS-PAGE gel <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . The cells were transfected with FLAG-MYD88 using PEI. After metabolic labeling with DMSO or 17-ODYA for 7 h, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated first with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (A2220; Sigma), and then subjected to an on-bead click reaction as described in above. The beads were washed three times and eluted with DTT-containing SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE and detected with a fluorescence detector (FluorchemM; ProteinSimple). Sample preparation for MS analysis. HEK-293T cultures were lysed after 30 h of incubation following transfection with FLAG-MYD88, solubilized and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG affinity beads in the presence of 50 mM NEM. After washing with the IP lysis buffer three times at 4 °C, the beads were treated with hydroxylamine buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by NEM or N-methylmaleimide (NMM; Sigma) labeling at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times and eluted with 250 g ml -1 3X FLAG peptide solution (F4799; Sigma). The eluate was separated by SDS-PAGE and the gels were stained with colloidal blue reagent at room temperature overnight, followed by de-staining with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). MYD88-specific bands were excised and subjected to an in-gel trypsin digestion procedure as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . Trypsin-digested peptides were then dried under vacuum and reconstituted with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and water for MS analysis.</p><p>MS and spectral processing. Trypsin-digested peptide samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters) and LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray source at the Korea Basic Science Institute, as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> . Briefly, the peptide solutions (2 μg of total proteins) were separated over 80 min with a solvent gradient of 5-50% (v/v) acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid on a homemade microcapillary C18 column (100 µm, length 200 mm; particle size 3 µm, 125 Å), and then MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired over the entire run time at a resolution of 120,000 (full width at half maximum) for each sample. Data were processed using Xcalibur 2.2 and Tune 2.7 software and raw data were processed using the MaxQuant quantitative proteomics tool (v.1.5.2.8), as described previously with minor modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> , against the human MYD88 isoform 2 sequence downloaded from UniprotKB to identify matched spectra. Cysteine carbamidomethylation (+57.0215), N-ethylmaleimidylation (+125.0477) and N-methylmaleimidylation (+111.0320) were used as variable modifications to identify MYD88-specific modifications. All other parameters were used as defaults, except for a fragment ion tolerance of 0.8 Da and maximum precursor ion tolerance of 25 and 100 ppm for high and low confidence results, respectively.</p><p>RNA knockdown and virus production for shRNA. HEK-293T cells were transfected with 10 μg of psPAX2 (12260), pPMD2 (12259; both from Addgene), and pLKO.1-shRNA plasmid (control-SHC016) or mouse ZDHHC6 (TRCN0000012168 and TRCN0000012172), mouse FASN (TRCN0000075705; all from Sigma) using PEI according to the manufacturer's instructions. The culture supernatant was collected at 48 h after transfection, filtered through a lowprotein-binding 0.22-μm filter and added to target cells for 24 h before selection with 2 μg ml -1 puromycin (Sigma). For the HL-60 cell migration assay, cells were transfected with pLKO.1-shRNA plasmid (control-SHC016) or human shFASN (TRCN0000003127, TRCN000000003128 and TRCN0000003129; from Sigma) by electroporation. For siRNA the experiment, THP-1 cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA control or 50 nM siRNA targeting ZDHHC6 (L-014101-00-0005; Dharmacon).</p></div>

Human neutrophils or DMSO-induced differentiated HL-60 cells were treated with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. The blocking step was performed with blocking solution provided with the kit for 1 h, and then primary antibody (1:50 dilution) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. For MYD88-ZDHHC6 interaction, MYD88 (ab107585; Abcam) and ZDHHC6 (ab237621; Abcam). For MYD88-FASN interaction, MYD88 (sc-8196; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and FASN (3180; Cell Signaling Technology) were used. The samples were washed with wash buffer A three times and with and without the Duolink PLA probe treated for 1 h at 37 °C. The ligation and amplification steps were performed for signal visualization. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (LSM710; Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).</p><p>Cecal ligation and puncture model and LPS-induced sepsis model. The CLP model was prepared as previously published <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> . Briefly, 10-12-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with 3.5% isoflurane followed by ligation and puncture of the cecum using an 18-gauge needle, followed by fluid resuscitation. In the LPS-induced sepsis model, mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS (45 mg kg -1 ; Sigma) and subjected to fluid resuscitation. In both experiments, C75 or DMSO was intraperitoneally injected 4 h before cecal ligation or LPS injection. The bacterial load was evaluated as the counting colony-forming unit (c.f.u.) of aliquots of serial dilutions of peritoneal fluids after incubation for 24 h.</p></div>

A one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used to compare multiple groups in the luciferase assay, Transwell migration assay and flow cytometry. Survival studies were evaluated by the log-rank test (CLP model) and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test (LPS-induced septic shock model). Means were shown ± s.e.m. The differences were considered significant when P values were below 0.05. Data were analyzed and presented with GraphPad Prism software (v.5, GraphPad).</p><p>Reporting Summary.
