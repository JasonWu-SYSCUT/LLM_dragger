<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) recognizes self-DNA and plays intricate roles in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the molecular mechanism regulating the endosomal TLR9 response is incompletely understood. Here, we report that palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) regulates systemic autoimmunity by removing S-palmitoylation from TLR9 in lysosomes. PPT1 promotes the secretion of IFNα by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and TNF by macrophages. Genetic deficiency in or chemical inhibition of PPT1 reduces anti-nuclear antibody levels and attenuates nephritis in B6.Sle1yaa mice. In healthy volunteers and patients with SLE, the PPT1 inhibitor, HDSF, reduces IFNα production ex vivo. Mechanistically, biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that TLR9 is S-palmitoylated at C258 and C265. Moreover, the protein acyltransferase, DHHC3, palmitoylates TLR9 in the Golgi, and regulates TLR9 trafficking to endosomes. Subsequent depalmitoylation by PPT1 facilitates the release of TLR9 from UNC93B1. Our results reveal a posttranslational modification cycle that controls TLR9 response and autoimmunity.</p><p>Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play essential roles in initiating innate immune responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[3]</ref> .

However, the importance of palmitoylation has not been shown in autoimmune diseases such as SLE.</p><p>In this study, we show that S-palmitoylation regulates the TLR9 response in pDCs and macrophages. TLR9 carries at least two S-palmitoylation sites in the ectodomain. The palmitoylation cycle begins in the Golgi, where DHHC3 palmitoylates TLR9 and ends in lysosomes, where PPT1 depalmitoylates TLR9. The TLR9 palmitoylation cycle directly regulates ligand binding and cytokine secretion by pDCs and macrophages. As a result, PPT1 genetic deficiency or PPT1 inhibitors reduce autoantibody levels and attenuate nephritis in a transgenic SLE mouse model. Palmitoylation inhibitors also repress IFNα production by human pDCs from patients with SLE. Our study outlines a posttranslational modification mechanism that regulates the TLR9 response and suggests a potential immunotherapeutic target for treating autoimmune diseases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PPT1 deficiency protects SLE mice from autoantibodies and nephritis</head><p>We previously studied the role of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) in antigen presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . Since we found that PPT1-deficient classical dendritic cells type 1 (cDC1s) were much more efficient at antigen cross-presentation than wildtype cDC1s, we further explored the role of PPT1 in autoimmunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . We crossed PPT1-deficient mice with B6.Sle1yaa mice, which carry the NZM2410/Aeg-derived SLE susceptibility 1 locus (Sle1) and the BXSB/MpJ-derived Yaa-containing Y chromosome (yaa) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">15</ref> . To our surprise, at 16 weeks, Ppt1 -/-B6.Sle1yaa mice exhibited a smaller spleen and fewer splenic lymphocytes than Ppt1 +/+ B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1A</ref>). We next examined a hallmark of SLE, anti-nuclear antibodies (ANAs), using a previously established ELISA method <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">58</ref> . We found that Ppt1 -/-B6.Sle1yaa mice exhibited lower serum anti-DNA antibody levels than Ppt1 +/+ B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1B</ref>). Anti-RNP/Sm antibodies were also lower at 16 weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1C</ref>). The total serum IgG level was also lower in Ppt1 -/-B6.Sle1yaa mice than it was in Ppt1 +/+ B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1D</ref>). These experiments showed that PPT1 regulated ANA levels in B6.Sle1yaa mice.</p><p>Next, we examined nephritis, a lethal clinical manifestation of SLE. Using H&amp;E staining of kidney sections, we found that Ppt1 -/-B6.Sle1yaa mice presented with a smaller glomerulus than Ppt1 +/+ B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1E</ref>). Applying immunofluorescence staining, we found that Ppt1 -/- B6.Sle1yaa mice exhibited less intense IgG and C3 staining in the nephritic glomerulus than Ppt1 +/+ B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1F</ref>). Our data suggested that PPT1 modulated nephritis in B6.Sle1yaa mice.</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the immune phenotype by flow cytometry. The spleens of Ppt1 -/-B6.Sle1yaa mice exhibited fewer CD11b + myeloid cells than those of Ppt1 +/+ B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1G</ref>). Ppt1 -/-B6.Sle1yaa mice also presented with fewer activated CD44 + CD62L -CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1H, I</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S1A-D</ref>). The number of MHCII + CXCR3 + antibodyforming B cells was also reduced in Ppt1 -/-B6.Sle1yaa mice compared to Ppt1 +/+ B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1J</ref>). Our results demonstrated that PPT1 controlled myeloid, effector T-cell and plasma B-cell expansion in B6.Sle1yaa mice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PPT1 inhibitor HDSF suppresses IFNα in SLE patients and SLE pathogenesis in mice</head><p>Since we showed that PPT1 may play a major role in SLE pathogenesis, we investigated the possible therapeutic value of its small molecule inhibitor HDSF <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">59</ref> . First, we obtained peripheral blood from SLE patients and treated their mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with DMSO or HDSF in vitro. Consistent with the effect on mice, PPT1 inhibitors suppressed IFNα production (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>). To examine the therapeutic potential of PPT1 in vivo, we injected HSDF into B6.Sle1yaa mice for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, HDSF-treated B6.Sle1yaa mice presented with a smaller spleen and fewer splenic lymphocytes than DMSOtreated B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2B</ref>). Four weeks after treatment, we began to find that HDSF-treated B6.Sle1yaa mice showed lower serum anti-DNA antibody levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>). Anti-RNP/Sm antibodies in HSDFtreated mice were also lower than that of DMSO-treated B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref>). Eight weeks after treatment, we observed that HDSFtreated B6.Sle1yaa mice exhibited a lower total serum IgG level than DMSO-treated B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2E</ref>). Correspondingly, HDSFtreated B6.Sle1yaa mice presented with a smaller glomerulus and less intense IgG and C3 staining in the nephritic glomerulus than DMSO-treated B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2F,</ref><ref type="figure">G</ref>). Similarly, we detected fewer CD11b + myeloid cells; CD44 + CD62L -CD4 + and CD8 + T cells; and MHCII + CXCR3 + antibody forming cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2H</ref>-K and S2A-D). Our results demonstrated that the PPT1 inhibitor HDSF was effective in controlling autoimmunity in B6.Sle1yaa mice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PPT1 controls the cytokine response by pDCs, B cells and macrophages</head><p>Since pDC-derived IFN-I play an important role in SLE pathogenesis, we further explored the role of PPT1 in pDCs. Using enriched pDCs from healthy volunteers, we found that HDSF markedly reduced IFNα production in human pDCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3A</ref>). PPT1 is highly expressed in cDC1s and our previous study demonstrated that PPT1-deficiency promoted CD8 + T cell response, which is against our current phenotype in SLE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . To explain this contradiction, we began to investigate other cells heavily involved in SLE, such as macrophages, B cells and pDCs. Reanalysis of IMMGEN RNA-seq showed that the Ppt1 transcript level was higher in macrophages (3.3-fold) and pDCs (1.85-fold) than in B cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3A</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">60</ref> . In particular, the Ppt1 transcript level was upregulated again in pDCs after CpG A stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref>). This increase occurred at the same time that the Ifna transcript was produced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3B</ref>), before IFNα protein was secreted by pDCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3B</ref>). In order to study the function of PPT1 in pDCs, we FACS-sorted bone marrow pDCs from PPT1-deficient mice, and measured their IFNα and TNF secretion ex vivo after TLR9 or TLR7/8 stimulation. CpG A stimulation of pDCs ex vivo yielded copious amounts of IFNα, while CpG B and R848 activation yielded mostly TNF <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">17</ref> . PPT1-deficient pDCs produced less IFNα and TNF than littermate wild-type controls, as measured by ELISA and intracellular staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3C</ref> and S3C, D). To observe the effect of PPT1 on pDC function in vivo, we infected PPT1-sufficient and PPT1deficient mice with herpes simplex virus (HSV, Type I), a DNA virus. We observed a reduced IFNα serum concentration in PPT1-deficient mice after infection with HSV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3D</ref>). pDCs are known to die after sufficient activation by IFN-I <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">61</ref> . Correspondingly, pDC cell number was higher in PPT1-deficient mice than PPT1-sufficient mice after infection with HSV (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3E</ref>). Although pDCs are thought to be the predominant producers of IFNα in the early antiviral response, it has been difficult to ascertain the cellular sources of serum IFNα <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">62</ref> . Therefore, we generated BDCA2-DTR:Ppt1 +/+ and BDCA2-DTR:Ppt1 -/-mixed chimeras to modulate PPT1 expression in pDCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3F</ref>). After HSV infection, the level of IFNα secreted by PPT1-deficient pDCs in vivo was reduced compared to that of the mixed chimera controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3G</ref>). Here, we showed that PPT1 regulated IFNα and TNF production by pDCs. In addition to pDCs, we also examined the role of PPT1 in B cells and macrophages. We treated B220 + CD19 + B cells, peritoneal cavity macrophages (Per.MΦ) and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Ppt1 +/+ and Ppt1 -/-mice with TLR9 agonists, and found that PPT1deficient B cells secreted less IL-6 and PPT1-deficient macrophages less TNF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3E</ref>). PPT1-deficient B cells also had less cell proliferation after CpG stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3H</ref>). Moreover, we found that PPT1 inhibitor HDSF repressed cytokine secretion by TLR9-activated pDCs, B cells and macrophages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3F</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3I</ref>). HDSF-treated B cells also had less cell proliferation after CpG stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S3J</ref>). Since HDSF almost completely abolished IFNα and TNF production, it is a possibility that HDSF-treated pDCs died ex vivo.

TLR9 was found to be present in one of the proteome databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">63</ref> . Therefore, we began to explore the possibility that TLR9 might be palmitoylated. The use of click chemistry can lead to the accurate detection of all sites of palmitoylation, including S-palmitoylation and O-palmitoylation sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">67</ref> .</p><p>Using azido palmitate acid (also called Click-iT palmitic acid, azide) labeling, we showed that murine TLR9 (mTLR9) expressed in the RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line was palmitoylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>). Acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) is another traditional method to specifically detect S-palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">69</ref> . We performed ABE and confirmed that mTLR9 was S-palmitoylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B</ref>). Calnexin, a wellcharacterized S-palmitoylated protein, was used as a positive control, and RAB7 was used as a negative control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S4A</ref>). Both biochemical assays demonstrated that murine TLR9 was palmitoylated.</p><p>Based on a principle similar to that of ABE, we subjected mTLR9 to mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4C</ref>). We found that two cysteine residues, C258 and C265, were S-palmitoylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S4B</ref>). These two amino acids are located in a small loop between the leucine rich repeat 8 (LRR8) and LRR9 in the ectodomain. However, these two palmitoylated sites were not in the Z-loop, the actual ligand-binding groove <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">9</ref> . We then proceeded to substitute these two cysteines with alanines (C258A + C265A, Mut2) and stably expressed this mutant in a TLR9-deficient RAW264.7 macrophage cell line (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S4C-E</ref>). In ABE assays, we found that C258A and C265A mutations reduced the palmitoylation level of mTLR9 by 3-fold (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4E</ref>). Since TLR7 also plays an important role in SLE pathogenesis, we examined the palmitoylation status of TLR7. Using click chemistry and ABE assays, we found that mTLR7 was S-palmitoylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4F,</ref><ref type="figure">G</ref>). In summary, we found that murine TLR9 and TLR7 were S-palmitoylated.</p><p>We next examined the palmitoylation status of human TLR9 (hTLR9). The ABE assays demonstrated that hTLR9 expressed in the human monocyte cell line THP-1 or 293 T cells was also S-palmitoylated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4H,</ref><ref type="figure">I</ref>).

To identify the DHHC proteins involved in mTLR9 palmitoylation, we screened all murine DHHC proteins (23 in total) in 293 T cell lines overexpressing mTLR9 and individual DHHC proteins via ABE assays (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5A</ref>). Among the 23 DHHC proteins we screened, we found that four proteins, DHHC3, DHHC17, DHHC18, and DHHC20, palmitoylated mTLR9 when overexpressed in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5A</ref>). All DHHC proteins carried a cysteine site in the conserved DHHC motif   that was key to enzymatic activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[73]</ref> . Therefore, we replaced the cysteine with serine in these four potential DHHC candidates. Of these mutants, only DHHC3, DHHC17, and DHHC18 showed reduced mTLR9 palmitoylation levels, suggesting that DHHC20 may have been a falsepositive hit (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5B</ref>). Since mutated DHHC3 led to the most deleterious phenotype, we knocked out DHHC3 in RAW264.7 cells and found that the mTLR9 palmitoylation rate was reduced in DHHC3-deficient cell lines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5E</ref>). DHHC3, DHHC17 and DHHC18 had been previously found to be located in the Golgi and ubiquitously expressed in pDCs and macrophages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5A</ref>, B) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[74]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[77]</ref> .

Based on mTLR9 results, we also screened four human DHHC proteins with ABE assays in 293 T cells expressing hTLR9. Only DHHC3 and DHHC17 could palmitoylate hTLR9s in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5E</ref>). Human DHHC3 and DHHC17 were also located in the Golgi, and expressed in human pDCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S5C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>).

We noticed that the cellular palmitoylation profile was markedly changed in bone marrow-derived pDCs (Flt3L-pDCs) and RAW264.7 cells that were stimulated with a TLR9 agonist CpG A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6A</ref>). Using a variety of TLR agonists, we found that only the TLR9 agonists CpG A and CpG B reduced the mTLR9 palmitoylation levels in RAW264.7 cells, as shown by ABE assays (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6B</ref>). TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 or TLR7 agonists failed to alter mTLR9 palmitoylation (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6B</ref>). In contrast, TLR7 was not depalmitoylated after R848 stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6B</ref>). In this experiment, we showed that only TLR9 S-palmitoylation, but not TLR7, was reduced after activation.</p><p>Next, we sought to identify enzymes that depalmitoylate TLR9. Hydrolases, such as acyl protein thioesterases (APTs) in the cytosol, alpha/beta-hydrolase domain (ABHD) proteins and palmitoyl-protein thioesterases (PPTs) in lysosomes, can depalmitoylate proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">78,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">79</ref> . Since TLR9 is trafficked from the Golgi to endosomes without being exposed its ectodomain to the cytosol, we considered only endosomal enzymes such as ABHD and PPT family members. Among the ABHD family members, ABHD10, ABHD17a, ABHD17b and ABHD17c had been previously shown to exhibit depalmitoylation ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">81</ref> . Of these candidates, only ABHD17a and ABHD17b were highly enriched in pDCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6C</ref>). In the PPT family, PPT1 has been shown to be a potent depalmitoylating enzyme in mice and humans, while PPT2 has been shown to exhibit specific affinity for palmitoyl-CoA but not proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">82</ref> . Therefore, we analyzed palmitoylation levels of mTLR9 co-expressed with ABHD17a, ABHD17b or PPT1 in 293 T cells via ABE assay. We found that only PPT1 depalmitoylated mTLR9 in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6C</ref>). In comparison, PPT1 could not depalmitoylate mTLR7 at all (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6D</ref>).</p><p>Through an ABE assay using Flt3L-pDCs from PPT1-deficient mice, we confirmed that the loss of PPT1 resulted in increased TLR9 palmitoylation in CpG A-activated Fl3tL-pDCs at 4 h and 24 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6E</ref>). Depalmitoylation of TLR9 after CpG A or CpG B activation was not evident in PPT1-deficient macrophages, suggesting that PPT1 played a role in depalmitoylation of TLR9 (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6F</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6D, E</ref>). Treatment with a general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP or a PPT1-specific inhibitor HDSF decreased or increased mTLR9 palmitoylation, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6F</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">83</ref> . We found that chemical inhibition of PPT1 was sufficient to abolish TLR9 depalmitoylation after CpG A and CpG B activation (Figs. 6G and S6G) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">59</ref> . Accordingly, 2-BP could decrease mTLR7 palmitoylation, while HDSF could not increase mTLR7 palmitoylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S6H</ref>). Collectively, our data suggested that PPT1, a lysosomal depalmitoylating enzyme, could depalmitoylate TLR9 upon CpG activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Palmitoylation regulates TLR9 trafficking and depalmitoylation regulates TLR9 release</head><p>Since TLR9 undergoes a cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation, we sought to examine the impact of this cycle on TLR9 function.</p><p>Through intracellular cytokine staining, we found that the loss of two palmitoylation sites (C258A and C265A) in mTLR9 led to reduced TNF production upon CpG B stimulations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7A</ref>). Using biotinylated CpG B in an immunoprecipitation assay, we found that these two mutations reduced the amount of cleaved mTLR9 bound to a labeled CpG ligand (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7B</ref>). Our data suggested that S-palmitoylation might regulate TLR9's binding to CpG.</p><p>Next, we examined the impact of DHHC3 and PPT1, the two key enzymes involved in the palmitoylation cycle, on mTLR9 ligand binding capability. Through ELISAs, we found that DHHC3-deficient RAW264.7 cells secreted a reduced level of TNF (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7C</ref>). Similarly, we found a reduction in TLR9-bound ligand level in DHHC3-deficient RAW264.7 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7D</ref>). PPT1-deficient RAW264.7 cells also produced less TNF when stimulated with CpG B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7E</ref>). Correspondingly, the ligand binding rate was reduced in PPT1-deficient cell lines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7F</ref>). Disruption of the palmitoylation cycle by adding either 2-BP or HDSF reduced TNF production and the ligand-binding rates of TLR9 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7G,</ref><ref type="figure">H</ref>). Interestingly, less cleaved TLR9 was observed in mTLR9 Mut2 cells before the pulldown, whereas there was no such phenomenon in DHHC3 or PPT1-deficent cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S7A</ref>). Our results showed that the Golgi-to-lysosome palmitoylation cycle regulated TLR9 ligand binding. Next, we sought to differentiate the distinct function of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation. Regarding palmitoylation, we performed cell fractionation experiments, and found that more full length (FL) mTLR9 was retained in the Golgi fractions of DHHC3-deficient cells, which suggested that palmitoylation mediated by DHHC3 supported mTLR9 traffic into early endosomes where mTLR9 is cleaved to generate its functional form (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7I</ref>). However, mTLR9 Mut2 had no obvious trafficking defect (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S7B</ref>). Regarding depalmitoylation in lysosomes, we performed Co-IP experiments to detect the release of mTLR9 from UNC93B1 in lysosomes, which is essential for TLR9 signal initiation. We found that HDSF reduced the amount of UNC93B1 release from mTLR9 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7J</ref>). Our results suggest that palmitoylation regulated the trafficking of mTLR9 from the Golgi to endosomes; while depalmitoylation regulated the release of TLR9 from UNC93B1 in endolysosomes.</p><p>Lastly, general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP lowered IFNα secretion by PBMCs from SLE patients (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S7C</ref>). 2-BP also reduced IL-6 production by B cells and their proliferation in vitro (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S7D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>). However, 2-BP did not reduce the levels of anti-DNA antibodies or total IgG in B6.Sle1yaa mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S7F,</ref><ref type="figure">G</ref>). Therefore, we conclude that 2-BP regulated cytokine expression and immune cell proliferation in vitro.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we showed that TLR9 is palmitoylated in human and mice. Furthermore, we found that the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation of TLR9 were mediated by Golgi-resident DHHC3 and lysosomal-resident PPT1, respectively. This palmitoylation cycle regulated cytokine production in pDCs, B cells, and macrophages. We also demonstrated the significance of the TLR9 palmitoylation cycle in a murine model of SLE in vivo.</p><p>Our results suggested that the ligand binding of TLR9 is regulated by the endosomal palmitoylation cycle. We utilized several biochemical methods, such as click chemistry, ABE assay, and mass spectrometry, to show that human and mouse TLR9 are S-palmitoylated. Click chemistry and ABE assays can only predict the general palmitoylation status of a protein. We found that TLR9 is palmitoylated at the miniloop between LRRs. This pattern suggests that the palmitoylated amino acids may directly or indirectly facilitate the binding of CpG ligands. However, none of the potential palmitoylated sites were located in the CpG binding Z-loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">84</ref> . Palmitoylation has been shown to be important for endosomal trafficking of membrane associated proteins, such as Rab GTPases <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">85</ref> . Besides ligand binding and receptor trafficking, changes in palmitoylation level of TLR9 downstream signaling adapters, such as MYD88, might contribute to our observed phenotypes, especially in experiments using palmitoylation inhibitors <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">54</ref> . Lastly, previous studies of palmitoylated proteins have consistently identified only one or two cysteine residues as S-palmitoylation sites. However, our two point mutations (Mut2) did not completely abolish TLR9 palmitoylation in ABE assays. This suggested that TLR9 may have additional palmitoylation sites. In summary, S-palmitoylation may simultaneously regulate TLR9 and TLR7 trafficking, membrane stability, and downstream signaling pathway.</p><p>Regarding the TLR9 Mut2, we have consistently noticed the weaker cleaved TLR9 bands in TLR9-Mut2 cells. However, we did not see such clearly weakened cleavage bands in our DHHC3 or PPT1-deficient cells. We also performed cellular fractionation experiments on Mut2 cells, and they had no defect in trafficking of TLR9 from Golgi to endosomes. This indicated that this Mut2 phenotype is not entirely due to the loss of palmitoylation. One possible explanation could be that these two mutations play a role in TLR9 cleavage process itself. Multiple lysosomal proteases are required for TLR9 cleavage. These two mutations may result in an altered structure, or may interfere with enzymatic process. Given that TLR9 is a highly conserved protein, these two sites may have additional functions beyond palmitoylation.</p><p>Despite our identification of DHHC3 and PPT1 as main enzymes in the endosomal palmitoylation cycle, other acyltransferases or thioesterases may be capable of palmitoylating or depalmitoylating TLR9. For example, we showed that Golgi-based DHHC17 and DHHC18 possessed the potential to palmitoylate TLR9 in vitro. To overcome the limitation of in vitro assays, experiments with mice deficient in different DHHCs may be useful for determining the function and redundancy of these enzymes in vivo. Compared to DHHC screening, only 5 lysosomal enzymes are known to depalmitoylate proteins. We screened PPT1, ABHD17a, and ABHD17b based on their high expression in pDCs, but not ABHD17c or ABHD10. Because our depalmitoylation enzyme screening was limited, we could possibly miss other proteins besides PPT1 that has a similar capacity for depalmitoylating TLR9. Additionally, it is not clear why the endosomal palmitoylation cycle must occur in the Golgi and lysosomes. The co-localization of TLR9 with DHHC3, PPT1, and other potential interacting proteins, warrants further investigation via cellular fractionation or super resolution microscopy in pDCs and macrophages. It is unclear whether specific organelles provide favorable conditions for palmitoylation depalmitoylation of TLR9. It would be interesting to investigate which molecules signal the key lysosomal depalmitoylation step after TLR9 activation. Lastly, we have yet to confirm the human homolog of DHHC3 and PPT1 in the hTLR9 palmitoylation cycle. The endosomal locations of murine and human DHHCs are highly conserved, as indicated by human DHHC3, DHHC17, and DHHC18 being located in the Golgi. The effect of the palmitoylation inhibitor treatment of human samples support the hypothesis that the murine and human TLR9 palmitoylation mechanisms might be similar.</p><p>Our results suggest that the TLR9 palmitoylation cycle has two major steps: palmitoylation in the Golgi, and depalmitoylation in endosomes. By performing cellular fractionation experiments, we found that DHHC3-deficient cells retained more full-length TLR9 in the Golgi, and less cleaved TLR9 was found in endosomes. Thus, palmitoylation is required for the trafficking of TLR9 from the Golgi to endosomes. Less cleaved TLR9 in the endosomes would result in a decrease of TNF secretion that was observed in DHHC3-deficient cells. Regarding the depalmitoylation step, using Co-IP experiment to probe the amount of retained TLR9 on UNC93B1, we found that there was less TLR9 bound to UNC93B1 in HDSF-treated cells, which also led to reduced TLR9 signaling. In summary, TLR9 palmitoylation regulates TLR9 trafficking from the Golgi to endosomes, and TLR9 depalmitoylation controls the release of TLR9 from UNC93B1 in endosomes. Inhibition of either step would result in less free cleaved TLR9 in the endosomes and thus reduced signaling. In accordance, HDSFtreatment and PPT1-deficiency both markedly slowed SLE pathogenesis. However, 2-BP treatment had little effect on autoantibody production in vivo. Further studies with DHHC3-deficient mice should further clarify the importance of TLR7/9 palmitoylation.</p><p>TLR7 has been shown to be an important signaling pathway for SLE pathogenesis. Using click chemistry and ABE assays, we found that TLR7 was also S-palmitoylated. However, DHHC3 overexpression could not palmitoylate TLR7, suggesting that other DHHCs might be responsible for TLR7 palmitoylation. More importantly, ABE assays showed that TLR7 was not depalmitoylated after R848 activation. In contrast, TLR9 was quickly depalmitoylated after CpG activation and stayed depalmitoylated even after 24 h. Moreover, overexpression of PPT1 do not cause TLR7 to depalmitoylate. Neither could PPT1 inhibitor HDSF change TLR7 palmitoylation level. In conclusion, TLR7 is not involved in the same cycle of palmitoylation/depalmitoylation as TLR9. Cleaved TLR7 does not need to be released from UNC93B1, while TLR9 does. The depalmitoylation of TLR9 by PPT1 facilitated its release from UNC93B1 before ligand-binding in lysosomes, while the TLR7 may not require depalmitoylation to initiate downstream signaling. Thus, it is less likely that the phenotypes we observed in the PPT1deficient mice are mainly due to perturbed depalmitoylation of TLR7.</p><p>B cells, which are also activated by TLR7 and TLR9, arguably play a direct role in SLE pathogenesis. Although PPT1 expression in B cells was lower than pDCs and macrophages, the impact of the palmitoylation cycles on B cells should not be overlooked. Regarding the palmitoylation step, we found that 2-BP decreased IL-6 production and cell proliferation in B cells in vitro. Unfortunately, 2-BP treatment had little effect on autoantibody production in vivo. Regarding the depalmitoylaton step, we sorted B cells from Ppt1 +/+ or Ppt1 -/-mice and examined their IL-6 production with ELISA. We found that PPT1 had an impact on IL-6 production by B cells, though the difference was very modest. Next, we examined Ppt1 +/+ or Ppt1 -/-B cell proliferation after TLR9 stimulation. We also found that there was a slight difference. PPT1 inhibitor HSDF had a stronger effect on B cell cytokine secretion and proliferation. This pattern is consistent as in pDCs and macrophages. In conclusion, the TLR9 palmitoylation cycle had a modest impact in B cells, and may contribute partially to the phenotypes we observed in PPT1-deficient mice. Since TLR9 may be both inflammatory and suppressive in B cells, our results suggest that TLR9 palmitoylation may play a pathogenic role in B cells. It would also be intriguing to compare the differences in PPT1 expression levels in macrophages and pDCs from healthy volunteers and SLE patients, as well as changes in response to CpG A stimulation, and to detect differences and changes in TLR9 palmitoylation modification and inflammatory factor secretion.</p><p>Our previously published results regarding PPT1 in cDC1s complicates our current finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . We reported that PPT1-deficient cDC1s enhanced the priming of naive CD8 + T cells into tissue-resident effectors and memory T cells, resulting in rapid clearance of tumors and Listeria monocytogenes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . Mechanistically, we showed that PPT1 protected steady-state DCs from viral infection by promoting antigen degradation and endosomal acidification via V-ATPase recruitment <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">79</ref> . We also previously demonstrated that PPT1-deficient cDCs and MoDCs exhibit upregulated cytokine production and costimulatory molecules when activated with the TLR4 agonist LPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . In the present study, we demonstrated that PPT1-deficient pDCs and macrophages under TLR9 stimulation are less activated, leading to the acquisition of a phenotype that is opposite of hyperactivated PPT1-deficient cDC1s. In PPT1-deficient mice, hyperactivated cDC1s and hypoactivated pDCs coexist, complicating the study of the overall inflammatory phenotype. In tumors and intracellular bacterial and chronic viral infection, PPT1 deficiency in cDC1s enhances the cross-presentation-specific CTL response. In SLE, PPT1 deficiency in pDCs weakens the overall T cell responses.</p><p>Originally used to treat malaria, the chloroquine derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective medication to treat SLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">86</ref> . HCQ accumulates in endosomes and prevents endosomal TLRs from binding to their ligands <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">88</ref> . One of the possible inhibitory targets of HCQ is palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">89</ref> . HDSF may also exert effects by mediating the activation of the same immunosuppressive pathway as that mediated by HCQ, which also inhibits PPT1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">89</ref> . HSDF action may also inhibit MYD88 and STAT3 activation, as both proteins are palmitoylated <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">55</ref> . In addition, it is possible that HDSF could increase endosomal pH, which may reduce the TLR9 cleavage rate dependent on acidic lysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">79</ref> . Our results indicated a more robust inhibition of the TLR9 pathway than TLR7, which is consistent with previous findings with HCQ <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">90</ref> . This further supports the notion that the most commonly used SLE therapeutic is the correct agent for inhibiting TLR9 signaling.</p><p>PPT1 may be a great drug target to treat IFN-I-mediated autoimmunity, because its inhibition may simultaneously enhance cDC1dependent cross-priming and suppress pDC-dependent IFN-I production. Many immunosuppressive drugs have the same drawback: they have been associated with frequent opportunistic infections and tumorigenesis due to weakened immunity in patients. In this study, we demonstrated that PPT1 inhibitor HDSF effectively controls IFN-I production in mice and humans. We previously showed that PPT1-deficient mice had a lower tumor burden and a higher survival rate than PPT1-sufficient mice in xenograft tumor models, possibly due to 4-fold expansion of tissue-resident memory CD8 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . PPT1-deficient mice also had 30-fold lower bacterial load when infected with Listeria monocytogenes, an intracellular bacterium, due to 3-fold expansion of KLRG-1 + short-lived effector CD8 + T cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . In addition, PPT1-deficient mice had 3-fold lower viral titers when infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13, a chronic infection variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . Similarly, adoptive transfer of WT BMDCs treated with HDSF was able to extend mice survival in xenograft tumor transplantation models and lower bacterial load by 50-fold in Listeria monocytogenes infection models <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">57</ref> . PPT1 inhibitors such as HDSF may be the first drug in its class to suppress autoimmunity while enhancing immunity against tumorigenesis and infection.</p><p>In conclusion, our data reveal a Golgi-to-lysosomal palmitoylation pathway that regulates the TLR9 and TLR7 response in mice and humans. We showed that disruption of this endosomal palmitoylation/ depalmitoylation cycle suppressed TLR9 ligand binding and cytokine production in pDCs and macrophages. PPT1 genetic deficiency or chemical inhibition suppressed anti-DNA autoantibodies and attenuated nephritis in B6.Sle1yaa mice. Given its opposite action in cDC1s and pDCs, PPT1 may be a potential pharmaceutical inhibitory target for SLE treatment, due to possible added benefit of enhancing the CTL response against cancer and pathogens.</p></div>

Flag (DYKDDDDK) or hemagglutinin (YPYDVPDYA) was fused to the C-terminus of the indicated target genes, and then, all the genes were cloned into the lentivirus package vector pWPI (Addgene, 12254).</p><p>To generate RAW264.7 Ppt1 -/-, RAW264.7 Tlr9 -/-and RAW264.7 Zdhhc3 -/-cells, sgRNA-targeted lentiCRISPR v2 was transduced into RAW264.7 cells. Puromycin (2 µg/mL) was added to the cells 24 h posttransduction and maintained for 2 weeks. On Day 14, individual cells were seeded in a 96-well plate, and cells were monitored for growth before genomic DNA extraction and analysis. Gene disruption was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of target proteins or by functional analysis. The guide RNA sequences (Ppt1: GCTGGTGATCTGG-CATGGGA;</p><p>Tlr9: GCTGAAGCCTCATGGCCTGG; Zdhhc3: GCCATGTGGTTTATCCGAGA) were designed and synthesized after codon optimization by the Tsingke Biotechnology Synthesis Service and subcloned into a lentiCRISPR v2 plasmid (Addgene, 52961).</p></div>
