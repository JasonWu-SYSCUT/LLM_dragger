<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Clathrin/dynamin-independent endocytosis of ordered plasma membrane domains (ordered membrane domain endocytosis, OMDE) can become massive in response to cytoplasmic Ca elevations, G protein activation by non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs, and enhanced oxidative metabolism. In patch-clamped murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), cytoplasmic succinate and pyruvate, but not β-hydroxybutyrate, induce OMDE of 75% of the plasma membrane within 2 min. The responses require palmitoylation of membrane proteins, being decreased by 70% in BMMs lacking the acyltransferase, DHHC5, by treatment with carnitine to shift long-chain acyl groups from cytoplasmic to mitochondrial acyl-CoAs, by bromopalmitate/albumin complexes to block DHHCs, and by the mitochondria-specific cyclosporin, NIM811, to block permeability transition pores that may release mitochondrial coenzyme A into the cytoplasm. Using T-REx293 cells, OMDE amounts to 40% with succinate, pyruvate, or GTPγS, and it is inhibited by actin cytoskeleton disruption. Pyruvate-induced OMDE is blocked by the hydrophobic antioxidant, edaravone, which prevents permeability transition pore openings. Using fluorescent 3kD dextrans to monitor endocytosis, OMDE appears to be constitutively active in T-REx293 cells but not in BMMs. After 1 h without substrates or bicarbonate, pyruvate and hydroxybutyrate inhibit constitutive OMDE, as expected for a shift of CoA from long-chain acyl-CoAs to other CoA metabolites. In the presence of bicarbonate, pyruvate strongly enhances OMDE, which is then blocked by β-hydroxybutyrate, bromopalmitate/albumin complexes, cyclosporines, or edaravone. After pyruvate responses, T-REx293 cells grow normally with no evidence for apoptosis. Fatty acid-free albumin (15 μM) inhibits basal OMDE in T-REx293 cells, as do cyclosporines, carnitine, and RhoA blockade. Surprisingly, OMDE in the absence of substrates and bicarbonate is not inhibited by siRNA knockdown of the acyltransferases, DHHC5 or DHHC2, which are required for activated OMDE in patch clamp experiments. We verify biochemically that small CoA metabolites decrease longchain acyl-CoAs. We verify also that palmitoylations of many PM-associated proteins decrease and increase when OMDE is inhibited and stimulated, respectively, by different metabolites. STED microscopy reveals that vesicles formed during constitutive OMDE in T-REX293 cells have 90 to 130 nm diameters. In summary, OMDE is likely a major G-protein-dependent endocytic mechanism that can be constitutively active in some cell types, albeit not BMMs. OMDE depends on different DHHC acyltransferases in different circumstances and can be limited by local supplies of fatty acids, CoA, and long-chain acyl-CoAs.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction.</head><p>Eukaryotic cells use endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref> to carry out a wide range of cellular functions. Phagocytosis and macropinocytosis are used to internalize large particles and fluid volumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>. Micro-pinocytotic mechanisms generate vesicles from the plasma membrane (PM) with diameters of 40 to 200 nm (4), thereby internalizing integral PM proteins, PM-associated proteins, and various other types of particles, as well as fluid <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. In doing so, micro-pinocytotic mechanisms re-localize membrane and membrane proteins from the cell surface into internal membrane systems from which membrane and protein can be recycled, degraded, and/or used for cell signaling functions. Innumerable studies show that micro-pinocytosis can occur by diverse mechanisms, ranging from the coordinated function of clathrin, dynamins, and other adapter proteins to the lateral reorganization of plasma membrane lipids and proteins into domains, often with additional involvement of actin cytoskeleton to direct budding and vesiculation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Dynamins can drive some forms of endocytosis without clathrin <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. However, one such example has recently been questioned. In contrast to a long-time assumption of the field, it was recently described that dynamin-2 may not support the internalization of caveolae, but rather restrain caveolae internalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. Another instructive example concerns turnover of PM in two cell types used routinely in cell biological studies. For HeLa cells, it has been proposed that nearly all PM turnover under standard cell culture conditions occurs via clathrin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. In mouse fibroblasts, by contrast, the deletion of all three dynamins results in no clear change of fluid phase endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>, and we verify this in Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S1</ref>. Importantly, analysis of fluid phase dextran uptake by confocal optical methods can readily detect clathrin/dynamin endocytosis (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>). Thus, it remains enigmatic whether (i) different endocytic mechanisms operate differently in these different cell types, (ii) different endocytic mechanisms compensate one another when one is manipulated by genetic means, or whether (iii) clathrin/dynamin endocytosis is only a small fraction of total PM turnover in fibroblasts.</p><p>Using patch clamp to monitor PM area changes and to manipulate the contents of the cytoplasm, we have been impressed by the large magnitudes and speeds with which endocytic responses can occur via clathrin/dynamin-independent mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. We have documented in multiple cell types the occurrence of massive endocytosis that internalizes more than 50% of the PM into relatively small vesicles (i.e. less than 240 nm) within one to two minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. We have described these responses in primarily three circumstances-in the wake of large cytoplasmic Ca elevations, during activation of G-proteins by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs, and with activation of oxidative metabolism in mitochondria by substrates such as succinate. In all cases, we have verified that the membrane that internalizes binds amphipathic compounds less well than membrane that remains at the cell surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. Given that more ordered membrane domains internalize, we suggest that this form of endocytosis may productively be called ordered membrane domain endocytosis (OMDE). Potentially, this term can be used in the future to include the various forms of endocytosis otherwise dubbed 'raft' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>, 'CLIC' <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> and 'bulk' <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> endocytosis. All of these endocytic mechanisms are dynamin/clathrinindependent and may have dependence on actin cytoskeleton in addition to membrane lipid and protein ordering.</p><p>While patch clamp results suggest that OMDE can be remarkably powerful when activated, available data does not establish that OMDE is active constitutively in cells or under standard cell culture conditions. Rather, work to date indicates that OMDE becomes active when cellular conditions promote palmitoylation of membrane proteins that subsequently can coalesce into ordered domains.</p><p>As already noted, mitochondrial oxidative stress appears to promote this process, and our working hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms are outlined in cartoon form in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1</ref>. In brief, mitochondria accumulate the ubiquitous enzymatic cofactor, coenzyme A (CoA), to high concentrations with respect to the cytoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. As mitochondria generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to enhanced cytochrome oxidase activities and Ca accumulation, transient openings of permeability transition pores (PTPs) allow CoA to escape to the cytoplasm, promoting generation of long-chain acyl-CoAs. In dependence on acyl-CoA accumulation, as well as other signaling mechanisms that are only partially elucidated, key PM proteins are evidently rapidly palmitoylated to promote OMDE.</p><p>To address how and when this occurs in cultured cells without patch clamp, we describe here studies of fluid phase endocytosis of small fluorescent dextrans (3-10 kD) in which we have tested acute effects of factors that promote or hinder OMDE in patch clamp experiments. Further to this end, we compare the function of endocytosis in two very different cell types, T-REx293 cells and differentiated murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). To develop clear perspectives on OMDE, we describe first via patch clamp that OMDE activated by oxidative metabolism in BMMs is more powerful than in other cells, internalizing 75% of the PM in 2 min and requiring expression of the acyltransferase, DHHC5. While less powerful, we show that OMDE activated by GTPγS in T-REx293 cells is highly dependent on actin cytoskeleton when membrane tension is high, but not when membrane tension is relieved. Then, analyzing fluid phase endocytosis of dextrans unperturbed cell cultures, we show that constitutive (basal) endocytosis in T-REx293 cells is significantly activated by palmitate/albumin complexes and reduced by inhibitors of palmitoylation, as well as by RhoA G-protein inhibition and cyclosporines that inhibit mitochondrial PTPs. We go on to show that constitutive endocytosis in T-REx293 cells can be strongly activated by extracellular pyruvate in the presence of bicarbonate.</p><p>OMDE is inhibited by low concentrations of fatty acid-free albumin (15 μM) and can be restored by albumin/palmitate complexes. While pyruvate is stimulatory, some mitochondrial substrates are inhibitory. Finally, we show via STED microscopy that vesicles formed in OMDE are 90 to 120 nm in diameter. All results for T-REx293 cells, but not for BMMs, are consistent with mitochondriadependent OMDE constituting a large fraction of basal PM turnover. However, the constitutive OMDE activity appears to use DHHC acyltransferases besides DHHC5 and DHHC2. We conclude that constitutive (basal) PM turnover in these different cell types occurs by different mechanisms and that OMDE in BMMs must be activated by cell signaling mechanisms that are not constitutively active.</p></div>

The DHHC5 gene-trapped mice were from the same line used previously in which expression of DHHC5 in all tissues tested was reduced by &gt;80% <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>. Equal numbers of male and female mice were employed in experiments with no significant differences in results.</p><p>Primary Cells, Cell Culture and Transfection. Isolation of Lung Fibroblasts. Lung fibroblasts of DHHC5-GT animals and their WT controls were isolated as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. In brief, animals were euthanized, sterilized with ethanol, and transferred to the laminar flow. Lungs were excised, cut in 1mmx1mm pieces, and placed in a grated Petri-dish. 10 mL of high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50U/mL Penicillin/ and 50µg/mL streptomycin were added carefully, and dishes were placed in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. After 7-10 days, tissue pieces were removed, and outgrown cells were subjected to experiments after they reached 90% confluency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isolation and Differentiation of Bone Marrow Macrophages. Bone marrow cells of DHHC5-GT</head><p>animals and their controls were isolated as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. In brief, animals were euthanized, sterilized with ethanol, and transferred to the laminar flow. Hind limbs were removed, and the femur and tibia were cleaned rigorously. Bone marrow was flushed out of the bones with 1x PBS and was collected in conical tubes on ice. After resuspension of bone marrow pieces, cells were filtered through a 75 µm cell strainer and the filtered suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 500xg. The cell number was then determined using a hematocytometer. Cells were seeded at a density of 1x10 6 /six-well well in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50U/mL penicillin/ and 50µg/mL streptomycin and 25 ng/mL M-CSF (PreproTech, Cranbury, NJ). Cells were employed in experiments after 7 days. For patch clamp experiments, cells were trypsinized and employed without reattaching to dishes.</p><p>Isolation of Peritoneal Macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages of DHHC5-GT mice and their WT controls were isolated as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. In brief, animals were euthanized, sterilized with ethanol and the skin layer was carefully removed from the abdomen. The inner skin lining of the peritoneal cavity was then carefully punctured and 5 mL of PBS supplemented with 3% FBS were injected. The peritoneal cavity was massaged for about 30 s, the isolation medium was reaspirated, and cells were transferred to 50mL of solution in a conical tube. The tube was centrifuged for 5 min at 500xg. Cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and thereafter employed in electrophysiological measurements.</p><p>Cell Culture and Transfection. T-REx 293 cells were grown in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 U/mL penicillin/ and 50µg/mL streptomycin in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Transfection of T-REx293 cells with siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNAs targeting DHHC 2 and 5 were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) and cells were subjected to experiments 48 h after transfection.</p><p>Generation of DHHC5/2 knock-out cells. CRISPR knock-out cell lines were produced using established methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. The T-REx293 cell line was transiently transfected with LentiCRISPRv2 (Addgene, #52961). The sgRNA sequences used for cloning LentiCRISPRv2-DHHC5 were: DHHC5-forward primer, CCGTGAATAACTGTATTGGTCGC and DHHC5-reverse primer, AAACGCGACCAATACA GTTATTCAC. The sgRNA sequences used for cloning LentiCRISPRv2-DHHC2 were: DHHC2-forward primer, CACCGCGTAGTAGGACCAGCCGAGC and DHHC2-reverse primer, AAACGCTCGGCTGGTCCTACTACGC. The sequencing primer of LentiCRISPRv2 was hU6F: GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATT, which was used to verify the sgRNA/Cas9-mediated DHHC2 or DHHC5 gene knockout clones. After the appropriate plasmids were transfected, cells were cultured with medium containing puromycin (10 µg/ml) for one week to select for the surviving cells with the desired plasmids for knockdown of the two genes. For dual knockdown of DHHC2 and DHHC5, cells were co-transfected with LentiCRISPRv2-DHHC5 and LentiCRISPRv2-DHHC2, followed by the relevant selection procedures.</p><p>Patch clamp, and capacitance measurement. Axopatch 1C patch clamp amplifiers were employed using our own software for capacitance and conductance recording via square-wave voltage perturbation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Unless stated otherwise, solution compositions were the same as employed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. All patch clamp experiments were performed at 0 mV and 35°C.</p><p>Extracellular solution changes were performed by abruptly moving the microscope stage so as to place the patch-clamped cell directly in front of 1 of 4 square pipettes (1 mm) with solution steams maintained by gravity at velocities of 2 to 5 cm/s. In all experiments in which two or more protocols were compared using a single batch of cells, protocols were performed in a randomized fashion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>STED microscopy. STED microscopy was performed in the UTSouthwestern O'Donnell Brain</head><p>Institute NeuroMicroscopy Core Facility using an Abberior Instruments STED microscope. The Abberior Facility Line system is a 3-D STED super-resolution imaging system. Super-resolution images were acquired from fixed samples, prepared as described. 30 to 40 nm isotropic resolution was verified in our samples. Adaptive Illumination (RESCue, DyMIN and MINFIELD) was employed with a 60X (NA1.42 WD 0.15mm) Oil Objective. Pulsed 485 nm, 561 nm, and 640 nm lasers were employed. 595 nm and 775 nm STED depletion lasers were employed.</p><p>Immunoblotting. For protein isolations cells were washed 3x with pre-cooled PBS and homogenized in pre-cooled RIPA buffer (containing in mM: 150 NaCl, 50 Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 5 EDTA, 1 EGTA; Triton X-100 1% [vol/vol], deoxycholate 0.5% [wt/vol], SDS 0.1% [wt/vol], and protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche) and lysed for 30 minutes at 4°C. Lysates were cleared at 20,000xg for 15 minutes and subjected to SDS PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. Antisera: Anti-ZDHHC5 antibody, produced in rabbit, HPA014670, was from Sigma. Anti-ZDHHC2 antibody, produced in mouse, Clone 1035A <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, was a gift of Dr. Masaki Fukata, Okazaki. Since the DHHC2 antibody provided by Dr. Fukata is no longer available, nor is a comparable antibody available, we subsequently evaluated knockdown of DHHC5 and DHHC2 by qPCR, as described below. Anti-actin was purchased from Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX).</p><p>RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR. RNA isolation and Real-Time PCR were performed as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. In brief, total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kits according to manufacturer`s instructions and 1 µg of RNA was reverse transcribed employing the High-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>.</p><p>Analysis of dextran uptake assays. All bar graphs depicting dextran uptake correspond to the analysis of 12 or more fields of view from at least two dishes of cells fixed as described. Typically 4 images were taken from each of the dishes to be compared, and the procedure was repeated 3 times in the same sequence. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref> illustrates our routine analysis of the dextran uptake assays using a relatively complex sample in which cell density reached confluence in some regions and was sparse in others. Figs.2A to 1C show the fluorescent dextran and Hoechst dye images of a field of T-REx293 cells (~150 cells) that was treated and fixed as described above. Using ImageJ software, a threshold fluorescence was set high enough to eliminate background fluorescence in cells fixed without dextran (not shown). Particles were then identified and outlined, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2C</ref> using an upper limit set to 2 square microns. Particles were counted in this without setting a lower particle size limit, the influence of which is described subsequently. The number of nuclei was determined as described in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">1D</ref>. As apparent in the Hoechst image in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2C</ref>, nuclei often overlapped in regions where the cell culture was nearly confluent. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2C</ref>, the ImageJ software was then unable to accurately separate nucleus images, so that automated nucleus counting became impossible. Therefore, we used two other strategies to determine the number of nuclei. In some cases, we counted nuclei manually by marking them individually via ImageJ. Second, we determined the total nuclear area, as defined by nuclei outlines, as in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2D</ref>. We then divided the total area by the average nucleus area determined from 20 to 40 individual nucleus area measurements. As indicated below Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2D</ref>, the two approaches yielded values that did not differ by more than 5 to 6%, 153 versus 144 nuclei in this case.</p><p>Figures 2E to 2G illustrate the analysis of dextran uptake using different criteria. The data shown are from the experiment described subsequently in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8B</ref>, demonstrating that dextran uptake is markedly inhibited by fatty acid free albumin (15 μM) but not by 2:1 palmitate/albumin complexes at the same concentration. Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2E</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2F</ref> show results quantified as particles per cell for the three conditions, both without setting a lower particle size threshold and with a lower particle size limit set to 0.25 square microns (i.e. a diameter of 500 nm). In the latter case, the number of apparent particles is 5-times less and the apparent dextran uptake is reduced by only 40% versus 60%. Based on our subsequent analysis using STED microscopy, we concluded empirically that the former analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2E</ref>), which generates higher particle numbers, is in fact more accurate. This can be justified by the fact that the thresholding procedure employed results distorts the dimensions of small particles so as to be smaller than the wavelength of light. Finally, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2G</ref> shows the same experimental results quantified as total particle area per total nuclear area, instead of particles per cell. The results are quantitatively very similar to results for particle numbers, indicating simply that average particle size does not change with FA-free albumin treatment. We considered and tested several statistical methods to analyze acyl-RAC results using mass spectrometry to quantify proteins. Results presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref> are all from triplicate cell samples prepared in parallel under identical conditions. Given that mass spectrometry results can be relatively variable from sample to sample, we employed the median value from the three measurements in subsequent calculations. From these measurements as well as quantification of Western blots in parallel, we found that caveolin-1 was consistently highly enriched in samples and was never observed to change significantly with treatments carried out. This outcome was not unexpected, given that caveolins are palmitoylated at minimally three cysteines <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> and that palmitoylation at a single cysteine results in pull-down in the acyl-RAC procedure employed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chemicals</head><p>Therefore, we normalized protein in each set of measurements to the amount of caveolin-1 present in the sample. Results were qualitatively very similar, but more prone to variability, when quantified from the absolute protein counts.</p></div>

DHHC5/2-dependent OMDE: Activation by GTPγS and oxidative metabolism in patch clamped</head><p>T-REx293 cells and BMMs. quickly into a solution stream that was warmed to 35°C. Without discernable changes of cell conductance, membrane capacitance ( i.e. PM area) decreases by about 40% over 8 min. As described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, this occurs more than 5-fold faster, and can be enhanced, when T-REx293 cells overexpress the cardiac NCX1 Na/Ca exchanger, which is palmitoylated at one cysteine close to the PM <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3B</ref> illustrates additional key features of OMDE activated by GTPγS that were not described previously. From left to right, the responses in cells without NCX1 expression amounted on average to a 40% loss of PM over 8 min. Using T-TEx293 cells in which two DHHCs known to reach the PM, DHHC5 and DHHC2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, are knocked out by CSPR (see Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S2</ref>), the PM loss is decreased to 18%. Cytoplasmic carnitine is a substrate of carnitine palmitoyl transferase, which converts long-chain acyl-CoAs to acyl-carnitines that are transported into mitochondria and resynthesized to acyl-CoAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. The endocytic response is decreased to less than 5% when 5 mM carnitine is included in the pipette solution, presumably by depleting the cytoplasmic pool of longchain acyl-CoAs. This result supports our suggestion that long-chain acyl-CoAs can limiting for the endocytic responses under the conditions of these experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. When actin cytoskeleton is disrupted by treating cells for 10 min with latrunculin (0.5 μM), and including latrunculin (2 μM) in the pipette, the PM loss is blocked and replaced by a PM expansion response of about 25%.</p><p>Nevertheless, the loss of PM induced by GTPγS can be fully restored by performing the same experiments with a 30% hypotonic solution to induce cell shrinkage (5 th bar graph). Also, the responses are restored simply applying enough suction to the pipette tip to cause a detectable amount of cell shrinkage (6 th bar graph). From these results, we suggest that latrunculin may inhibit endocytosis by allowing the PM to expand laterally and stretch, thereby generating lateral membrane tension that hinders membrane budding. This interpretation was proposed already decades ago to explain actin engagement in clathrin-mediated endoctyosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>  and WGA (green). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5B</ref> shows the time course of dextran uptake, determined from duplicate measurements at the time points indicated after initiating uptake. Dextran uptake saturates within about 10 min, and the apparent time constant of uptake is 7.4 min.</p><p>That OMDE may support constitutive PM turnover in starved T-REx293 cells is supported by the following results (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5C-5E</ref>). Inhibition and stimulation of uptake by bromopalmitate/albumin and palmitate/albumin complexes, respectively, are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5C</ref>. We employed albumin complexes of both compounds to avoid nonspecific membrane effects of these compounds and because albumin effectively delivers these compounds into cells via fatty acid transporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. Control uptake (blue)</p><p>was determined in the presence of 0.1 mM fatty acid-free albumin. Then, in the presence of 3:1 bromopalmitate/albumin complexes (0.3/0.1 mM), which inhibit DHHCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>, uptake is decreased by ~70%. In contrast, uptake is increased by 40% in the presence of equivalent palmitate/albumin complexes. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5D</ref>, dextran uptake is inhibited 60% by 1 μM cyclosporine A (CsA), a nonspecific cyclophilin ligand that is the best documented inhibitor of PTP openings <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref>, as well as massive endocytosis in patch clamp <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Subsequent results illustrate inhibition of dextran uptake by metabolites that may shift long-chain acyl-CoA into mitochondria or shift CoA from long-chain acyl-CoA to other CoA metabolites. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5D</ref>, uptake is decreased significantly in cells incubated for 10 min with carnitine (10 mM) or with butyrate (10 mM). Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5E</ref> shows that dextran uptake is decreased by a newly identified DHHC inhibitor (48) (PATi, 10 μM) and is significantly decreased by RhoA inhibition with C3-transferase (Rho Inhibitor I, ( <ref type="formula">49</ref>)). We mention in this connection that localized activation of RhoA has recently been shown to activate endocytosis that promotes migration of macrophages in an amoeboidal migration mode <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. Activation of dextran uptake by mitochondrial substrates and bicarbonate. Following up patch clamp studies in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref>, we next tested if (and when) mitochondrial substrates might significantly affect dextran uptake in T-REx293 cells. To do so, we first included the mitochondrial substrate, acetate (10 mM), in the saline solution employed, and we subsequently included bicarbonate (25 mM, at pH 7.2) to support cell carboxylase activities that might be essential for the effects of mitochondrial substrates. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref> shows results without bicarbonate. From left to right, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6A</ref> shows that cyclosporin A (1 μM) has a very strong inhibitory effect on dextran uptake in the presence of acetate. Carnitine (10 mM) is mildly inhibitory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6B</ref>) when compared to patch clamp results. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6C</ref>, pyruvate (10 mM) inhibits dextran uptake by about 30% in this cellular condition (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6C</ref>), while β-HB (10 mM) inhibits by nearly 80%, similar to cyclosporin A. Inhibition by pyruvate together with cyclosporin A is similar to cyclosporin alone. In Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S3</ref> we verify that metabolic substrates, specifically pyruvate and β-HB (which generate metabolites activated by CoA), do indeed reduce total long-chain acyl-CoAs by 30 to 50% in HEK293 cells under the conditions of these experiments (i.e without bicarbonate). We show further that carnitine significantly increases long-chain acyl-CoAs, presumably related to a shift of acyl groups into mitochondria.</p><p>These results raise an obvious enigma as to why pyruvate is inhibitory for endocytosis in starved, cultured cells but is strongly stimulatory in patch clamp studies. One possible explanation is that pyruvate diffuses rapidly into the cytoplasm during patch clamp experiments, while the cytoplasmic pyruvate concentration likely remains only a small fraction of extracellular pyruvate in experiments with intact cells. Accordingly, the generation of citric acid cycle metabolites from pyruvate may be limited by pyruvate metabolism in intact cells. Of the two pyruvate metabolism pathways, namely decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA and carboxylation to oxaloacetate <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>, the lack of bicarbonate in these experiments will limit the pathway to oxaloactetate. As described Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref>, the inclusion of bicarbonate (25 mM) in the saline solution employed indeed causes a consistently large stimulation of dextran uptake by pyruvate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strong stimulation of dextran endocytosis by pyruvate and its inhibition by β-HB and</head><p>bromopalmitate/albumin complexes. In patch clamp studies, pyruvate and β-HB typically have opposite (antagonistic) effects on endocytosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Therefore, we compared their effects and interactions in dextran uptake experiments in the presence of acetate and bicarbonate. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7A</ref>, β-HB (12 mM) reduced dextran uptake by just 50%. In same set of matched cell cultures, pyruvate (12 mM) increased dextran uptake by 2.5 fold. In the presence of β-HB (12 mM), pyruvate (12 mM) increased uptake only to the baseline uptake level. In other words, β-HB effectively blocks the stimulatory effect of pyruvate on endocytosis. As illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7B</ref>, the inhibitory effects of β-HB are even stronger than those of bromopalmitate/albumin complexes (0.2/0.1 mM) in equivalent experiments. BP complexes inhibit basal dextran uptake similarly to β-HB, about 50%, but pyruvate still increases dextran uptake in the presence of BP to a level that is greater than control uptake. We conclude that β-HB acts with some specificity to block the signaling mechanisms that pyruvate activates to stimulate dextran uptake. As already noted, an antioxidant activity of ketone bodies near or within mitochondrial membranes is one possible explanation <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7C</ref>, we therefore tested the antioxidant, edaravone (MCI-186) at the same concentration (0.1 mM) employed in patch clamp experiments. Different from β-HB, edaravone had no effect on dextran uptake in the control condition. However, edaravone ablated fully the stimulatory effect of pyruvate. This result clearly supports our hypothesis that generation of mitochondrial ROS during pyruvate metabolism is essential for its activation of endocytosis. The result is also consistent with the idea that β-HB acts to inhibit endocytosis by a mechanism besides antioxidant activity, one possibility being a reduction of long-chain acyl-CoAs.</p><p>Given that the effects of pyruvate to stimulate OMDE may involve ROS and the opening of PTPs to release CoA, the question is raised whether these mechanisms might cause cells to undergo apoptosis. To test this, we subjected dishes of cells to the protocols that induce endocytosis by pyruvate and then returned the cells to normal culture conditions (i.e with high glucose DMEM medium and 10% serum) for 1 day. After 24 h, we stained cells with trypan blue to test for the presence of dying or dead cells. As illustrated in Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref>, we found no evidence for damaged or apoptotic cells in cultures that were subjected to the pyruvate protocol.</p><p>Fatty acid-free albumin inhibits dextran uptake at low micromolar concentrations. In our early patch clamp experiments describing massive endocytosis in BHK cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, we found that OMDE was inhibited by treating cells with fatty acid free albumin, and we found that OMDE could be restored by restoring fatty acids that were presumably extracted from cells by albumin. Accordingly, we tested to what extent fatty acid free albumin might inhibit constitutive endocytosis in T-REx293 cells. To our surprise, we found that albumin was effective at low micromolar concentrations. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8A</ref> shows results</p><p>for subjecting cells to 15 μM albumin prior to, but not including, the time of dextran uptake. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8B</ref> shows results for continuous 15 μM albumin exposure, including the dextran incubation period. These protocols are illustrated above the bar graphs in each panel. For results in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8A</ref>, one group of cells was incubated with acetate/bicarbonate-containing saline for 60 min, and then with dextran for 4 min ("1."). The second group was incubated with saline for 30 min followed by saline with 15 μM albumin for 30 min, and finally with dextran and no albumin for 4 min ("2"). In a third group, albumin (15 μM) loaded with palmitate (30 μM) at a 2:1 ratio was applied for 30 min followed by dextran without albumin ("3").</p><p>As summarized by bar graphs, treatment with albumin reduced dextran uptake by 57%, whereas treatment with palmitate-loaded albumin reduced uptake by only 38%. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8B</ref> shows the equivalent results when albumin was administered for 10 min followed by dextran for 10 min with albumin or palmitate-loaded albumin. In this protocol, dextran uptake was reduced 40% by albumin, and the presence of palmitate entirely precluded inhibition by albumin. As described next, it appears that FA-free albumin indeed can in fact decrease palmitoylations of PM proteins that may be involved in endocytosis, an effect that would be consistent with localized FA and acyl-CoA turnover at the cytoplasmic face of the PM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inhibition of PM palmitoylations by carnitine, β-HB and FA-free albumin. Next, we tested</head><p>whether key protocols that inhibit or stimulate endocytosis in fact modify palmitoylations of membraneassociated proteins. To do so we incubated 10 cm dishes of T-REx293 cells equivalently to the protocols employed for uptake assays. Cells were incubated with the saline solution containing acetate and bicarbonate for 1 h. Thereafter, cells were incubated with either 10 mM carnitine + 10 mM β-HB or with 15 μM FA-free albumin for 20 min. Separate groups of experiments were performed with addition of 10 mM pyruvate, harvesting three dishes each after 2 and 10 min. Cells were then processed as described in Methods. Free cysteines were blocked immediately upon cell harvesting, a crude membrane fraction was isolated, proteins were deacylated with hydroxylamine, and proteins with free cysteines were pulled down thiol reactive agarose beads (G-Biosciences.com) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9A</ref> shows the average changes of protein counts for the four treatments examined with control counts normalized to 100%. As described in Methods, we normalized results for each protein sample to the counts obtained for caveolin-1, whose prevalence never changed significantly in the deacylated protein samples. Results shown were limited to the top 1200 protein species identified in the deacylated samples, more than 90% of which were enriched more than two-fold in hydoxylamineversus TRIS-treated samples. As shown in the bar graphs, 20 min exposures to carnitine and β-HB decreased protein counts on average by 52% (p&lt;0.001), which 20 min exposure to FA-free albumin (15 μM) decreased average protein counts by 50% (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, treatment of cells with pyruvate (10 mM) for 2 min increased average deacylated protein counts by 69% (p&lt;0.001) and the continued exposure to pyruvate (10mM) for 8 further minutes increased the average deacylated protein counts to 209% of control counts.</p><p>Selected results from the proteomic analysis are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9B</ref>. In brief, the palmitoylation of many PM proteins, confirmed multiple times in the SwissPalm palmitoylation database with at least 3 different methods (https://swisspalm.org), are decreased. Notably, many of the proteins that follow the average pattern described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9A</ref>, while identified by multiple methods in the SwissPalm data base, do not have high stringency sequences for palmitoylation as represented in the CSS-Palm 4.0 palmitoylation predictor program (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>). From top to bottom, caveolin-1 prevalence did not change in this experiments, presumably indicating that at least on palmitoylation remains with all treatments employed. Flotillin-1 palmitoylation decreased significantly with albumin, but not other flotillin result was striking. Examples of proteins that mirrored the average results, or showed still larger changes, included the transferrin receptor, β-tubulin 4B, cathepsin B, integrin β1, myosin-9, vimentin, filamins A and B, annexins-5, -1,-2,-6 and -11, and calpain-1. The identification of multiple Annexin proteins in this assay may be relevant to OMDE activation by Ca <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, and the cytoskeleton-associated proteins identified, including vimentin and filamins, may be relevant to the actin-dependence of OMDE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reciprocal effects of palmitoylation on uptake of cholera toxin B (CTB) and transferrin (TF).</head><p>Knowing that multiple biological interventions that inhibit or stimulate OMDE also would appear to inhibit or stimulate palmitoylations similarly, we next examined the effects of one of those treatments (carnitine+β-HB) on endocytosis defined by two classical membrane markers, CTB and TF. While neither of these probes is entirely specific, CTB binds selectively GM1 gangliosides and is internalized primarily by clathrin/dynamin-independent mechanisms. We note however that CTB is also taken up to some extent by clathrin endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56)</ref> in addition to 'raft' endocytosis. TF, on the other hand, is internalized primarily by classical clathrin-dependent endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>. Using a 2 min uptake assay under substrate-and serum-free conditions to define constitutive uptake, the uptake magnitudes were similar for the two probes (see micrographs in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>, and composite results in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10D</ref>). Nevertheless, uptake of CTB was decreased ~40% by the carnitine/β-HB treatment (p&lt;0.01) while TF uptake was significantly increased (p&lt;0.01). Regarding the increase of TF uptake, it was described already in 1990 that transferrin palmitoylation hinders clathrin endocytosis and that depalmitoylation promotes iron uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>. Overall, these results verify that the major two pathways of endocytosis, as defined here, are affected differently by interventions that affect formation of ordered membrane domains. The results are consistent with OMDE mediating much of the CTB uptake occurring in T-REx293 cells. While OMDE contributes to basal PM turnover in T-REx293 cells, a substantial contribution of clathrin endocytosis is also indicated.</p></div>

To acutely inhibit OMDE, we treated cells simultaneously with carnitine (5 mM) and β-HB (5 mM) for 30 min.

Cell morphology was stable, and the number of particles in the size range from 85 to 130 nm was significantly decreased. Assuming that OMDE is primarily blocked in these experiments, rather than clathrin endocytosis, we conclude that the vesicles formed by OMDE are on average larger than vesicles formed by clathrin endocytosis but substantially smaller than vesicles formed by macropinocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion.</head><p>In this article we verify that three forms of "activated" OMDE are supported by and/or require the acyltransferases, DHHC5 and DHHC2. We have compared constitutive endocytosis in T-REx293 cells and murine BMMs, and the outcomes are very different. Without serum, substrates, or bicarbonate, T-REx293 cells have a large endocytic flux that is consistent with OMDE under mitochondrial control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>), and equivalent experiments in BMMs are entirely negative (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref>). In contrast to "activated" OMDE, we find no involvement of DHHC5 or DHHC2 acyltransferases in constitutive OMDE in T-REx293 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5F</ref>). We have shown that mitochondrial metabolites, namely succinate, pyruvate and β-HA, can markedly modify OMDE, and that classical clathrin endocytosis can be affected in a reciprocal manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">10</ref>). Remarkably low FA-free albumin concentrations can inhibit constitutive OMDE in parallel with an apparent decrease of PM protein palmitoylations (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref>), while pyruvate stimulation of OMDE appears to be accompanied by increased palmitoylations of many PM-associated proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref>). Finally, we have analyzed the physical basis of constitutive OMDE via STED microscopy in T-REx293 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref>). Endocytic vesicles formed have diameters of 90 to roughly 140 microns, They are thus larger than average vesicles formed via coated pits (i.e. clathrin endocytosis) but substantially smaller than vesicles formed by macropinocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>. We discuss the Results roughly in the order of their presentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OMDE activated by G-proteins and oxidative metabolism in T-REx293 cells and BBMs.</head><p>We have documented in Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">4</ref> the extraordinary power of OMDE when activated by cytoplasmic GTPγS or mitochondrial substrates in T-REx293 cells and murine BBMs. The occurrence of massive endocytosis in the presence of a high (0.2 mM) concentration of GTYγS, which cannot be hydrolyzed by dynamins, makes the involvement of dynamin GTPase very unlikely <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. While we have not defined which G-proteins are essential, the involvement of multiple small G-proteins in clathrin/dynamin-independent endocytosis has been well established for decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61)</ref>. Inhibition of the small G-protein RhoA is clearly inhibitory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5E</ref>). We demonstrate in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">2</ref> that OMDE activated in both T-Rex293 cells and BMMs is dependent on DHHC2 and/or DHHC5, as well as actin cytoskeleton. In the case of T-REx293 cells we have used siRNA of these two DHHC enzymes, known to reach the PM <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>, to demonstrate a dependence of GTPγS-activated OMDE on acyltransferase activity. In the case of BMMs, we have employed cells from DHHC5 gene-trapped animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> to demonstrate dependence of succinate-activated OMDE on acyltransferase activity.</p><p>For lung fibroblasts and acutely isolated peritoneal macrophages, we have also demonstrated a dependence of succinate-activated OMDE on DHHC5 with cells from gene-trapped animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3A</ref>).</p><p>Concerning actin-dependence, endocytosis induced both by GTPγS and by succinate metabolism is decreased more than 60% by latrunculin (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3E</ref>). This contrasts to our previous studies of massive endocytosis induced by Ca elevations in which latrunculin was without effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31)</ref>. One obvious difference between the different forms of OMDE is that Ca elevation initially causes a large PM expansion in most cell types, which may relax PM tension <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Consistent with this interpretation, the block of OMDE in T-REx293 cells by latrunculin can be fully overcome by cell shrinkage, employing either hypotonic cytoplasmic solutions or negative pressure applied to the pipette tip (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3B</ref>). Both of these interventions will with little doubt decrease lateral membrane tension. It will now be of considerable interest to test whether inhibitory effects of actin disruption on 'bulk endocytosis' in neurons ( <ref type="formula">62</ref>) are also dependent on lateral PM tension.</p><p>We have suggested previously that ROS generation by mitochondria is a major signaling factor that promotes massive endocytosis via OMDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. ROS may act through many signaling mechanisms, including the activation of small G-proteins ( <ref type="formula">63</ref>) such as RhoA <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>. In addition, however, our work suggests that the opening of mitochondrial PTPs (permeability transition pores) is critical, namely to release mitochondrial metabolites, in particular CoA, to the cytoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. These suggestions are supported presently by the effective block of succinate-activated OMDE in BMMs by the mitochondriaspecific cyclosporin, NIM811, and the inhibition observed with two antioxidants, edaravone and tiron (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Admittedly, tiron is not specific, as it chelates iron and other multivalent metals <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. We point out in this connection that attempts to block PTP openings with antioxidants have often had mixed or complex outcomes (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66)</ref>). The effectivity of edaravone in both patch clamp and dextran uptake assays (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7C</ref>) is impressive, and this is consistent with the clinical application of edaravone in ALS <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref>.</p><p>The consistently small magnitude of OMDE that occurs with β-HB, and the ability of β-HB to suppress pyruvate activation of OMDE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7A</ref>), may be relevant to its beneficial effects in several degenerative disease models (e.g. ( <ref type="formula">68</ref>)). The fact that cytoplasmic pyruvate, like succinate, strongly activates OMDE in both T-Rex293 cells and in BBMs was surprising, since within the cytoplasm pyruvate likely has antioxidant functions (e.g.( <ref type="formula">69</ref>)). Presumably, ROS generation at or within the inner mitochondrial membrane is critical for PTP openings and the progression of OMDE. In the simplest case, β-HB may function as a membrane-near antioxidant at the critical mitochondrial sites, presumably the immediate vicinity of cytochrome oxidases. Importantly, we have shown that β-HB can reduce longchain acyl-CoAs in cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S3</ref>), an effect that rationally explains why β-HB is more effective than edaravone in reducing OMDE in the absence of pyruvate (FIg. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref>).</p><p>The speed and magnitude of OMDE activated by succinate and pyruvate in BBMs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>) are unprecedented for any form of biological endocytosis known to us. On average 77% of the PM is removed within 2 to 3 minutes. Since these responses can occur even when cytoplasmic Ca is heavily buffered (10 mM EGTA with 3 mM Ca (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3B</ref>)), Ca elevations are definitively not required. As already stressed, the generation of ROS and PTP openings are both implicated for succinate-induced OMDE. The fact that endocytosis induce by pipette perfusion of GTPγS is very similar in magnitude (and speed) indicates that G-proteins besides dynamins are very likely involved.</p><p>Nonionic detergents are long known to cause phase separations of complex membranes at low concentrations (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>). Thus, the induction of very large endocytic responses low concentrations of TritonX-100 in BMMs is further consistent with our hypothesis that growth of ordered domains drives the endocytic responses to mitochondrial substrates and GTPγS. These results support further the notion that phase separations of plasma membranes involves the lateral rearrangement of both lipids and PM proteins. By involving PM proteins, especially palmitoylated proteins with large cytoplasmic domains, OMDE can likely internalize larger fractions of the PM and generate smaller vesicles than would be expected for lipid rafts, per se. <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The constitutive roles and regulation of PTPs.</head><p>While it is firmly established that mitochondrial PTP openings are associated with mitochondrial depolarization, and eventually the initiation of cell death programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>, the physical identity of PTPs and their signaling roles in normal cell physiology remain controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73)</ref>. That PTPs can open transiently in a so-called 'flickering' mode during normal cell physiology is well established, and such openings are in general thought to have a low conductance that is adequate for depolarization, release of calcium, and generation of 'flashes' of mitochondrial ROS. Our hypothesis, however, that PTPs can release significant amounts of CoA physiologically requires that physiological PTP openings generate a significant permeability to relatively large solutes. In fact, studies employing calcein release to monitor PTP openings do indeed document significant solute release in a spontaneous and maintained fashion from subpopulations of mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75)</ref>, and such openings have been implicated to initiate signaling that reprograms the development of certain cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76)</ref>.

It is as least plausible that nonspecific solute release represents an evolutionarily primitive form of intercellular signaling (e.g. ( <ref type="formula">78</ref>)).</p><p>A strong limitation of our work on OMDE up to now has been the fact that most experiments involved patch clamp, an experimental model that does not readily allow biochemical studies. The protocols described in this study, which activate and modify OMDE in cells growing in dishes, open a wide range of new experimental possibilities to study OMDE. The strong effects of cyclosporin A and pyruvate on dextran uptake in cells cultured with bicarbonate (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref>), for example, provide new ways to test whether the generation of long-chain acyl-CoAs and cysteine palmitoylations really underlie the initiation of OMDE.</p><p>Constitutive activity of OMDE is highly variable between cell types.</p><p>Often, attempts to define specific endocytic mechanisms and their involvement in PM turnover employ molecular biological means to overexpress or to delete individual endocytic proteins. The caveat then is that cells may adapt and compensate genetic interventions in the time frame required to induce protein changes. We elected therefore, for the purposes of this article, to examine acute interventions that with reasonable confidence can indicate which mechanisms are active. To test whether OMDE under mitochondrial control is constitutively active in T-REx293 cells, we initially cultured cells without serum, substrates, or bicarbonate for 1 h in a physiological saline solution. In this environment (Fig.</p><p>3</p><p>), we found that PM turnover was strongly decreased by bromopalmitate/albumin complexes and could be increased by albumin/palmitate complexes. These results are not highly specific, but together with other results do suggest that palmitoylations of PM proteins support basal PM turnover.</p><p>Turnover is decreased by &gt;50% by a cyclosporin (cyclosporin A) that suppresses PTP openings. Of course, cyclosporin A also inhibits the phosphatase, calcineurin (79), although rather high concentrations appear to be required to definitively decrease clathrin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(80)</ref>.</p><p>We have shown previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>, as well as in the present study (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3E</ref>), that the mitochondriaspecific cyclosporin, NIM811 (81), effectively inhibits OMDE. Furthermore, constitutive PM turnover is decreased by a recently developed DHHC inhibitor, PATi <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. Basal PM turnover is significantly decreased by carnitine, expected to shift acyl-CoA from the cytoplasm into mitochondria via the intermediate, acyl-carnitine. In addition, basal PM turnover is inhibited significantly by inhibiting the small G-protein, RhoA. consistent with evidence that multiple forms of OMDE are dependent on small G protein activity. In the presence acetate (10 mM) but no bicarbonate, inhibition of dextran endocytosis by cyclosporin A is particularly strong, as is the inhibition by hydroxybutyrate. Inhibition by carnitine is significant, and pyruvate itself is just as inhibitory (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>). Importantly, we have verified that both β-HV and pyruvate indeed decrease long-chain acyl CoAs under these specific conditions.</p><p>The results together clearly support the idea that OMDE under mitochondrial control contributes to constitutive PM turnover in T-REx293 cells. Impressively, all of these same experiments yield negative results for constitutive PM turnover in differentiated BMMs, even though OMDE, when activated, can be much more powerful in BMMs than in T-REx293 cells.</p><p>As noted in the Introduction, the present study was initiated in response to an article suggesting that constitutive PM turnover in HeLa cells occurs exclusively via conventional clathrin/dynamindependent endocytosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>. We were surprised at this result, given that OMDE can be extraordinarily powerful when activated. But the clear outcome of the present study is that OMDE may or may not play significant roles in basal PM turnover. In strong contrast to results for T-REx293 cells, experiments using BMMs do not suggest any role of OMDE in basal PM turnover (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12</ref>), defined as here as PM turnover that occurs without serum, substrates, or bicarbonate. Clearly, the role of OMDE in constitutive PM turnover is highly variable and certainly will depend on signaling status of cells in culture. In the present study it is also notable that constitutive endocytosis in T-REx293 cells dependent on fatty acids and several factors that are shown to change palmitoylations, but it is not dependent on the presence of the DHHC2 or DHHC5 acyltransferases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5F</ref>). Given that cells contain more than 20 DHHC isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82)</ref>, it would not be surprising if different DHHC enzymes are critical in different cell conditions. Assuming that coenzyme A and long-chain acyl-CoAs occur at relatively low concentrations in the conditions of these measurements, DHHC enzymes with relatively high affinities for substrates might likely be required.</p></div>

In fact, the adhesion receptor, CD44, and the scavenger receptor, CD36, were both shown 20 years ago to internalize via ordered membrane domains (rafts) in a palmitoylation-dependent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84)</ref>. By demonstrating apparently wide-spread changes of palmitoylations, which correlate qualitatively substrate-dependent changes of OMDE (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">9</ref>), the present work supports the idea that palmitoylation-dependent OMDE is likely to be a physiologically important mechanisms of PM turnover. In some cases, interventions that are expected to block the OMDE pathway outlined in Fig. As noted in the Introduction and documented in Results, OMDE involves the ordering of both lipids and membrane proteins into domains and can also involve the actin cytoskeleton.Thus, OMDE does not rely only on membrane ordering to drive vesiculation. It seems likely at this time that the presence of different protein cargos initiates OMDE with different physical characteristic. In the form of OMDE dubbed 'CLIC', for example, the palmitoylated 'raft' protein, CD44, is a major cargo, and endocytic vesicles take on a tubular form that may be determined both by CD44 and the branching of actin cytoskeleton that appears to contribute to the endocytic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85)</ref>. Up to now, visualizing endocytic structures with STED microscopy, we have not clearly observed tubular structures.</p><p>Accordingly, it will be important to test whether the overexpression of different cargo proteins can dictate how OMDE develops and which structural features can be influenced by the expression of different cargos.</p><p>The present body of work provides a new basis to analyze OMDE using coordinated patch clamp and cell culture/biochemical approaches. An especially surprising result, which requires further experimental attention, is that low concentrations of FA-free albumin substantially decrease OMDE in parallel with a decrease PM protein palmitoylations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref>). Two interpretations of these results are still possible. On the one hand, albumin is known to directly interact with membranes, in particular cholesterol-rich membranes (e.g. ( <ref type="formula">86</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84)</ref>, uptake of nanoparticles and proteins by heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(94,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">95)</ref>, and uptake of multiple viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(96)</ref>. Additionally, the clustering of some membrane transporters, independent of ligands, promotes their endocytosis in a cargo-dependent manner without involvement of classical endocytic proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">97)</ref>. nuclei merge so that automated nuclei counts are inaccurate. Therefore, we determined the total nuclear area from outlines and divided by an average nucleus area, determined from &gt;50 measurements. The estimate was 144 nuclei. Similar to 5 other cases, differences between this automated cell count and manual counts was less than 15% . E-G. Representative analysis of dextran uptake. The results are from Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">7</ref>, showing the effect of FA-free albumin (15 μM) and palmitate-loaded albumin (15/30 μM) on dextran uptake. 7. E. Particle counts per cell, determined as in in panels A-D. Average particle counts for 4 min dextran uptake were ~100 particles per cell. Counts were reduced by 63% with albumin exposure, while they were only marginally decreased by albumin/palmitate complexes. F. Particle counts with minimum particle diameter set to 0.2 microns. Control particle counts are reduced to about 20 per cell when the size limit is set to the wavelength of light. As described in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref>, analysis with STED microscopy verifies that particle counts without a lower dimension limit are more correct. We note also that the imposition of a lower particle size limit artificially distorts the magnitude of the inhibitory effect of albumin (see Panel F versus Panel E). G. Representative for more than 20 observations, changes of dye uptake, as accessed by particle counts, are essentially the same when dye uptake is quantified as endosome (particle) area divided by total nuclear area.       were incubated for 60 min with acetate/bicarbonate-containing saline followed by 4 min dextran uptake ("1"). The second ("2") and third ("3") sets of cells were incubated with saline for 30 min followed by 30 min with 15 μM albumin or 15 μM albumin with 30 μM palmitate. Dextran uptake was then initiated for 4 min in the absence of albumin and palmitate. Albumin exposure inhibited subsequent dextran uptake by 54%. B. As indicated above the bar graphs, control cells were incubated in bicarbonate/acetate-containing saline for 60 min, followed by dextran uptake for 4 min ("1"). Additional sets of cells were incubated for 50 min with saline followed by 10 min with albumin (15 μM) or albumin with palmitate (15 μM/30 μM). Dextran uptake was then initiated for 4 min with albumin or albumin with palmitate, as indicated. The inhibitory effect of albumin alone amounted to 39%, and the presence of palmitate with albumin ablated the inhibitory effect of albumin.    Dextran uptake under these conditions is not less in DHHC5 gene-trapped BMMs than in WT BMMs.</p><note type="other">Figure Legends.</note></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>.</head><label></label><figDesc>Unless stated otherwise, chemicals were from Sigma-Millipore (St. Louis, MO) and were the highest grade available.

Verified oligonucleotide sequences were employed to knock down DHHC5 and DHHC2 via transfection with Lipofectamine RNAiMA, and knockdown was verified by Western blotting and qPCR for DHHC5. Knockdown of DHHC2 was verified by qPCR. As apparent in Fig.5F, neither the knockdown of DHHC5, nor DHHC2, nor knockdown of both DHHCs significantly changed the constitutive uptake of dextran by T-REx293 cells. We conclude therefore that these DHHCs are not essential for constitutive PM turnover in these cells.

In general, inhibitory interventions reduce constitutive endocytosis in T-REx293 cells by about 50% (Figs. 5-8 and Fig.10), and it is very possible that larger effects of cyclosporin A and bromopalmitate may be nonspecific. Importantly, and perhaps most definitive, our analysis of dextran uptake via STED microscopy (Fig.11) is consistent with palmitoylation-dependent OMDE and conventional endocytosis making up approximately equal shares of constitutive PM turnover in this cell type. Of course, this does not change the fact that OMDE can become much more powerful when activated.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>)). It remains possible therefore that FA-free albumin might induce changes of membrane structure, possibly PM ordering, that either inhibit the palmitoylation of PM proteins or promote the depalmitoylation of PM proteins. On the other hand, the extraction of FAs from the PM by albumin might decrease the availability of FAs on the cytoplasmic side for activation by acyl-CoA synthetase(s) associated with the PM and their subsequent use by DHHCs to palmitoylate PM proteins. One candidate, ACSL1, appears to directly associate with the FA transporter, FATP1, at the plasma membrane<ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(87)</ref>. Clear experimental support for one or the other of these hypotheses will have profound implications. In the former case, physical forces within the PM, related to local membrane tension and protein conformation would be key to the regulation palmitoylations at the PM. In the latter case, local turnover and metabolism of FAs will be key to the local control of plasma membrane palmitoylation and the operation of OMDE. Acknowledgements.

Mitochondria accumulate coenzyme A to a high concentration with respect to cytoplasm and release it into the cytoplasm during metabolic stress, e.g. postischemic stress (21, 88), but also via constitutive PTP openings Cytoplasmic CoA (89) and acetyl-Co A (90) concentrations fluctuate enough to influence enzymes that use them as cofactors and substrates. Thus, both molecules have second messenger functions. CoA is released from mitochondria via transient PTP openings that occur physiologically as mitochondria accumulate Ca and oxidize critical cysteines (e.g. (91)). Elevations of cytoplasmic CoA promote acyl-CoA synthesis and subsequently DHHC acyltransferase activity.

Finally, the final bar graph (blue) shows that equivalent OMDE responses are activated by 90 μM Triton-X100 without Ca or substrates, presumably because nonionic detergents at low concentration induce membrane phase separations in complex membranes<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref> and thereby promote strongly OMDE.Results shown in Fig.4verify in two further cell types that OMDE responses induced by succinate are dependent on DHHC acyltransferase activity.
