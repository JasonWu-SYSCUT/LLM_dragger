<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background: Binding of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to TNF-receptor 1 (TNF-R1) can induce either cell survival or cell death. The selection between these diametrically opposed effects depends on the subcellular location of TNF-R1: plasma membrane retention leads to survival, while endocytosis leads to cell death. How the respective TNF-R1 associated signaling complexes are recruited to the distinct subcellular location is not known. Here, we identify palmitoylation of TNF-R1 as a molecular mechanism to achieve signal diversification.</p><p>Methods: Human monocytic U937 cells were analyzed. Palmitoylated proteins were enriched by acyl resin assisted capture (AcylRAC) and analyzed by western blot and mass spectrometry. Palmitoylation of TNF-R1 was validated by metabolic labeling. TNF induced depalmitoylation and involvement of APT2 was analyzed by enzyme activity assays, pharmacological inhibition and shRNA mediated knock-down. TNF-R1 palmitoylation site analysis was done by mutated TNF-R1 expression in TNF-R1 knock-out cells. Apoptosis (nuclear DNA fragmentation, caspase 3 assays), NF-κB activation and TNF-R1 internalization were used as biological readouts.</p><p>Results: We identify dynamic S-palmitoylation as a new mechanism that controls selective TNF signaling. TNF-R1 itself is constitutively palmitoylated and depalmitoylated upon ligand binding. We identified the palmitoyl thioesterase APT2 to be involved in TNF-R1 depalmitoylation and TNF induced NF-κB activation. Mutation of the putative palmitoylation site C248 interferes with TNF-R1 localization to the plasma membrane and thus, proper signal transduction.</p><p>Conclusions: Our results introduce palmitoylation as a new layer of dynamic regulation of TNF-R1 induced signal transduction at a very early step of the TNF induced signaling cascade. Understanding the underlying mechanism may allow novel therapeutic options for disease treatment in future.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) regulates a variety of cellular processes ranging from inflammation, proliferation, to differentiation, and can induce various forms of cell death. TNF signal transduction occurs via binding of the ligand to two different receptors: TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, two members of the TNF-receptor superfamily. TNF-R1 belongs to the subgroup of death receptors (DR) and can induce cell death via its C-terminal "death domain" (DD). The selective recruitment of distinct adaptor proteins to the activated TNF-R1 determines whether cell survival or cell death signaling prevails <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Immediately upon ligand binding, the "complex I" adaptor proteins TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and c-IAP1 are recruited to the DD of TNF-R1. Signaling from "complex I" is regulated by ubiquitination and finally triggers NF-κB nuclear translocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. We and others have shown that this initial signaling cascade is based on plasma membrane resident TNF-R1. One mechanism that shifts the system toward cell death signaling is K63ubiquitination of TNF-R1, leading to its internalization by formation of TNF-containing endosomes (receptosomes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. TNF-R1 internalization triggers K48-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of TRAF2 and RIP1, followed by "complex II" formation by the recruitment of the "death inducing signaling complex" (DISC) proteins FADD and caspase-8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. TNF-receptosomes are also a source for the production of reactive oxygen species by recruitment of riboflavin kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Together, these events are the initial triggers for cell death.</p><p>Intracellular trafficking of TNF-receptosomes and fusion with trans-Golgi vesicles facilitates maturation towards a multivesicular/lysosomal compartment. Here, a proteolytic cascade leads to the formation of ceramide via acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) and translocation of active cathepsin D (CtsD) into the cytoplasm. CtsD cleaves and then degrades the antiapoptotic chaperone HSP90, and activates BID by truncation to tBID. tBID is involved in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Many players involved in the regulation of TNF-R1 signal transduction are known (for review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>). What remains enigmatic is: How are these proteins recruited to a distinct subcellular localization (i.e. discrete membrane domains or compartments) to form functional protein complexes at the right time upon TNF stimulation?</p><p>The reversible post-translational protein modification of cysteine residues with a palmitic acid through thioester formation (S-palmitoylation) is known to modulate target protein interactions with lipids and with other proteins. The palmitoyl group is attached to a target protein by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PAT) containing the characteristic Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif. In mammals, 23 zDHHC containing proteins have been identified. Palmitoylation is fully reversible and depalmitoylation is catalyzed by palmitoyl thioesterases (PTE). The best-described PTEs are the cytosolic APT1, APT2, and the lysosomal PPT1, but the family is growing, e.g. through the identification of the ABDH17 proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Palmitoylation of proteins can have various different functions and has an impact on different biological processes and diseases, as summarized in various extensive reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</p><p>Here, we identify palmitoylation as a novel molecular switch that modulates TNF-R1 mediated signaling. Our initial observations that pharmacological interference with palmitoylation modulates TNF-R1 internalization prompted us to investigate how lipidation regulates TNF-R1 signaling. We focused on the palmitoylation state of TNF-R1, showing that its de-palmitoylation in response to TNF is mediated by the PTE APT2. Knock down of APT2 enhances apoptosis but blocks signaling via NF-κB. Mutagenesis of the putative palmitoylation site C248 altered TNF-R1 surface expression resulting in both, reduced cell death and NF-κB signaling.</p></div>

In this study, we focused on the monocytic cell line U937, as it responds to to TNF binding with both, NF-κB activation and apoptosis induction without further need for cell death sensitization by i.e. cycloheximide. Application of the commonly used palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2BrP) decreased TNF-R1 internalization after 30 min in 50% of the cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). To analyze this, cells were cooled down on ice in the presence/ absence of 2BrP followed by labeling the receptor with biotinylated-TNF/Streptavidin-Alexafluor488. A temperature shift to 37 °C subsequently allowed internalization of the TNF recepors, which was quantified by imaging flow cytometry. Importantly, the surface expression of TNF-R1 at steady state, prior to internalization was not affected by the inhibitor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). These results indicate that S-palmitoylation plays a functional role in TNF signaling. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of TNF-R1 palmitoylation</head><p>Based on the observation that perturbation of S-palmitoylation by 2BrP altered TNF signaling, we hypothesized that TNF-R1 may be palmitoylated itself, as palmitoylation of other death receptors (i.e. CD95, DR4 and DR6) and implications on their downstream signaling has been reported before <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. To confirm this assumption, we used acylRAC to enrich palmitoylated proteins from untreated and 10 min TNF stimulated cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref> and e shows the assessment of the purity of the samples by WB and SDS-PAGE. Probing WB for TNF-R1, we detected constitutive palmitoylation of TNF-R1 while no difference between untreated and TNF treated samples was apparent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, first panel). Interestingly, by comparing the input fractions (Σ TC ) and the HA fractions, not all cellular TNF-R1 appears to be palmitoylated. This could be explained by either inefficient capturing during acylRAC or by the assumption that only a certain pool of TNF-R1 is palmitoylated (i.e. receptors at the plasma membrane). As controls, we analyzed the samples for known palmitoylated proteins (CD71, STX6, Rab5B and PPT1) and β Actin and CoxIV as a non palmitoylated controls. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1e</ref> depicts the total protein stain to ensure equal loading <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. The total membrane input (Σ tc ) +/-TNF contains a variety of proteins, while fewer bands are visible in the hydroxylamine (HA) fraction. The control (Tris) lanes are absent of protein, indicating the enrichment was successful.</p><p>To investigate whether endogenous TNF may affect TNF-R1 palmitoylation, we incubated U937 in the presence of an anti-TNF-Fab' for 14 days, followed by acyl-RAC/WB analysis. In both, untreated and TNF-Fab' treated cells, TNF-R1 was found to be palmitoylated (Additional file 1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1f</ref> shows validation of TNF-R1 palmitoylation by metabolic labeling using the 17-ODYA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. TNF-R1 was initially depleted from the PM using histamine treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> (left panel). During recovery, 17-ODYA was incorporated, biotinylated by click chemistry and precipitated, followed by western blot analysis (right panels). We observed no metabolic labeling of TNF-R1 in cells without previous histamine treatment (data not shown). We conclude that TNF-R1 palmitoylation on at least one site occurs during ER/Golgi to PM translocation.</p><p>As the signal relayed by TNF-R1 can change over time from proliferation to cell death, we hypothesized that TNF-R1 palmitoylation might also change over time. Indeed, using acylRAC and western blot analysis, we observed that the constitutive TNF-R1 palmitoylation was followed by de-palmitoylation at later time points (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g-j</ref>). As an attempt to quantify TNF-induced changes in palmitoylation of TNF-R1 and other proteins, we applied similar acylRAC samples to mass spectrometric analysis. The overall changes were modest and could not be quantified (Additional file 4: Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). TNF-R1 was also not among the identified proteins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of TNF-R1 palmitoylation sites</head><p>Comparing the TNF-R1 sequence across species revealed four conserved (C223, 248, 395, 433) and two less conserved cysteine residues (C304 and 442) (Additional file 2: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref> shows a topology model of TNF-R1 including the cysteine residues in its intracellular domain. The occurrence of palmitoylation sites in close proximity to transmembrane domains (TMD) or even within TMD is common between other receptor systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Palmitoylation of CD95, DR4 and DR6 occurs on cysteines close to the respective TMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Using was shed from the cell surface by histamine treatment (red). After 16 h recovery (black curve) the expression resembled the untreated status (green curve). TNF-R1 was labeled using biotinTNF:Streptavidin alexafluor488. Fluorescence intensity mas measured by imaging flow cytometry. Right panel: During recovery phase, 17-ODYA was added to the cells and incorporated into protein palmitoylated within this time frame. After biotinylation of 17-ODYA by click-chemistry and precipitation using streptavidin microbeads, the material was analyzed by WB and compared to lysate as input control. Upper panel: Probing for TNF-R1 showed TNF-R1 in the 17-ODYA treated and the lysate fraction (input). Lower panel: Biotinylated Concanavalin A was used as positive control for biotinylated proteins. g TNF-R1 WB from acylRAC samples isolated from 0 to 60 min shows a constant decrease in palmitoylated TNF-R1 up to 60 min. h Total protein staining for equal loading prior to WB. i WB of total cell lysate corresponding to the fractions of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref> and<ref type="figure">h</ref>. The total amount of TNF-R1 was constant over time with a slight decrease at 60 min. β Actin serves as loading control. j Quantitative WB analysis showing TNF-R1 depalmitoylation kinetics (n = 8). All values were normalized to the total TNF-R1 abundance in cell lysates. ***: significant TNF-R1 depalmitoylation (p ≤ 0.001) the CSS-palm algorithm, Cys248 was predicted as one putative palmitoylation site <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Thus, we next generated TNF-R1 knock-out U937 cells (ΔTNF-R1) and retransfected them with FLAG-tagged C248S mutated TNF-R1 (C248S). TNF-R1 expression was analyzed by WB, showing that C248S cellular expression was higher compared to TNF-R1 in wt U937 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b</ref>). The two bands recognized by TNF-R1 antibodies are indicated by arrowheads filled (lower MW) empty (higher MW). Conversely, TNF-R1 surface labeling revealed a reduced surface expression of C248S (filled green) compared to TNF-R1 wt (green) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>), suggesting that Cys248 is involved in the transport of TNF-R1 to the cell surface. Incubation of labeled cells for 30 min at 37 °C increased fluorescence intensity due to clustering and internalization of the receptors (TNF-R1 wt : red; TNF-R1 C248S : filled red Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2c</ref>). We next analyzed TNF induced apoptosis, showing that TNF-R1 C248S expression restores apoptosis induction compared to ΔTNF-R1 cells, while the percentage of apoptotic cells was less compared to wt cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d</ref>). TNF induced NF-κB activation was quantified by measuring IκB degradation by WB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2e</ref>), showing that NF-κB activation was reduced.</p><p>To analyze whether the cysteine 248 is the only putative palmitoylation site, we performed acylRAC from wt and mutant TNF-R1 expressing cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2f</ref> ). While TNF-R1 was precipitated in both cell lines, the signal was reduced in TNF-R1 C248S expressing cells compared to wt cells. Interestingly, the resulting protein band pattern was altered. While the HA fraction from wt cells showed mainly the high MW variant of TNF-R1 (empty arrowhead), the lower MW variant (filled arrowhead) is much more prominent in TNF-R1 C248S expressing cells. Thus, we conclude that C248 is not the only TNF-R1 palmitoylation site but it is required for proper transport of the receptor to the plasma membrane and also for the activation of NF-κB.</p><p>Despite large efforts, expression of wildtype or other cysteine mutated TNF-R1 in ΔTNF-R1 U937 cells was toxic and thus, could not be included in the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of APT2 as a TNF-R1 palmitoyl thioesterase</head><p>As we observed depalmitoylation of TNF-R1, we strived to identify the responsible enzyme. PPT1 has been reported to be localized in lysosomes, while APT1 and APT2 are localized in the cytoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Thus, we focused on APT1 and 2 and performed TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) co-IP using Fc60TNF as bait: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> shows an initial constitutive and after 10 min a decreasing interaction of APT1, while APT2 is transiently recruited with a maximum at 5 min. TNF-R1 gets ubiquitinated and thus its molecular weight increases in the same period, as reported before <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. To investigate the role of APT1 and 2, we treated cells with TNF and measured the enzyme activity in live cells using fluorescent "depalmitoylation probes" (DPPs) and imaging flow cytometry <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. DPP-2 reports on global depalmitoylase activities, while DPP-3 has increased preference for APT1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>, left side shows the transient TNF/time dependent increase in the fluorescent signal from DPP-2. The peak correlated with the observed transient APT2:TNF-RSC interaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>). However, DPP-3 showed no change in fluorescent signal upon stimulation, indicating that APT1 is not activated within the same time frame (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>, right side). If APT1 also has a role in TNF-R1 signaling, as the co-IP suggests, has to be analyzed.</p><p>We next investigated the impact of APT2 inhibition on TNF-R1 palmitoylation using the selective inhibitor ML349 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. The WB (left panel) and its quantification (right panel) show TNF-R1 depalmitoylation upon 30 min TNF stimulation. Incubation with ML349 followed by TNF treatment blocked TNF-R1 depalmitoylation, and incubation with ML349 alone led to accumulation of palmitoylated TNF-R1.</p><p>We next overexpressed and purified recombinant APT2 (rAPT2) for further functional analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3d</ref>). The upper panel shows enrichment of rAPT2, the lower panel shows analysis of the enzyme activity using the fluorescent probe (DPP-2). To check if APT2 de-palmitoylates TNF-R1 in vitro, incubation with rAPT was performed prior to acylRAC and WB analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3e</ref>): Palmitoylation of TNF-R1 decreased while other palmitoylated proteins (CD71, Integrin α6, PPT-1 and Rab5) were not affected. How this selectivity is achieved remains to be clarified.</p><p>To investigate the in vivo role of APT2 in TNF signaling, cells were then incubated with different concentrations of the inhibitor ML349. First, we observed slightly reduced TNF-R1 internalization from ~70% in untreated to ~45-60% of the ML349 treated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>). Second, analysis of apoptosis unexpectedly revealed enhanced apoptosis for ML349 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>). Probing WB for cleaved PARP1, and cleaved caspase-3 further validated these findings: Both proteins displayed enhanced cleavage upon 6 h co-incubation with TNF and ML349 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>).</p><p>Based on previous observations that apoptosis induction requires TNF-R1 internalization, we wondered, how this effect can be explained while TNF-R1 is inhibited using 50 μM ML349. Earlier reports by us and others showed activation of PM/caveolae resident nSMase in response to TNF, resulting in ceramide formation and apoptosis induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In our experiments, TNF also induced increased ceramide levels, which was enhanced by co-incubation with ML349 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4d</ref>). Inhibition of nSMase using GW4869 blocked ceramide production. Since overnight incubation with GW4869 was toxic, we monitored caspase activity after 4 h TNF stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>), showing that pretreatment with the Pharmacological inhibition of APT2 resulted in reduced NF-κB activation in response to TNF, compared to TNF treated cells in the absence of the APT2 inhibitor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>). Down modulation of APT2 using shRNA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5a</ref>) interestingly enhanced TNF-R1 surface expression compared to wt cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5b</ref>). The inhibitory effect on TNF-R1 depalmitoylation was similar to inhibition of APT2 using ML349 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5c</ref>). Down modulation of APT2 did not reduce TNF-R1 internalization (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5d</ref>) and increased the apoptotic response (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5e</ref>) which is in line with the effects of ML349 shown before in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4b</ref>. Interestingly, treatment of U937 cells with TNF resulted in slightly stronger signals for PPT-1 in acylRAC samples, which was also apparent in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c</ref>.</p><p>Activation of the NF-κB pathway was also blocked in shAPT2 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5f</ref> ), similar to pharmacological APT2 inhibition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Several earlier studies by us and others showed that the biological outcome of TNF signaling depends on the subcellular localization of the activated TNF-R1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Receptors residing in the plasma membrane signal for cell survival via "complex I" formation while endocytosis of TNF-R1 changes signaling capacity to induction of cell death by DISC recruitment / "complex II" formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. These diametrically opposed effects have to be tightly regulated, to ensure controlled biological outcomes. While we recently showed that TNF-R1 has to be K63-ubiquitinated to allow its internalization and thereby, switching to cell death signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> others showed that linear ubiquitination of TNF-R1 is essential for NF-κB signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. How the formation of the distinct signaling complexes is orchestrated in the correct spatio-temporal context is still unknown. S-palmitoylation of proteins is a reversible mechanism to modulate protein-protein and protein-membrane interactions, mainly by changing their affinity for membranes/lipid rafts/detergent resistant membranes (DRM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>. While many surface proteins have been described to be palmitoylated, this has not been investigated in the context of TNF-R1 signaling. For three other members of the TNF-receptor-superfamily (CD95, DR4 and DR6) palmitoylation has been reported. Intriguingly, palmitoylation of CD95 and DR4 is required for lipid raft localization and cell death signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, palmitoylation of DR6 prevents association with lipid rafts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>Three groups reported that TNF-R1:lipid raft association is essential for ERK and NF-κB regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, suggesting a possible involvement of palmitoylation. Other groups reported TNF-R1 association and cell death induction with caveolae-like structures, which represent a subgroup of lipid rafts/DRM <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. In addition, D' Alessio and colleagues showed that TNF-R1 shedding by TACE is also dependent on lipid raft microdomains <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, which may also regulate the recently described subsequent TNF-R1 intramembrane ripping by γ-secretase <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Also, changes in the lipid raft proteome in response to TNF point towards a role of palmitoylation of regulatory elements in this phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>. However, the role of lipid rafts for TNF-R1 signaling is not fully understood and may depend on the cell type investigated. In contrast to the HT1080 cell line <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, TNF-R1-induced apoptosis has been reported to depend on lipid rafts in the U937 myeloid cell line <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. In primary mouse macrophages, lipid rafts/caveolae appear to be important for transducing TNF-R1 signaling to the MAPK/ERK pathway but not to NF-κB activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. A selective lipid raft dependency of TNF-R1 signaling to p42 MAPK/ERK was observed in primary mouse macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, but in human airway smooth muscle cells NF-κB and MAPK activation by TNF was found to be independent of lipid rafts <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. In the human endothelial cell line EA.hy926, TNF-R1-mediated activation of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3K), but not of NF-κB, seems to originate from caveolae after interaction of TNF-R1 with caveolin-1. From these caveolae, TNF-R1 can also be internalized in a clathrin independent manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. By contrast, disruption of lipid rafts in HT1080 fibrosarcoma blocked NF-κB activation and sensitized cells to apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Ali and colleagues recently showed that TNF mediated necrosome formation occurs in caveolin-1-containing DRM <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. We recently identified the anti-epilepsy drug Phenhydan® as potent inhibitor of both, TNF-R1 mediated NF-κB and cell death signaling by influencing lipid raft formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Thus, redistribution of TNF-R1 into DRM/lipid rafts and nonraft regions of the membranes seems to regulate the diversity of signaling responses by TNF in various cell types, but the quality of signals transduced from lipid rafts varies significantly between different cell lines.</p><p>We identified constitutive palmitoylation of TNF-R1 but the number, exact sites and which PAT are involved is still unclear and has to be unraveled in further studies. In an acylRAC proteome analysis of TNF-R1 CRISPR/ Cas9 edited cells, which is part of a different project, we identified one TNF-R1 peptide (data not shown). Analysis of acylRAC samples by MS in this study did not result in identification of TNF-R1 peptides. The low coverage of peptides identified by mass spectrometry is in line with two earlier reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>, as well as with our own unpublished proteomic analyses of TNF-receptosomes, suggesting that it is challenging to detect TNF-R1 by MS. As an attempt to directly show palmitoylation of TNF-R1 by MS, TNF-R1 IP was performed followed by MS analysis selectively searching for TNF-R1 peptides with and without putative + 238,22 Da mass shift by palmitoylation. Despite a TNF-R1 sequence coverage of 39%, detection of peptides containing any of the intracellular cysteines was lacking (data not shown).</p><p>Mutagenesis of the putative palmitoylation site C248 led to high overall cellular TNF-R1 expression but reduced TNF-R1 surface expression. IκB degradation was blocked in C248S cells. Compared to TNF-R1 knock-out cells cell death was restored but on a lower level. We assume that C248 palmitoylation is required for Golgi to PM transport, which is in line with the report by Wang et al., showing that surface TNF-R1 is shed from the cell surface in response to histamine and subsequently replenished by TNF-R1 from an intracellular Golgi pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This is supported by our observation that upon PM-depletion of TNF-R1 by histamine, palmitoylation of the receptor was validated by metabolic labeling with 17-ODYA. In 2009, Rossin et al. claimed that DR4 but not TNF-R1 and DR5 are palmitoylated, using metabolic labeling with radioactive palmitate <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. In this study TNF-R1 was probably not detected due to the unfitting timeframe for metabolic labeling or due to the fact that only a fraction of all cellular TNF-R1 is palmitoylated at a time.</p><p>Altered subcellular distribution of TNF-R1 may also result in reduced glycosylation/sialylation of TNF-R1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. This could explain the different band patterns observed by acylRAC/WB obtained from wt and C248S cells. Han and colleagues showed that lacking TNF-R1 N-glycosylation reduced TNF binding to TNF-R1 diminishing downstream signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Holdbrooks and colleagues reported that α2-6 sialylation of TNF-R1 inhibits TNF-induced TNF-R1 internalization and apoptosis induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Lacking sialylation could result in enhanced basal TNF-R1 internalization, which could also explain the reduced surface expression, that we observed in cells carrying a mutation in the C248 palmitoylation site in TNF-R1.</p><p>We found that APT2 is involved in TNF-R1 de-palmitoylation which may be prerequisite for lipid raft translocation and NF-κB activation as reported by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. This would be in line with our recent report, showing that interfering with membrane composition using Phenhydan®, also blocks NF-kB activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Pharmacological APT2 inhibition resulted in reduced internalization while lowering the inhibitor concentration reversed this effect. This might be explained by the effect that other PTE like APT1 are activated to compensate for APT2 function and/or APT2 has further roles in TNF-R1 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Unexpectedly, we observed an increase in apoptosis upon APT2 inhibition and shRNA mediated knock-down. We and others have shown that TNF-R1 activation induces pro-apoptotic ceramide production by plasma membrane resident nSMase <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Decreased TNF-R1 internalization by APT2 inhibition led to enhanced ceramide levels, which could be blocked by nSMase inhibition. Palmitoylation of nSMase-2 has been described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Moylan and colleagues showed that nSMase-3 can be activated by TNF in detergent resistant membranes, leading to ROS and ceramide production <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. TNF-R1 is linked to nSMase by EED, which in turn interacts with integrins <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Palmitoylation of Integrinα6 by zDHHC3 has been described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>In glioma cells, Integrinα6β1 prevents TNF induced apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Palmitoylation of TNF-R1, nSMase and integrins might allow pre-assembly of these proteins in the same membrane compartment.</p><p>We also observed APT1:TNF-R1 interaction by co-IP, while the function of APT1 in the TNF-RSC remains to be investigated. The lysosomal PTE PPT1 has recently been linked to TNF signaling by showing that PPT1/ Cln-1 deficiency results in resistance to TNF induced apoptosis induction which is in line with our observations that TNF-receptosomes have to maturate into multivesicular bodies and lysosomes for full apoptosis induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. Interestingly, we observed higher PPT1 levels in acylRAC samples upon TNF stimulation. Direct PPT1:TNF-R1 interaction has not been observed.</p><p>Earlier reports showed that transmembrane TNF is palmitoylated which regulates its affinity to TNF-R1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.

We ruled out a possible role for endogenous TNF on TNF-R1 palmitoylation by co-culture with TNF targeting Fab.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Based on our results and reports from other groups, we propose the following model of de-palmitoylation events in the regulation of TNF-R1 signal transduction (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>):</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> Model. TNF-R1 is palmitoylated in the ER (PAT x ) or Golgi (PAT y ) and transported to caveolae in the plasma membrane. After TNF binding, TNF-R1 is either de-palmitoylated by APT2, resulting in translocation to another lipid raft compartment, complex I formation and signaling for NF-κB activation. Alternatively, TNF-R1 may translocate out of caveolae and TNF-receptosomes are formed by clathrin dependent internalization. This allows complex II/DISC formation by intracellular maturation. In case of APT2 depletion/inhibition, activated TNF-R1 induces nSMase dependent ceramide production in caveolae which triggers cell death TNF-R1 is palmitoylated in the Golgi to allow transport to distinct plasma membrane domains (i.e. caveolae). Activation of TNF-R1 requires TNF-R1 de-palmitoylation by APT2, allowing translocation to another lipid raft compartment and recruitment of the "complex I" proteins TRADD, RIP-1 and TRAF2, which is also palmitoylated in response to TNF. This induces NF-κB activation and cell survival. Capturing activated TNF-R1 in its steady state plasma membrane/caveolae localization after APT2 inhibition results in a strongly enhanced activation of nSMase and ceramide production, resulting in a shift to apoptosis. Internalization of TNF-R1 which may occur from both caveolae and unstructured plasma membrane is neither affected by C248S mutation nor APT2 down modulation.</p><p>In sum, our study demonstrates that palmitoylation represents a novel layer of regulation in TNF-R1 signaling.

Further in-depth characterization and understanding their role in TNF but also in TRAIL and FasL signal transduction may provide a means to interfere and modulate signaling on a new level and might provide access for pharmaceutical intervention for future disease treatment (i.e. chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 (</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 (See legend on next page.)</figDesc><graphic coords="5,127.28,94.85,340.76,444.70" type="bitmap" /></figure>
