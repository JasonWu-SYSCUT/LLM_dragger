			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Amyloid-beta (Aβ) is a key factor in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Selenium (Se) compounds show promise in AD treatment. Here, we revealed that selenoprotein K (SELENOK), a selenoprotein involved in immune regulation and potentially related to AD pathology, plays a critical role in microglial immune response, migration, and phagocytosis. In vivo and in vitro studies corroborated that SELENOK deficiency inhibits microglial Aβ phagocytosis, exacerbating cognitive deficits in 5xFAD mice, which are reversed by SELENOK overexpression. Mechanistically, SELENOK is involved in CD36 palmitoylation through DHHC6, regulating CD36 localization to microglial plasma membranes and thus impacting Aβ phagocytosis. CD36 palmitoylation was reduced in the brains of patients and mice with AD. Se supplementation promoted SELENOK expression and CD36 palmitoylation, enhancing microglial Aβ phagocytosis and mitigating AD progression. We have identified the regulatory mechanisms from Se-dependent selenoproteins to Aβ pathology, providing novel insights into potential therapeutic strategies involving Se and selenoproteins.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is neuropathologically characterized by extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Despite decades of thorough and extensive research, transformative breakthroughs in the prevention, attenuation, or reversal of AD progression have yet to be realized <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>. The intricate etiology of AD has challenged the precise definition of its pathogenesis, but several studies robustly support the central role of Aβ in triggering the pathological cascade. Therefore, strategies that focus on reducing Aβ production or facilitating its clearance continue to be at the forefront of research and are pivotal in evaluating potential AD therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Patients with AD and APOE4 allele carriers show reduced levels of selenium (Se), an essential trace element, indicating a significant correlation between Se levels and AD <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Therapeutic strategies harnessing Se-centric compounds have yielded promising results in decelerating Aβ and tau pathological progression, restoring synaptic deficits, and ameliorating cognitive impairments in AD models <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Additionally, our preliminary studies have unveiled the potential mechanistic contributions of Se in countering AD, notably through rectification of autophagic flux, mitochondrial impairments, and oxidative stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Nonetheless, the precise and direct targets of Se in the above effects remain unclear, especially the detailed mechanisms by which Se ameliorates Aβ pathology.</p><p>Selenoproteins are universally recognized as the primary biological vectors for Se intracellular activity, orchestrating diverse molecular pathways and physiological processes, including the protection of neurons from oxidative stress and ferroptosis via glutathione peroxidase 4, as well as in the regulation of protein folding and Ca 2+ homeostasis through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident selenoproteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The dysregulation of these selenoprotein-governed processes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Of the brain-enriched selenoproteins, a significant downregulation of selenoprotein K (SELENOK) is seen in the brains of patients and mice models with AD, which had been confirmed by cognitive deficits in SELENOK knockout mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Nevertheless, few studies have reported on the functional relationship between SELENOK and AD pathology.</p><p>Microglia, the intrinsic macrophages in the central nervous system, are pivotal in mounting immune responses in the brain. Early studies on genes associated with AD risk highlighted that nearly all of them are associated with microglial function and metabolism, including APOE4 and TREM2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Indeed, microglial activation is implicated in the early stages of AD, contributing to Aβ clearance and degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that Aβ-induced microglial pro-inflammatory activation also exacerbates AD pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Despite the contradictory outcomes of a plethora of studies on the role of microglia in the onset and progression of AD, there is a consensus that dysregulation of microglial functions is directly related to Aβ pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</p><p>SELENOK, localized to the ER membrane and highly expressed in immune cells, is required for the immune response, proliferation, and differentiation of various immune cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Recent in vitro research has shown that SELENOK overexpression markedly augments microglial migration and phagocytosis, indicating a probable impact on central nervous system immunity through microglial modulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. However, these findings remain to be corroborated in vivo. The current study aimed to elucidate the regulatory effects of SELENOK on microglial interactions with Aβ aggregates, to understand its implications on neuroimmune homeostasis, and to provide new insights into the role of Se in countering AD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Mice</head><p>Selenok -/-(SELK-KO) mice were generated and bred by Biocytogen (Beijing, China). Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 J mice used as background controls were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China). Cx3cr1Cre ERT2 (IMSR_JAX:021160) and 5xFAD mice (MMRRC_034848-JAX) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). AD-SELK-KO mice were generated by crossing 5xFAD mice with SELK-KO mice, and 5xFAD +/-/Cx3cr1Cre ERT2+/-mice generated by crossing 5xFAD mice with Cx3cr1Cre ERT2 mice. Mice were housed 5-6 per cage in a pathogen-free mouse facility with ad libitum access to food and water on a 12-h light/dark cycle. The male-to-female ratio was approximately 1:1, unless specified otherwise. Mice from different genotypes were cohoused and did not undergo any procedures prior to their stated use. All procedures were performed in compliance with guidelines approved by the Animal Ethical and Welfare Committee of Shenzhen University (Permit Number: IACUC-202300052).</p><p>Adenoviruses (AAVs) were packaged with SELENOK overexpression (SELK-OE) (AAV-MG1.2-SFFV-DIO-mScarlet-P2A-mSelenok [CDS+3′UTR]) and vehicle (AAV-MG1.2-SFFV-DIO-mScarlet) plasmids by Brain Case (Wuhan, China). The plasmids (rAAV/MG1.2 and pAAV-SFFV-DIO-mScarlet) were kindly provided by Dr. Rui Lin (National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing, China).</p><p>For AAV delivery into the cortex and hippocampus, 10-week-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Each site received 5 × 10 9 vg virus (1 μL at 5 × 10 12 vg/mL), targeting the right cortex and left hippocampus. The injection coordinates were as follows: cortex -1.0 mm posterior from the bregma, 2.5 mm lateral, 1.5 mm below the pia mater; hippocampus -2.0 mm posterior from the bregma, 1.3 mm lateral, 2.2 mm below the pia mater. Following virus administration, tamoxifen (100 mg/kg) (T5648; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Germany) was injected intraperitoneally for five consecutive days.</p><p>Intraperitoneal injection of Se supplementation in mice: solutions of selenomethionine (SeM; S3875; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck) and sodium selenite (SeNa; 71948; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck) were prepared in saline. Mice were injected with saline, SeM, or SeNa every two days for eight weeks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Cell culture, treatment, adenovirus, plasmids, and transfection</head><p>Human microglia cell line clone 3 (HMC3) cells (Fuheng Biology, Shanghai, China) were maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10 % FBS (Fuheng Biology). Primary glia cultures were prepared as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Briefly, mixed glial cultures, isolated from postnatal day 1-2 mice, were seeded in poly-L-lysine-coated flasks and cultured in DMEM with 10 % FBS. On day 3, the medium was replaced to include 25 ng/mL GM-CSF and 10 % FBS. Primary microglia were collected after 10-12 days and then every three days by shaking the flask for up to four harvests. Primary astrocytes were isolated after 10 days via overnight shaking to collect adherent cells from the bottom of the culture flask. Approximately 10 5 cells were plated into each well of a 6-well plate. Primary neurons were derived from the cortex and hippocampus of E15-17 embryos. The dissociated cells were cultured in neurobasal medium with 2 % B27, 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 50 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin on poly-L-lysine-coated 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 x 10 6 cells per well. Cultures were used after 12-15 days.</p><p>The AAVs employed in this study were engineered by Obio Technology (Shanghai, China). The shRNA construct for SELENOK knockdown (shSELK; GGTGGATGAGGAAGGTAAATG) and the control construct (TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT) were under control of the CMV promoter. The SELENOK overexpression virus comprised a CDS (285 bp) coupled with a 3′-UTR (595 bp) (NM_019979.2). For transfection, cells were plated in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere. The medium was then replaced with 750 μL serum-free medium. Full-length cDNAs for human CD36 and mutations in its palmitoylation sites were cloned into pcDNA3.1 with C-terminal Flag tags. These plasmids were generated by Obio Technology. Cell transfection commenced at 70-90 % confluency. The plasmid-transfection reagent mixture was prepared as per the manufacturer's instructions, mixed thoroughly, and allowed to stand at room temperature for 20 min. The mixture (500 μL) was gently added to each well, and the medium replaced 4 h later. Cells were evaluated for fluorescence the next day and were ready for further experiments 36 h post-transfection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Human subjects</head><p>Postmortem brain tissues were sourced from the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA, USA), with informed consent obtained from all subjects.

In brief, adult mice were euthanized and perfused with ice-cold PBS. The brains were rinsed, minced, and digested in DMEM/F12 (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing 1 mg/mL papain (P4762; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck), 1.2 U/mL dispase II (D4693; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck), 20 U/mL DNase I (D5025; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck), and 100 U/mL collagenase IV (17104019; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 • C for 30 min. The cell suspension was layered onto a 30 % Percoll (Solarbio, Beijing, China) gradient and centrifuged without rest at 300×g for 30 min at 18 • C. After centrifugation, cells were collected from the bottom layer of the Percoll gradient. After intensive washing, cells were separated using CD11b or ACSA-2 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). The isolated CD11b + adult microglia or ACSA-2 + adult astrocytes were then applied for further analysis.</p></div>

Cellular proteins (approximately 20 μg) were resolved on 10-15 % SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). The membrane was incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 • C, followed by a 1-h incubation at 37 • C with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (detailed in Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Epizyme, Shanghai, China) and visualized using an automatic chemiluminescence imaging system (Tanon, Shanghai, China).

Brain sections (25 μm thickness) were prepared using a sliding microtome and preserved at -20 • C in a cryoprotectant solution. For immunostaining, both brain sections and cultured cells were washed thrice with PBS and blocked for 30 min at room temperature in a solution containing 0.5 % Triton X-100 and 10 % normal goat serum. The samples were then incubated overnight at 4 • C with primary antibodies (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>) in the blocking buffer. Next, the samples were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies in a blocking buffer for 1 h. After washing, the samples were counterstained with DAPI. Imaging was performed using a ZEISS LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Germany), using z-stack and tile scan features. Acquired images were processed for orthogonal projection or subjected to colocalization channel construction and threedimensional (3D) reconstruction using Imaris 9.0.1 software (Bitplane, Switzerland).</p></div>

Ouyang et al.</p><p>SELK-KO mice were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A-C</ref>. Longitudinal ELISA assessments of inflammatory cytokines (pro-inflammatory factors: IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α; anti-inflammatory factors: IL-10 and IL-4) revealed no significant changes in the brains of WT and SELK-KO mice at two and six months of age (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). However, at 10 months, a significant decrease was observed in the cortical levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10, as well as the hippocampal levels of IL-6 and TNFα (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>).</p><p>Glial cells are a predominant source of brain inflammatory cytokines. Hence, we isolated microglia and astrocytes from adult mouse brains using magnetic bead antibodies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>). A notable downregulation in IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 transcription was detected in SELK-KO microglia relative to their WT counterparts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>), aligning with the brain inflammatory cytokine profiles. In contrast, the levels of these cytokines in astrocytes of WT and SELK-KO mice showed no significant differences (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>), implicating microglia as the primary locus of cytokine dysregulation in the SELK-KO mouse brain.</p><p>Next, we constructed shSELK primary microglia using adenoviral vectors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1I</ref>). The shSELK microglia had substantially reduced IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 mRNA levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1J</ref>). Similarly, the knockdown of SELENOK in HMC3 cells (Figs. <ref type="figure">S2A-C</ref>) resulted in a significant decrease in the expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2D</ref>). These results suggest that the reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels caused by SELK-KO or shSELK may affect microglial activation. To further test the immune response of microglia to extracellular stimuli, we treated them with LPS. Following LPS treatment, both primary microglia and HMC3 cells exhibited a significant increase in inflammatory cytokine expression (Figs. <ref type="figure">S2E-F</ref>). However, in shSELK primary microglia and HMC3 cells, these levels were significantly lower than those in the controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1K</ref> and<ref type="figure">S2G</ref>), a result indicative of dampened immune activation by microglia due to a SELENOK deficit. Subsequent reexpression of SELENOK (SELK-RE) in SELK-KO primary microglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1L</ref>) led to a significant increase in IL-1β and TNF-α levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1M</ref>). However, SELK-OE in HMC3 cells (Figs. <ref type="figure">S2F-H</ref>) did not increase the cytokine expression levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1N</ref>). These findings suggest that SELE-NOK expression helps maintain microglial immune homeostasis.</p></div>

Alterations in SELENOK levels in HMC3 cells did not affect cell proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3A</ref>). Consistent with these in vitro findings, no significant differences were observed in the levels of IBA1 + microglia (an immunohistochemical marker for both ramified and activated microglia) in vivo between 10-month-old mice in the SELK-KO and WT groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3B</ref>). Moreover, flow cytometric analysis of the CD11b + /CD45 low microglial subset within brain single-cell suspensions indicated no substantial variance in microglial proportions between the two groups (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>), further suggesting the non-involvement of SELE-NOK in regulating microglial proliferation and density.</p><p>Microglial activation is involved in the regulation of its functionality, and SELENOK deficiency is linked to compromised microglial activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Although SELENOK has been reported to modulate BV2 cell migration and phagocytosis in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, a de novo evaluation of its effects on microglial functions in vivo is warranted. Microglial migration, a prerequisite for efficacious immune surveillance and response, was examined using a transwell migration assay. SELK-KO primary microglia exhibited significantly reduced migration compared to that of WT cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3C</ref>). In HMC3 cells, shSELK further corroborated this migratory impairment (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A-B</ref>), indicating that a deficiency in SELENOK expression impairs microglial migration. Microglial immunity mainly relies on their phagocytic activity. CD68 is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein whose levels are upregulated in actively phagocytosing microglia and monocytes, serving as a marker of microglial phagocytic activity in microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>. CD68 colocalization in the brain microglia of 10-month-old SELK-KO mice was reduced based on immunofluorescence combined with 3D reconstruction (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>) and quantitative western blotting analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). Similarly, in both primary microglia and HMC3 cells in vitro, CD68 expression was significantly reduced in shSELK microglia, as detected by immunofluorescence and western blotting analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">2E</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4C-E</ref>).</p><p>To characterize microglial phagocytosis more directly, fluorescent microspheres (1 μm diameter) were co-incubated with microglia and cultured for 3 h. Flow cytometric analysis showed that shSELK significantly reduced microsphere fluorescence within both primary microglia and HMC3 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2F</ref> and S4F-G); and in shSELK HMC3 cells, the proportion of cells capable of phagocytosing microspheres was also significantly reduced (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4H-I</ref>). Conversely, SELK-RE in SELK-KO primary microglia significantly augmented CD68 expression and phagocytic capacity (Fig. <ref type="figure">2G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). Importantly, astrocytic phagocytosis appeared unaffected by SELENOK manipulation, highlighting a microglia-specific regulatory role of SELENOK in the brain (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3D-F</ref>).</p><p>To further understand the role of SELENOK in microglial function, adult mouse microglia RNA was sequenced. RNA-seq analysis revealed that 317 genes were differentially expressed in SELK-KO microglia compared to that in the WT group: 203 upregulated and 114 downregulated (|log2(FC)| &gt; 1 and p &lt; 0.05) (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5A-B</ref>). Clustering analysis underscored distinct expression patterns in the two groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5C</ref>). GO-biological process analysis revealed that the downregulated genes notably enriched pathways linked to immune cell migration (Fig. <ref type="figure">2I</ref>). The GSEA indicated significant enrichment of these genes in negative regulatory pathways of immune response and lysosomal degradation (Fig. <ref type="figure">2J</ref>), highlighting the impact of SELK-KO on microglial activation, migration, and phagocytosis. However, the scattered distribution of these differential genes across the GO and KEGG pathways suggests that the RNA-seq data, while informative, falls short in pinpointing clear molecular targets or mechanisms underlying the effects of SELENOK on microglia.</p><p>Disease-associated microglia (DAM), a subtype of microglia identified via single-cell RNA-seq, is pivotal in Aβ phagocytosis and AD pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.

We further analyzed the RNA-seq data based on FPKM values, leading to the identification of a comprehensive differential gene expression profile in SELK-KO microglia (p &lt; 0.01). A comparison of gene expression profiles between SELK-KO microglia and DAM intriguingly revealed a downregulation in most key genes facilitating this transition in SELK-KO microglia (Fig. <ref type="figure">2K</ref>). This deviation from the DAM phenotype in SELK-KO microglia leads to speculation of the critical role that SELENOK-induced microglial dysfunction plays in the process of Aβ phagocytosis and deposition in AD. In addition, the observed alterations in expression of these homeostatic genes, including Csf1r, Hexb, Olfml3, and Ctss, further corroborate that the knockout of SELENOK induces a disruption in the fundamental immune functions of microglia.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">SELENOK promotes microglial phagocytosis and clearance of Aβ</head><p>The above data confirmed that SELENOK significantly regulates microglial function, suggesting a potential impact on microglial Aβ phagocytosis. Primary microglia co-incubated with fluorescent-labeled Aβ 42 oligomers (FAM-Aβ 42 ) showed significantly reduced FAM-Aβ 42 phagocytosis in shSELK cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A</ref>), as corroborated through flow cytometry quantification, which showed reduced Aβ fluorescence following SELK-KO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3B</ref>). Similarly, shSELK HMC3 cells displayed reduced FAM-Aβ 42 uptake (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6A-B</ref>). Conversely, SELK-RE in SELK-KO primary microglia significantly increased FAM-Aβ 42 phagocytosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>), which was also observed in SELK-OE HMC3 cells when compared to that in the controls (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6C-D</ref>). Notably, SELK-KO did not affect FAM-Aβ 42 phagocytosis in primary astrocytes (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6E-F</ref>), indicating a microglia-specific role.</p><p>Aβ phagocytosed by microglia is transported to lysosomes for degradation and clearance. Following post-Aβ 42 oligomer co-incubation, Aβ degradation was further assessed in primary microglia in the presence and absence of lysosomal enzyme inhibitors (pepstatin A, leupeptin, and E-64d) and chloroquine. Cell-associated Aβ 42 levels were significantly lower in shSELK microglia exposed to lysosomal inhibitors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3E</ref>), but no notable changes were observed without inhibitor treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3E</ref>). Calculation of the Aβ degradation rate (subtracting Aβ 42 levels in the absence of inhibitors from that in the presence of inhibitors) revealed a significant reduction in Aβ 42 degradation in shSELK microglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3F</ref>). In SELK-KO microglia, SELK-RE following chloroquine treatment significantly increased cell-associated Aβ 42 levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3G</ref>), and Aβ degradation was significantly enhanced in SELK-RE microglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3H</ref>). This suggests that SELENOK also affects microglial Aβ degradation.</p><p>To further confirm the impact of SELENOK on the microglial phagocytosis of neuronal Aβ (derived from human APP transgenes), primary neurons from AD-transgenic mice (5xFAD) were co-cultured with WT (CNM), and SELK-KO (KNM) primary microglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3I</ref> and<ref type="figure">J</ref>). In this co-culture system, Aβ levels in the medium primarily depended on its production by AD neurons and phagocytosis by microglia. The Aβ production pathway analysis showed no differences in cleavage enzymes (ADAM10 and BACE1) or their products (sAPPα and sAPPβ) in the CNM and KNM co-cultures (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3K-L</ref>), indicating comparable Aβ production. Compared to those in AD neurons cultured alone (N), the CNM co-cultures showed significantly lower Aβ 42 levels in the medium, indicative of the microglial phagocytosis ability of microglia in the coculture system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3M</ref>). Interestingly, compared to those of CNM, the KNM co-culture had significantly higher Aβ 42 levels in the medium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3M</ref>), suggesting that SELK-KO markedly inhibits microglial phagocytosis of neuronal Aβ.</p></div>

Analysis of Aβ production pathways in mouse brains post-SELK-KO showed no significant changes in the levels of APP, ADAM10, BACE1, sAPPα, and sAPPβ (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7B-C</ref>). Similar results were obtained from in vitro studies with AD primary neurons (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7B-D</ref>). ELISA analysis further confirmed stable neuronal Aβ levels following SELK-KO (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7E</ref>), indicating that SELENOK likely does not affect neuronal Aβ production. Additionally, quantitative PCR of key Aβdegrading enzymes (insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin, endothelinconverting enzyme 1, and matrix metalloproteinase 2) in the mouse brain showed no significant alterations between the two groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7F</ref>). These findings collectively suggest that the elevated Aβ levels in AD-SELK-KO mouse brains are primarily attributed to reduced microglial Aβ phagocytosis caused by SELK-KO.</p></div>

Moreover, microglial CD36 transcription showed no significant differences between controls and SELK-KO or shSELK cells (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S8C-D</ref>), indicating that SELENOK regulates the post-translational modification, namely palmitoylation, of CD36 in microglia.</p><p>Studies by Hoffmann et al. have shown that SELENOK interacts with the ER-located palmitoyltransferase, DHHC6, enhancing its catalytic efficiency in palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.

However, overexpression of SELENOK in shDHHC6 cells no longer affected CD36 palmitoylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>), indicating that SELENOK affects CD36 palmitoylation via DHHC6. Conversely, overexpressing DHHC6 in microglia naturally increased CD36 palmitoylation, which was significantly reduced in response to shSELK (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S8E-F</ref>). These findings demonstrate that the efficacy of the palmitoylation system, given adequate DHHC6 expression, is predominantly reliant on SELENOK.</p><p>Given the impact of SELENOK on CD36 palmitoylation in microglia, we next explored its involvement in microglial Aβ phagocytosis. Based on reported palmitoylation sites in CD36 (Cys3, Cys7, Cys464, and Cys466), we overexpressed WT CD36 and a palmitoylation site mutant (C3S, C7S, C464S, and C466S) (SSSS) in HMC3 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">S9A</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">SELENOK facilitates CD36 localization to microglial plasma membranes through palmitoylation regulation</head><p>CD36 palmitoylation has been linked to microglial functions and Aβ phagocytosis. Yet, further understanding of how this palmitoylation influences microglial Aβ phagocytosis remains essential to fully elucidate the regulatory role of SELENOK in microglia. Palmitoylation typically governs protein transport and membrane localization and plays a pivotal role in CD36 functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>. Previous studies indicate that palmitoylation assists CD36 in localizing within the cellular membrane system, facilitating its transport to the cell membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Evidently, CD36 localization in the microglial membrane is crucial for it to recognize and bind Aβ, thus enhancing microglial phagocytosis and Aβ degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Therefore, the impact of CD36 palmitoylation on its localization and expression on the microglial surface was further confirmed. Compared to that in WT cells, SSSS cells had significantly lower CD36 expression in the cell membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Additionally, either knocking down or overexpressing DHHC6 in WT cells significantly lowered or raised microglial surface CD36 expression, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>), indicating the direct role of CD36 palmitoylation in its membrane surface presence.</p><p>Further analysis focused on the effect of SELENOK on CD36 expression in microglial membranes. Flow cytometric analysis of singlecell suspensions from adult mouse brains revealed notably lower CD36 levels in SELK-KO microglial membranes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7D</ref>). Similarly, in WT primary microglia, SELENOK levels corresponded directly with the CD36 membrane expression levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). Additionally, a significant decrease in surface CD36 expression was observed in cultured SELK-KO primary microglia compared to that in the WT counterparts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). These findings, both in vivo and in vitro, highlight the pivotal role that SELENOK plays in modulating CD36 expression in microglial membranes and, consequently, microglial Aβ phagocytosis. Changes in SELENOK expression affected CD36 membrane expression in WT but not in SSSS models of HMC3 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7I-K</ref>), demonstrating that its regulatory effect on microglial membrane CD36 levels is dependent on CD36 palmitoylation.</p></div>

Theoretically, this suggests that pathological changes associated with a SELENOK deficit, such as reduced CD36 palmitoylation (seen in SELK-KO microglia), might also occur in AD. Confirming this hypothesis, 5xFAD mouse brains showed significantly reduced levels of SELENOK and CD36 palmitoylation and increased levels of total CD36, but no discernible changes in DHHC6 levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8A</ref>). Flow cytometry of adult mouse brain microglia also indicated a significant decrease in CD36 levels in AD microglial membranes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8B</ref>). Importantly, similar findings were observed in human AD brains, with decreased SELENOK expression and CD36 palmitoylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). These results suggest that impaired CD36 palmitoylation, leading to reduced microglial Aβ phagocytosis, is involved in AD progression. Enhancing CD36 palmitoylation could, therefore, potentially augment microglial Aβ phagocytosis, identifying a key mechanism by which SELK-OE could mitigate AD.</p><p>A key aim in studying the relationship between SELENOK and AD is to explore the systemic mechanisms underlying Se-mediated prevention of AD. Therefore, we next explored whether SELENOK-mediated CD36 palmitoylation, which affects microglial Aβ phagocytosis, is a crucial mechanism in the anti-AD effects of Se. In vitro, treatment of primary microglia with SeM and SeNa significantly elevated SELENOK levels and promoted CD36 palmitoylation without altering CD36 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). Further functional assays showed that Se supplementation significantly increased microglial membrane CD36 levels and its Aβ phagocytosis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>), indicating that Se potentially boosts microglial Aβ phagocytosis via the CD36 palmitoylation pathway.</p><p>In vivo experiments involving an 8-week intraperitoneal injection of SeM and SeNa in 5xFAD mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8I</ref>) resulted in a significant upregulation of SELENOK expression in mouse brains (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8J</ref>). A notable reduction was observed in Aβ plaque counts in the hippocampus and cortex of these mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8K</ref>). Moreover, both Se compounds significantly increased CD36 palmitoylation in mouse brains without affecting total CD36 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8L-M</ref>). Additionally, SeM and SeNa markedly increased the number of Aβ plaques associated with microglia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8N</ref>), suggesting that Se supplementation enhances microglial Aβ phagocytosis in AD mouse brains. Therefore, our study substantiates that SELENOK-mediated microglial functions are pivotal mechanisms in the anti-AD effects of Se.</p></div>

However, the exact role of SELENOK in modulating brain immunity remains unclear. This study elucidated that SELENOK deficiency in the brain compromises microglial immune functions, such as migration and phagocytosis, while significantly lowering inflammatory cytokine levels.

Therefore, this study provides insights into the role of Se in brain immunity from the perspective of selenoproteins. Emerging research indicates the pivotal involvement of dysfunctional microglia in mediating neuroinflammation, a key factor in various central nervous system disorders and neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. This includes the involvement of microglial phagocytosis of pathological proteins, such as synuclein in Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Consequently, our results contribute to and substantiates, to a certain extent, the understanding of the therapeutic potential of Se in addressing neuroinflammatory-related diseases.</p><p>Numerous genes associated with AD risk are closely associated with microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>, suggesting that the function of SELENOK in brain immune regulation may also be crucial in the pathology of AD. The advancement in single-cell genomics has brought DAM, identified in AD  brains, into the spotlight of AD and microglia research <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>. DAM, known for its active phagocytosis of Aβ plaques, plays a key role in mitigating AD pathology. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that drive the transformation of homeostatic microglia into DAM has become a crucial aspect of AD research and therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref>. Transcriptome analysis of adult mouse microglia revealed that SELK-KO microglia and DAM exhibit distinctly divergent transcriptional profiles compared to that of homeostatic microglia, implying that microglial SELENOK deficiency hampers the transition to a DAM phenotype. This hypothesis is further substantiated by a series of Aβ phagocytosis experiments. In vivo investigations confirmed that changes in microglial SELENOK expression directly affect their Aβ phagocytosis and cognitive impairment in AD mice, emphasizing the regulation of SELENOK in AD progression. Importantly, while we had used SELK-KO 5xFAD mice (not microglial SELK-KO mice), comprehensive analyses across various Aβ production and degradation pathways demonstrated that SELENOK affects AD pathology predominantly through the regulation of microglial Aβ phagocytosis.</p><p>In mechanistic exploration, the initial analyses of transcriptomic data fell short of yielding anticipated insights. As a result, we steered towards a thorough review and analysis of the biological implications of SELENOK. A critical aspect that we examined was the effects of SELE-NOK on intracellular Ca 2+ flux. SELENOK deficiency, mediated via IP3R-associated ER Ca 2+ stores, leads to an overload of intracellular Ca 2+ , a state typically associated with cellular stress responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>. This poses an apparent contradiction to the diminished microglial immune response observed in SELENOK-deficient conditions, suggesting the existence of other pivotal mechanisms that influence microglial function. Moreover, the most extensively reported SELENOK-related mechanism, centered on ER stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75]</ref>, appears to have a less direct association with its effects on microglia. We, therefore, redirected our focus to studying the impact of SELENOK on microglial functions and Aβ phagocytosis. Our findings suggest that SELENOK depletion diminishes microglial immune responses, potentially due to impaired innate immunity mediated by pattern recognition receptors, which are crucial for the recognition and binding necessary for Aβ phagocytosis by microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>. Among these receptors, we unexpectedly discovered a close relationship between CD36 and SELENOK. SELENOK-dependent CD36 palmitoylation in macrophages significantly influences CD36 stability. This interplay places CD36 at a juncture directly connected with the functionality of SELENOK and microglial Aβ phagocytosis, positioning it as a strategic target for mechanistic exploration.</p><p>In this study, we systematically unveiled a comprehensive mechanism whereby SELENOK regulates CD36 palmitoylation through DHHC6, mediating its expression on the microglial plasma membrane and consequently affecting the microglial phagocytosis of Aβ. Notably, we discerned the specificity of the impact SELENOK has on CD36 in microglia. SELENOK/DHHC6 palmitoylates CD36 to regulate its membrane localization without altering total CD36 expression in microglia. This is also a key aspect of how palmitoylation modification affects protein function <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>. As an ER-resident selenoprotein, Hoffmann et al. have extensively reported the interaction of SELENOK with DHHC6 and their joint effect on the palmitoylation of target proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. However, detailed effects of SELENOK/DHHC6-palmitoylated CD36 on its subsequent localization on the microglial plasma membrane were not addressed in this study. Existing data indicates that proteins are sequentially palmitoylated in the ER and Golgi apparatus before reaching the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. In addition to DHHC6, other DHHC enzymes, such as DHHC4 in the Golgi and DHHC5 on the plasma membrane, also contribute to CD36 palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78]</ref>. Therefore, CD36 trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane is orchestrated by a cascade of DHHC enzymes, with DHHC6 potentially directly influencing its transport to the Golgi. Recent studies exploring the effect of SELENOK on CD36 transport in hepatocytes have affirmed this process <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>A significant elevation in CD36 expression has been reported in brains with Aβ deposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79]</ref>, along with the identification of a high CD36-expressing microglial subtype <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Additionally, numerous studies report that increased CD36 expression or recycling significantly enhances the Aβ phagocytosis and degradation of microglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">81]</ref>. These findings underscore the crucial role of CD36 in the functionality of microglia within Aβ pathology. However, to date, there have been no reports on the changes in CD36 palmitoylation within AD microglia or its role in the progression of AD. Our investigations in patients and mouse models with AD have identified a marked reduction in CD36 palmitoylation as a notable pathological change during AD development. Although SELENOK levels are also markedly reduced in AD brains, current evidence does not conclusively establish it as the sole cause of diminished CD36 palmitoylation in AD. Nonetheless, we demonstrated that increasing SELENOK levels in the brain can promote CD36 palmitoylation and strengthen microglial Aβ phagocytosis, as confirmed by our subsequent in vivo and in vitro Se supplementation experiments. Consequently, these findings substantiate a profound mechanism where Se, dependent on SELENOK, regulates microglial functions to ameliorate AD. Given that the human body contains 25 selenoproteins, with seven located in the ER and five highly expressed in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>, it is challenging to link the effect of Se to a singular selenoprotein. Multiple selenoproteins may exert similar, synergistic, or antagonistic biological actions within cells. Hence, our study is a significant step forward, despite it not comprehensively elucidating the anti-AD mechanisms of Se. Nevertheless, it confirms that SELENOK is a critical target in the influence of Se on brain immunity and microglia in AD, providing new perspectives for the study of other selenoproteins in (A) Representative immunoblots and quantifications of CD36, DHHC6, and SELENOK protein expression, as well as CD36 palmitoylation levels, in hippocampal lysates from six-month-old wild-type (WT) and 5xFAD mice (n = 6 per group; 3 male and 3 female mice).
