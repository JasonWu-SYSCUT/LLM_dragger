<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Activation of the ab T cell receptor (TCR) is mediated by the CD3 complex and supported by CD4 or CD8 co-receptors that extracellularly bind to major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) or MHC-I, respectively, and form the ternary TCR-MHC-CD4/ CD8 complex (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Inside the T cell, signal transduction is initiated by Src-family kinases, such as Lck (lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase), which phosphorylates CD3 associated with a TCR complex. While co-receptors strongly enhance T cell responses that are potent amplifiers of signaling events, their mechanistic mode of action is still a matter of debate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> Lck interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the co-receptor, thereby approximating the ligand-bound TCR-CD3 complex to initiate the phosphorylation cascade. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> However, it has been shown that a pool of Lck freely diffusing within the membrane is also involved. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">9</ref> The two-stage co-receptor recruitment model suggests that the function of a co-receptor is modulated by TCR complex triggering, but not the other way around. The TCR complex is initially and partially phosphorylated by free Lck, followed by the recruitment of the co-receptor-Lck complex to the TCR-MHC complex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> Interestingly, even though CD4 and CD8 co-receptors deliver Lck to the TCR complex, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> the effect of CD4 on the affinity and half-life of the TCR-MHC II complex was shown to be negligible. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> CD4-MHC II interaction is orders of magnitude weaker than typical T cell/APC (antigen-pre-senting cell) peptide interactions, suggesting that MHC has a very poor ability to recruit co-receptors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> However, it was recently shown that CD4 is able to enhance TCR sensitivity via enormous synergy and cooperation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Accumulating data about independent signal transduction by CD4/CD8-Lck complexes resulted in the identification of a 32-amino-acid-long N-terminal domain of Lck, which is necessary and sufficient to interact with the 38-amino-acid-long C-terminal tail of CD4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Within the domains, four cysteine residues were found critical, together with a zinc ion (Zn 2+ ) that links the CD4 and Lck units. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> Structural investigations of Zn(CD4/CD8)(Lck) complexes showed that Zn 2+ is bound with micromolar affinity in a tetrahedral geometry within a compact fold called zinc clasp (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> However, further competition studies demonstrated much higher, subnanomolar Zn 2+ affinity to CD4 that matches well free Zn 2+ concentration (([Zn 2+ ] free ) fluctuations occurring in the cell, suggesting that zinc clasp assembly might be regulated in a Zn 2+ -dependent manner. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> Nevertheless, Zn 2+ contribution to CD4-Lck binding has been confirmed in a test tube; its in vitro influence on CD4-Lck occupancy is still missing.

Three different approaches were undertaken: (i) in-solution studies using model peptides, (ii) membrane reconstitution of zinc clasp assembly, and (iii) T cell studies with overexpression of CD4 and Lck where intracellular free Zn 2+ availability was controlled. Experiments using artificial membranes and a model cell line showed that cellular Zn 2+ fluctuations can induce zinc clasp assembly, thus making intracellular free Zn 2+ concentrations a limiting factor. Moreover, our study demonstrated that the palmitoylation of CD4 affects Zn(CD4)(Lck) complex formation and confirmed the physiological relevance of Zn 2+ in the plasma membrane status of CD4. Our data open new directions to the understanding of mechanistic details of TCR activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reconstitution of Zn 2+ -dependent interaction of CD4 and Lck</head><p>Previous reports showed that the in-solution formation of the zinc clasp assembly occurs at a subnanomolar range of buffered free Zn 2+ concentration indicating high stability of the heterodimer (Zn(CD4)(Lck)). A similar approach showed that homodimerization of the CD4 cytoplasmic tail occurs at a higher free Zn 2+ concentration, showing that such a complex is significantly less stable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> To examine how [Zn 2+ ] free -controlled conditions contribute to zinc clasp assembly in the presence of a membrane, the interaction was reconstituted using artificial lipid bilayers. Inorganic zinc competitors provided buffering at its free concentration from 10 À14 to 10 À9 M (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>, supplemental information). The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of CD4 (CD4ct) and the N-terminal unique domain of Lck (Lck-UD) were myristylated to provide their docking (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Fluorescent modifications at their C terminus were introduced to track the assembly via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) phenomena (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). These modifications enabled myrCD4ct(FAM) and myrLck-UD(TAMRA) to be embedded in large (LUVs) and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Instantaneous docking of protein domains in the lipid bilayer was confirmed with flotation experiments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). Both systems differ in size, membranous properties, and handling. Application of LUVs made it possible to maintain surface density of CD4ct and Lck-UD in the membrane at 415 and 7412 molecules per mm 2 , where the former is the reference value for Lck. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> presents FAM fluorescence changes in both conditions at different [Zn 2+ ] free values. No differences in fluorescence at 520 nm between myrCD4ct(FAM) alone or together with myrLck-UD(TAMRA) are detected for samples with a surface density of 415 molecules/mm 2 . However, for both CD4ct(FAM) alone or together with Lck-UD(TAMRA), a decrease in the fluorescence with increasing [Zn 2+ ] free , starting at 10 À13 M, was observed. For a higher surface density (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>), differences are observed between donor and donor-acceptor, and it is clearly seen that the fluorescence emission pattern in the applied free Zn 2+ concentration range is significantly different from the density of 415 molecules per mm 2 .</p><p>Due to the drawbacks of LUV methodology, a GUV membrane model was established. The major advantage is that it better resembles the cell membrane dimensions and enables one to track single liposomes under the confocal microscope. In order to observe zinc clasp formation, single GUVs that indicated the presence of both CD4ct(FAM) and Lck-UD(TAMRA) were imaged. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> shows representative GUVs of CD4ct(FAM) and CD4ct(FAM) with Lck(TAMRA) at the free Zn 2+ concentration of 10 À12 M, where FAM fluorescence lifetime is indicated. The results of zinc clasp reconstitution using GUVs at three different [Zn 2+ ] free values, 10 À9 , 10 À12 , and 10 À14 M, show that the FAM lifetime of donor-acceptor samples differed significantly from control samples (without added Zn 2+ ) in all investigated free Zn 2+ -buffered conditions. Besides the observed drop of FAM fluorescence lifetime, also a difference in CD4ct(FAM) samples between free Zn 2+ concentration of 10 À12 and 10 À9 M was observed. It may indicate that the Zn(CD4ct) 2 complex is formed in addition to the zinc clasp assembly at the nanomolar free Zn 2+ concentration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Palmitoylation weakens both zinc clasp assembly and CD4 dimerization</head><p>It has already been shown that the specificity of zinc clasp assembly in solution is affected by the length of CD4ct, where the sequential and structural elements play a stabilizing role. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> Although the zinc clasp heterocomplex is prevalent when CD4ct and Lck-UD are present in equimolar amounts, the availability of additional cysteinyl and histidyl CD4ct residues turned out to play a crucial role in both complex stoichiometry and CD4ct affinity for Zn 2+ . In the cell, membrane-proximal cysteine residues undergo reversible palmitoylation; thus, the influence of CD4 palmitoylation on Lck assembly was examined. At first, palmitoylated CD4ct(p) was compared with CD4ct in their Zn 2+ -and Lck-binding properties in solution (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Relative affinities of Zn 2+ to CD4ct, CD4ct(p), and their mixtures with Lck-UD were evaluated in the competition with the chromophoric chelating probe PAR. Upon the addition of a portion of the competitive peptide to the preformed Zn(PAR) 2 complex, a decrease in absorbance is detected due to the Zn 2+ transfer from the Zn(PAR) 2 complex to the peptide(s) of choice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Both CD4ct and CD4ct(p) competition curves show a substantial decrease. The transfer of Zn 2+ to CD4ct(p) occurs to a lower extent when compared with CD4ct, which indicates that palmitoylation weakens the interaction of Zn 2+ with CD4ct. (B) Reconstitution of CD4ct, CD4ct(p), and Lck-UD interactions in buffered free Zn 2+ concentration (dark blue dot) in the range of 10 À14 -10 À9 M maintained by zinc chelators (light blue half-moon) on the artificial membranes (yellow). Blurred yellow and pink circles represent FAM and TAMRA modifications, respectively. Model peptides were embedded in the membrane due to their myristylation (orange zigzag). (C) Scheme of T cell studies. CD4(Clover) was introduced to the Jurkat T cell line, and cells were selected to obtain the CD4 + cell line with stable overexpression of CD4(Clover). The CD4 + cell line was subjected to different intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free . The CD4 + cell line was transiently transfected with different Lck variants to observe the Zn 2+ -dependent CD4-Lck interaction studied by FRET.</p><p>A similar pattern was demonstrated in Zn(PAR) 2 competition with CD4ct and Lck-UD equimolar mixtures where less transfer was observed to CD4ct(p) and Lck-UD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the comparison of complexes of different stoichiometry is error prone and care should be taken in drawing conclusions. To verify the mode of Zn 2+ binding to CD4ct and its palmitoylated version, circular dichroism was used to monitor structural changes. CD spectra of CD4ct, CD4ct(p), and their equimolar mixtures with Lck-UD indicated random coils with subtle changes at 202 and 220 nm upon Zn 2+ addition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). Changes of ellipticity presented as a function of Zn 2+to-peptide molar ratio indicate a sharp inflection point at 1.0 for CD4ct, whereas CD4ct(p) shows a more flattened curve with the inflection point shifted toward 0.5. When CD4ct is in the equimolar mixture with Lck-UD, the heterodimerization is evident, but the transition from 0.5 to 1.0 Zn 2+ -to-peptide molar ratio is noticeable in the Zn 2+ titration curve. Palmitoylated CD4ct showed distinct behavior in the equimolar mixture with Lck-UD (ratio less than 0.5), suggesting that the assembly of a zinc clasp may not be completed in this condition. These results indicate that CD4ct forms complexes of distinct stoichiometry than CD4ct(p) with Zn 2+ , thus PAR competitions should be taken with care in concluding Zn 2+ -to-peptide(s) affinities in solution.</p><p>To evaluate differences in Zn 2+ -binding affinities, CD4ct and Lck-UD assembly was monitored in Zn 2+ -controlled media that maintain free Zn 2+ in the range of 10 À14 to 10 À10 M (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Fluorescently labeled (FAM)CD4ct, (FAM)CD4ct(p), and (TAMRA)Lck-UD were mixed equimolarly and FAM (donor) and TAMRA (acceptor) fluorescence intensities were registered. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> presents Zn 2+ -binding isotherms as the function of [Zn 2+ ] free . Readouts are presented as the normalized ratio of donor to acceptor fluorescence intensity. To compare binding affinities, we use logarithmic half-saturation values at which half of the complex forms, pZn 0.5 (equivalent to commonly used IC50). They were 12.7 ± 0.1 and 11.9 ± 0.1 for (FAM)CD4ct and (FAM) CD4ct(p) with (TAMRA)Lck-UD, respectively (Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). To further elucidate whether the buffered free Zn 2+ pool influences the formation of CD4ct and Lck-UD complexes in the membrane prox-imity, CD4ct(p) and Lck-UD interactions were reconstituted using the GUV lipid system. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref> presents the FAM fluorescence lifetime of myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) and myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) with myrLck-UD(TAMRA) that were embedded in the GUV membrane. At [Zn 2+ ] free of 10 À9 and 10 À12 M, GUV liposomes with palmitoylated myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) indicated similar fluorescence lifetime as the control sample with no Zn 2+ . Contrary to myrCD4ct(FAM), no drop of FAM fluorescence lifetime was observed for myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) at the free Zn 2+ concentration of 10 À9 M (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>). Moreover, when myrCD4ct(p)(FAM) was placed at the membrane surface together with myrLck-UD(TAMRA), the fluorescence lifetime did not decrease, in contrast to non-palmitoylated CD4ct. At 10 À9 and 10 À12 M of [Zn 2+ ] free , the significant increase of the fluorescence lifetime was observed for CD4(p)(FAM) which may result from increased rigidity in the membrane proximity.</p><p>CD4 plasma membrane status depends on intracellular free Zn 2+ concentration Since the reconstitution of CD4ct, Lck-UD, and Zn 2+ complexes on artificial membranes did show that both CD4ct and CD4ct with Lck-UD are sensitive to free Zn 2+ concentrations in the range of 10 À14 -10 À9 M, the CD4 plasma membrane presence was related to the intracellular free zinc in Jurkat cells as a model T cell line. Intracellular free zinc concentrations were modulated by adding or depleting extracellular zinc and determined with the fluorescent zinc probe FluoZin-3AM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> To achieve the lowest free intracellular Zn 2+ level, the novel approach of depleted media re-supplemented with a Zn 2+ metal buffer was introduced (supplemental information). Altogether, the intracellular free Zn 2+ concentrations varied from 10 À11 to 10 À9 M. At first, a CD4 + cell line with stable expression of CD4wt and the fluorescent reporter Clover was generated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>, supplemental information). Double-positive CD4 + cells with different intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free were analyzed in terms of intra-and extracellular fluorescence (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref> shows a histogram analysis of mean PE fluorescence (representing CD4 surface expression) in relation to the intracellular free Zn 2+ (A) Liposomal membranes based on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). myrCD4ct(FAM) (gray) and myrLck-UD (wine) are embedded in the membrane via myristylation at their N terminus (orange zigzag). Cysteinyl residues within peptide domains are presented as circles. Zn 2+ is schematically presented in blue. Fluorescent modifications at the C terminus are glowing circles. (B) Representative GUV images of CD4ct(FAM) and CD4ct(FAM) with Lck-UD(TAMRA) at [Zn 2+ ] free of 10 À12 M on the left and right, respectively, along with the FAM fluorescence average lifetime scale. Scalebars represent 10 mM. Below, there is FRET-FILM analysis of CD4ct(FAM) in gray and CD4ct(FAM) with Lck-UD(TAMRA) in blue embedded in the GUVs membrane and subjected to different [Zn 2+ ] free . Negative control of CD4ct(FAM) and Lck-UD(TAMRA) in chelexed 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KCl pH 7.4 without Zn 2+ is shown in orange. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with the Tukey test with p &lt; 0.05 and n = 4-5 using Origin software. Error bars represent the average of 4-5 different GUV images. Significant differences refer to the ''no Zn 2+ '' control unless shown with a dashed line. concentration where a significant rise of the zinc signal was observed between 0.1 and 0.7 nM. Whereas fluorescence of PE was increasing with increasing [Zn 2+ ] free , the analysis of Clover fluorescence (representing intracellular CD4) indicated different behavior.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Assembly of CD4 and Lck depends on the cellular Zn 2+ status</head><p>To investigate whether assembly of CD4 and Lck is dependent on Zn 2+ -binding cysteinyl residues, the CD4 + cell line was transiently transfected with plasmids that encode Lck with the red fluorescent reporter mRuby2 at the C terminus. Transient transfection was reported as a series of confocal microscope images 24-48 h after transfection (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>). In the study, wild-type protein Lck(wt), single and double alanine point mutants of Zn 2+binding cysteinyl residues Lck(1Ala) and Lck(12Ala), and the N-terminal unique domain responsible for CD4 binding via Zn 2+ Lck(UD) were used (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>). Complexity of the system rendered it impossible to apply media of controlled [Zn 2+ ] free since its measurement is impossible in CD4 + cell line expressing green fluorescent protein. To monitor the CD4-Lck interaction, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) measurements with the FRET setting were taken. CD4(Clover) and Lck(mRuby2) served as the FRET pair and the mean fluorescence of cells was recorded in three channels: donor, acceptor, and FRET. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref> shows the set of FACS density dot plots where the relationship of acceptor channel fluorescence (mRuby2) to donor channel fluorescence (Clover) was depicted. Quadrant gate analysis shows that CD4 + cells that were transiently transfected with the Lck(wt) plasmid are mostly found in the Q2 quadrant (CD4 + , Lck + ). In contrast, Jurkat T cells transfected with Lck (Lck + ) and non-transfected control (Jurkat) do not show fluorescence in the Q1 and Q2 quadrants of their dot plots.</p><p>For the FRET analysis, double-positive cells (Q2 quadrant) were taken and the ratio of mean fluorescence in the FRET channel to the mean fluorescence in the acceptor channel was determined. Mean fluorescence values were corrected for background fluorescence using Jurkat T cell samples as a control. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref> presents the results of FRET analysis of CD4 + cells transiently transfected with Lck(wt), Lck(12Ala), Lck(1Ala), Lck(UD), and mRuby2 as a control. A significant decrease of FRET was observed for both Lck mutants, Lck(12Ala) and Lck(1Ala), in comparison to Lck(wt). Lck(UD) also indicated a significant decrease of FRET in comparison to Lck(wt). To further examine the increase in FRET signal observed for Lck(wt), T cell receptor signaling was activated using CD3 and CD28 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7</ref>). Upon stimulation, FRET significantly increases in CD4 + cells transiently transfected with Lck(wt) but not in the other Lck variants compared to the control cell line. However, the decrease of FRET in Lck(12Ala) and Lck(1Ala)-transfected cells is noticeable. Altogether, the analyses indicate that the zinc clasp is formed in the CD4 + Lck + Jurkat T cells and that its formation is related to the availability of Zn 2+binding cysteinyl residues.</p><p>Equilibria simulation shows interdependence of Zn(CD4)(Lck) and Zn(CD4) 2 In order to probe whether or not [Zn 2+ ] free changes are able to alter the molar ratio between Zn(CD4)(Lck) and Zn(CD4) 2 species, equilibria simulations were performed based on the stability constants reported for peptide models (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7</ref>, supplemental information). <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> At first, CD4 and Lck concentrations were assumed to be 200 and 50 nM, respectively. Concentration of free Zn 2+ was set as variable in the range of 10 À7 -10 À15 M Figure 7A presents species distribution in the function of CD4 fraction where it is seen that free Zn 2+ change between 0.1 and 10 nM leads to substantial shift toward Zn(CD4) 2 formation whereas Zn(CD4)(Lck) remains at $25% up to low nanomolar free Zn 2+ (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S8-S10</ref>). Next, we aimed to variate CD4 concentrations between 0.05 and 25 mM. We performed simulations at 1 and 0.1 nM free Zn 2+ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7B</ref>). It is seen that Zn(CD4) 2 starts to dominate over zinc clasp above 0.5 and 5 mM CD4 for 1 and 1 nM free Zn 2+ , respectively. There is also noticeable difference in the rate of Zn(CD4) 2 changes whereas Zn(CD4)(Lck) is mostly unaffected. At the last set of simulations, we fixed CD4 and Lck at the constant molar ratio of 4 but their concentration was variated at 1 and 0.1 nM free Zn 2+ (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7C</ref>). Here, Zn(CD4)(Lck) also demonstrates constant behavior in contrary to Zn(CD4)2 that achieves $30% and $10% at 6 mM CD4 for 1 and 0.1 nM free Zn 2+ , respectively. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Due to Zn 2+ coordination by cysteinyl residues from both CD4ct and Lck-UD, there is a possibility to form complexes of composition distinct from Zn(CD4)(Lck). For example, it has been shown that minimal domains of both CD4ct 416-429 (14 aa) and Lck-UD 1,16-30 (16 aa) can homodimerize in the presence of Zn 2+ in solution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> Further studies indicated that CD4ct 396-431 binds Zn 2+ in 1:1 stoichiometry in solution whereas the C 397 A mutation leads to its Zn 2+ -dependent homodimerization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> Lck monomerizes with Zn 2+ very weakly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> thus its formation can be neglected in cellular conditions. However, in both cases, the zinc clasp heterodimer was formed predominantly.</p><p>Although the zinc clasp structure was solved 15 years ago and the participation of Zn 2+ in its formation is indisputable, it is still omitted in the considerations on formation of the CD4-Lck complex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> However, the importance of CD4 and Lck interaction into the process of T lymphocyte development and activation on the one hand, and the impact of Zn 2+ on the immune system on the other, has been thoroughly investigated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> The reason for such disregard may reside in the indirect proof of the complex's existence, where its disruption was observed upon treatment of cells with a membrane-permeable Zn 2+ chelator. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> One can imagine that such treatment may cause a range of cellular Zn 2+involved effects that in turn cause complex dissociation, which does not indicate per se that Zn 2+ certainly links CD4 and Lck in a cell. Another reason possibly lies in the technical difficulties of identifying metal-involved protein-protein complexes; thus, their transient character makes capturing them difficult. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> The zinc clasp complex differs from common structural zinc sites in proteins, where Zn 2+ is responsible either for polypeptide chain folding into special scaffolds (e.g., zinc fingers) or for stabilization of the whole protein or part of it. The Zn 2+ affinity in such sites is rather high or ultrahigh and reaches low picomolar or even femtomolar K d values, making them rather permanent under cellular conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> The interprotein metal-binding site occurring in the zinc clasp assembly is a different class of metal-binding sites where the assembly stability from an entropic point of view is less favored due to the presence of two or more protein subunits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Moreover, assembly formation is strictly regulated by the actual concentrations of all its constituents. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> From the cellular perspective, the gain of an additional factor to maintain a sufficient level of interfacial Zn 2+ complexes supports their regulatory role where assembly on demand is needed. Zinc clasp composition also raises the possibility of Zn 2+ binding by two of the same protein subunits. The selectivity of a particular Zn 2+ complex assembly is based mostly on the affinity of Zn 2+ binding to the proteins, which is supported by sequential and structural elements present within CD4 and Lck. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> Specificity of protein-protein interactions may be further elevated when cellular membranes are involved, phenomena observed in many cellular machineries carrying out their function. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> The involvement of distinct membrane platforms that trap or exclude proteins in induction or termination of signaling events thus has been established. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> It may further support different local protein abundances that are used to reach the specific threshold of signaling molecules. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> To check if/how the zinc clasp complex is influenced by the presence of the membrane, two frequently used lipid bilayer models have been applied to mimic the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. While the LUV model enables control of protein densities, GUVs mimic the cellular environment better regarding size, flexibility, and stiffness of the membrane. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref> The obtained results show that at the previously reported Lck surface density, there is no specificity in the formation of the zinc clasp assembly in all investigated buffered free Zn 2+ concentrations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> It supports the notion that CD4ct and Lck-UD domains need spatiotemporal orchestration, and the LUV model is not sufficient. Considering that the model is limited by the interferences from unbound protein domains, the GUV system was applied, where individual liposomes were chosen to examine the interaction. Changes in the fluorescence lifetime demonstrated successful zinc clasp com-plex reconstitution in all applied [Zn 2+ ] free values from 10 À14 to 10 À9 M. Nevertheless, both models with embedded CD4ct indicated the decrease of fluorescence (or fluorescence lifetime) with an increase of [Zn 2+ ] free . Although the peptide model of CD4ct binds Zn 2+ in 1:1 stoichiometry in solution, the intramolecular complex is formed by cysteine residues beyond these that bind Lck in heterocomplex. In the cell, these cysteine residues are placed near the membrane; thus, the formation of an intramolecular ZnCD4 complex is less likely. This notion is supported by the CD4ct mutant analysis that shows its strong homodimerization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> Here, the decrease in fluorescence lifetime also indicates CD4 Zn 2+ -dependent dimerization.</p><p>Apart from the factor of subunit concentration and the presence of the membrane, the research undertook to verify the influence of CD4 palmitoylation on zinc clasp assembly. So far, differential protein segregation resulting from their palmitoylation has been shown to contribute to the T cell activation processes at the cellular membrane. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> The zinc clasp was demonstrated to partition into lipid rafts, whereas CD4 was localized mostly in tetraspanin-enriched microdomains, and the process was found to be dependent on CD4 palmitoylation and CD4-Lck association. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> Conducted experiments revealed that incorporation of a long fatty acid chain on the CD4 cytoplasmic tail changes its Zn 2+ -binding properties significantly. In solution, palmitoylated CD4ct forms one-order magnitude weaker complexes with Zn 2+ and Lck-UD. A feasible explanation is that in solution steric hindrance is substantially elevated, which prevents formation of a zinc clasp complex of higher stability. However, the interaction is completely abolished on the model membrane. Abrogated complex formation in the artificial membrane model may result from changed mobility of palmitoylated CD4. It is possible that long fatty acid chains are incorporated between membrane lipidic building blocks, making the protein domain less flexible. Such an observation also cannot exclude the The excitation of 488 and 561 nm with the emission filters of 530/30 and 610/20 nm was subjected to donor and acceptor channels, respectively. (CD4 + ) Jurkat T cells with stable CD4(Clover) expression; (CD4 + Lck + ) CD4 + Jurkat T cells transiently transfected with plasmid encoding Lck(mRuby2); (Lck + ) Jurkat T cells transiently transfected with plasmid encoding Lck(mRuby2); (Jurkat) Jurkat T cells as a control of transfection. (C) FRET studies of CD4 + Jurkat T cells expressing CD4(Clover) that was transiently transfected with Lck(mRuby2) plasmids. To obtain basal FRET, CD4 + cells were transiently transfected with mRuby2 (control). FRET was calculated as the relation of FRET to acceptor channels regarding the background fluorescence of non-transfected Jurkat T cells. Statistics were performed with one-way ANOVA with Tukey test with p &lt; 0.5 and n = 3-4 using Origin software. Error bars represent the average of 3-4 measurements in three independent experiments. scenario in which interactions in the case of CD4 palmitoylation do not appear in the investigated free Zn 2+ concentration range. Application of artificial membrane to dissect mechanistic details of the metal-and modification-dependent interaction is mostly advantageous. Although, it is worth noting that it lacks the spatiotemporal membrane organization present in a live cell. It has been shown that Lck membrane-anchor is crucial in efficient zinc clasp formation in live-cell experiments which indicates how dynamically zinc clasp may be modulated upon cellular response such as depalmitoylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> However, consideration of Zn 2+ complex formation in the context of directional enrichment within membrane subdomains is still very hard. Mechanistic details of such phenomena and the potential contribution of local Zn 2+ concentration are not yet resolved. In the face of a multitude of factors that contribute to the net outcome in the environment that would be beneficial or detrimental for complex formation, substantial efforts have been undertaken to reconstitute T cell membrane-proximal signaling events that resulted in its most critical mechanistic details. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> However, Zn 2+ has never contributed to the whole picture. It seems to be high time to include it in consideration of the early events of a T cell activation pathway.</p><p>To further explore the influence of Zn 2+ on the CD4, its fluorescent conjugate was expressed in a Jurkat T cells. Intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free was modulated and proved to be in the 0.02-0.8 nM range, consistently with the previously reported levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> Dual labeling of CD4 made it possible to observe the increase and the decrease of fluorescence in its extra-and intracellular parts, respectively, under increasing intracellular Zn 2+ concentrations. The increase of extracellular fluorescence may be thus explained by more CD4 being present at the cellular membrane whereas the intracellular decrease may be an indication of a Zn(CD4) 2 complex formation. However, it cannot be excluded that elevated intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free affected CD4 indirectly, causing its enrichment in the plasma membrane and the decrease of fluorescence due to e.g., molecular crowding. Certainly, Zn 2+ affects the cellular behavior of CD4, an observation that has not been reported before. To support this notion, the result of intracellular staining clearly shows that the overall pool of CD4 protein rises under Zn 2+ supplementation. Not only involvement of Zn 2+ in the process of CD4 presentation but also its presentation itself has been rarely investigated. So far, the opposite phenomenon, i.e., CD4 internalization, has been widely studied e.g., during HIV viral infection, which positioned CD4 count as a diagnostic biomarker. <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> Nevertheless, the presence of CD4 dimers has been shown, highlighting both its extracellular part and cytoplasmic cysteinyl residues responsible for the interaction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79</ref> The role of CD4 dimers has been proposed to be a prolonged contact with APC and increased TCR-APC avidity at the immunological synapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79</ref> As a result, the CD4 monomer to dimer transition may play a role in the initial engagement during T cell activation, tuning the activation threshold. Recently, Horkova et al. reported CD4 surface levels being dependent on Lck. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> They found the process to be kinase independent which allows the possibility of zinc contribution in CD4 surface regulation.</p><p>The interplay of Zn 2+ between CD4 and Lck is supported by the fact that the same cysteinyl residues govern CD4 dimeric assembly and the CD4-Lck formation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> To examine zinc clasp presence in T cells, a range of Lck plasmids were introduced to the CD4 + cell line where FRET analysis showed that CD4-Lck interaction indeed occurs in the resting state of T cells. Therefore, zinc status may affect the reactivity or activation threshold of resting T cells, which is seen in the reduced T cell activity of zinc-deficient patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> Furthermore, this may explain why zinc supplementation has different effects on resting and activated T cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81</ref> The involvement of Zn 2+ is manifested by a significant decrease of the level of the interaction when Zn 2+binding cysteinyl residues are mutated in Lck(wt). Interestingly, the Lck(UD) domain on its own is not able to perceive the same efficiency of the assembly as Lck(wt). It suggests that other Lck domain(s) are possibly involved and play a supporting role. (C) Species distribution of CD4 as a function of CD4 and Lck increasing concentrations. Total Lck concentration was increased from 0.5 to 1500 nM while CD4 increased from 2 to 6,000 nM in such a way that in all simulated points, the CD4/Lck molar ratio was set as 4.0. All distributions were calculated using HySS software (see supplemental information).</p><p>Stimulation of CD4 + Lck + cells by the time matching initial phase of T cell activation where zinc influx was found to operate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> showed a similar effect of CD4-Lck increase. It is worth noting that CD4, Lck, and TCR molecules were reported to be present in separate clusters when cells were nonactivated, whereas upon activation larger structures were observed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82</ref> However, large interfacial surfaces may explain the pre-activation possibility of zinc clasp formation. Therefore, Zn 2+ may be essential for T cell activation, but it also explains why high Zn 2+ concentrations inhibit T cell activation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> Altogether, the conducted experiments indicate that interplay between Zn(CD4) 2 and Zn(CD4)(Lck) is feasible. However, the distinction between formation of two complexes when both are based on the same components should be made with care. On the one hand, methodological restrictions occur regarding the contribution of fluorescence from two differently composed complexes. On the other, accurate determination of intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free is highly needed. In vitro studies demonstrate that the formation of homo-and heterodimeric Zn 2+ complexes is well separated within the [Zn 2+ ] free range <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> ; however, the near-membrane intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free is not yet determined. In the view of FluoZin-3, which is generally known as a cytosolic zinc probe, it is worth noting that there are reports that it localizes within vesicles. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> But it was also found that its distribution is strictly dependent on the cell line, yet different localization has been reported. <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83</ref> However, in the process of T cell activation, it has been shown that an increase in intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free results primarily from lysosomal Zn 2+ release under upregulation of the ZIP8 transporter. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Regarding the investigation of overall intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free , it should be applicable, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> but one should keep in mind that local [Zn 2+ ] free values may differ.</p><p>Peptide models show that CD4ct and Lck-UD complex forms in the range of 10 À14 -10 À11 M of free Zn 2+ in solution. Incorporation of them into a model membrane shows that, indeed, the complex forms at 10 À14 M, which suggests that it will not be affected by intracellular Zn 2+ fluctuations. However, the nature of Zn 2+ -based heterocomplex lets the concentration of its constituents regulate it. Therefore, simulations were introduced based on the stability constants reported for peptide models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> Apart from the fact that the stability data for Zn 2+ complexes of peptide models could be translated quantitatively into natural protein molecules and unknown protein concentrations, the simulations show that [Zn 2+ ] free alterations have a substantial impact on CD4 speciation and are able to change molar ratio between Zn(CD4)(Lck) and Zn(CD4) 2 species. A change of [Zn 2+ ] free between 0.1 and 10 nM leads to a substantial shift toward Zn(CD4) 2 formation. This notion is supported by the CD4 responsiveness to intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free between 0.1 and 0.6 nM observed for CD4 + Jurkat T cells. Although further increase of intracellular [Zn 2+ ] free could not be obtained, its higher values cannot be excluded, especially in a local manner. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Interestingly, the fraction of Zn(CD4)(Lck) persists at $25% in physiologically relevant free Zn 2+ concentrations. However, when we alter CD4, the fraction of homocomplex profile strongly depends on the free Zn 2+ status where changes in molar ratio occur. While increasing both CD4 and Lck, at a constant ratio, increase of Zn(CD4) 2 species occurs, with Zn(CD4)(Lck) being stable to these changes. Currently, the exact determination of CD4 and Lck level and therefore their Zn 2+ complexes is impossible. However, local concentration of CD4-Lck is increased in the immunological synapse. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> It has also been reported that membrane signaling proteins of Jurkat T cells follow diffusional trapping that leads to an increase in their concentration and/or their exclusion, thanks to the formation of distinct microdomains such as CD2/LAT/Lck coclusters. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> In addition, CD4 and the zinc clasp undergo different partitioning in the membrane subdomains and these processes were found to be correlated with TCR signaling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> It needs to be emphasized that these calculations are only approximations, and their purpose is to illustrate how dynamic the CD4/ Lck system is, and that various scenarios are possible. Very likely there are optimal conditions that enhance the formation of the heterocomplex or promote formation of the homocomplex. Other processes, such as membrane partitioning and/or immune synapse formation, might also affect the local availability of CD4/Lck. Furthermore, it is possible that CD4 palmitoylation, being a reversible process, is highly involved. A complete understanding of the role that CD4, Lck, and Zn 2+ play in T cell activation needs further investigation.</p></div>

N-termini of peptides were acetylated with acetate anhydride (8 equiv.) or myristylated with myristic acid (10 eq.) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA, 10 equiv). On-resin coupling of FAM and TAMRA (4 equiv.) to the N-terminus was performed with COMU (4 equiv.) and DIEA in DMF (10 equiv). GSS linker at the N terminus was applied before FAM (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Palmitoylation of CD4ct was performed using orthogonal coupling via Fmoc-Cys(Mtt)-OH. Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)-OH was used to introduce FAM or TAMRA at the C terminus of CD4ct and Lck. The 4-methyltrityl protecting group (Mtt) was removed with 1% TFA in DCM (dichloromethane) for 15 min (5 times). Resin cleavage was performed with a mixture of TFA/EDT/thioanisole/anisole/TIPS/H2O (86:3:5:2:2:2, v/v/v/v/v/v) over a period of 4 h. After evaporation of the solution to the minimum volume under nitrogen atmosphere, peptides were precipitated with cold diethyl ether (À20 C). Crude peptide pellets were centrifuged (4 C) and washed with cold diethyl ether (5-7 times) to get rid of the excess of scavengers.

(B) FRET studies of fluorescently labeled CD4ct(FAM) with Lck-UD(TAMRA) and CD4ct(p)(FAM) with Lck-UD(TAMRA) are presented in blue and green, respectively. The FRET ratio (525/573 nm) was normalized and presented as the function of [Zn 2+ ] free . Data points were fitted to Hill's function and the obtained binding isotherms are presented as green and blue lines. (C) Schematic representation of a GUV vesicle with embedded CD4ct(p)(FAM) in gray and Lck-UD(TAMRA) in wine via N-terminal myristylation. Palmitoylation is depicted as a black zigzag. Zn 2+ is represented by a blue circle. Fluorescent modification of peptide domains has been marked as yellow and wine glowing dots. (D) FRET-FLIM studies of CD4ct(p)(FAM) with (green) or without Lck-UD(TAMRA) in gray embedded in the GUV membrane. Negative control of CD4p(FAM) and Lck-UD(TAMRA) in chelexed 50 mM HEPES, 0.1 M KCl pH 7.4 without Zn 2+ is shown in orange. A lifetime of FAM fluorescence was measured for at least 10 different GUVs at different free Zn 2+ concentrations. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA with the Tukey test with p &lt; 0.5 and n = 3-5 using Origin software. Error bars represent the average of 3-5 different GUV images. Significant differences refer to the ''no Zn 2+ '' control.</figDesc><graphic coords="6,59.75,101.71,316.80,275.47" type="bitmap" /></figure>
