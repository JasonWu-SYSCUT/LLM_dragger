<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) chemoresistance hampers the ability to effectively treat patients. Identification of mechanisms driving chemoresistance can lead to strategies to improve treatment. Here, we revealed that protein arginine methyltransferase-1 (PRMT1) simultaneously methylates D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), a critical enzyme in serine synthesis, and the glycolytic enzymes PFKFB3 and PKM2 in TNBC cells. 13 C metabolic flux analyses showed that PRMT1-dependent methylation of these three enzymes diverts glucose toward intermediates in the serine-synthesizing and serine/glycine cleavage pathways, thereby accelerating the production of methyl donors in TNBC cells. Mechanistically, PRMT1-dependent methylation of PHGDH at R54 or R20 activated its enzymatic activity by stabilizing 3-phosphoglycerate binding and suppressing polyubiquitination. PRMT1mediated PHGDH methylation drove chemoresistance independently of glutathione synthesis. Rather, activation of the serine synthesis pathway supplied a-ketoglutarate and citrate to increase palmitate levels through activation of fatty acid synthase (FASN). Increased palmitate induced protein S-palmitoylation of PHGDH and FASN to further enhance fatty acid synthesis in a PRMT1dependent manner. Loss of PRMT1 or pharmacologic inhibition of FASN or protein S-palmitoyltransferase reversed chemoresistance in TNBC. Furthermore, IHC coupled with imaging MS in clinical TNBC specimens substantiated that PRMT1-mediated methylation of PHGDH, PFKFB3, and PKM2 correlates with chemoresistance and that metabolites required for methylation and fatty acid synthesis are enriched in TNBC. Together, these results suggest that enhanced de novo fatty acid synthesis mediated by coordinated protein arginine methylation and protein S-palmitoylation is a therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance in TNBC.</p><p>Significance: PRMT1 promotes chemoresistance in TNBC by methylating metabolic enzymes PFKFB3, PKM2, and PHGDH to augment de novo fatty acid synthesis, indicating that targeting this axis is a potential treatment strategy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Among the subtypes of breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which expresses none of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, is the most aggressive type of breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. Compared with other subtypes, TNBC lacks specific therapeutic targets and is resistant to chemotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying TNBC chemoresistance require further investigation.</p><p>In recent years, metabolic remodeling has attracted considerable attention as a mechanism by which cancer cells acquire chemoresistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Among the many pathways in metabolic systems, transmethylation via the serine synthesis pathway (SSP) and glycine cleaving enzymes, the transfer of C1 unit to specific substrates, and the remethylation cycle play important roles in DNA methylation and/or histone modifications to determine the fate of cancer cells. However, the roles of posttranslational modifications of proteins/enzymes by methylation mechanisms remain unclear. We previously showed that protein arginine methylation of 6-phosphofructo-2kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) is methylated by protein arginine methyltransferase-1 (PRMT1) to activate phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1; ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>. Such a post-translational modification of PFKFB3 contributes to a metabolic shift towards the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to accelerate the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a reducing equivalent for recycling reduced glutathione (GSH), which may help chemoresistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. In addition, many studies have shown that PRMTs methylate several enzymes that regulate carbohydrate metabolism such as pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), GAPDH, and malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1; refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Of the PRMT subtypes, PRMT1 and PRMT4 have been reported to be highly expressed in progressive breast cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>; however, their roles in arginine methylation in tumorigenesis and the acquisition of malignant traits remain unclear.</p><p>This study aimed to examine whether TNBC chemoresistance is mediated by protein arginine methylation of enzymes belonging to the central carbon metabolisms. In this study, 13 C 6 -glucose-assisted fluxome analyses were performed using several drug-resistant TNBC cell lines to explore unidentified aberrant metabolic pathways that facilitate chemoresistance. Our analyses showed that PRMT1, which possesses major methyltransferase activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, not only increases methylated PFKFB3 and PKM2, but also methylates 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme in SSP, which accelerates the directional conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), a glycolytic intermediate, towards SSP. Mechanistically, PRMT1 simultaneously activates de novo fatty acid synthesis through the production of a-ketoglutarate (aKG), a product of phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), the second enzyme in the SSP. Furthermore, either inhibition of fatty acid synthase (FASN) by orlistat or blockade of PRMT1-involving protein S-palmitoylation by 2-bromopalmitate (2-Br-Pal) unlocks chemoresistance in TNBC cells. Here, we provide evidence that PRMT1-mediated protein arginine methylation of PHGDH, PFKFB3, and PKM2, not only accounts for the positive biomarkers of TNBC but also serves as a therapeutic target for unlocking TNBC chemoresistance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Establishment of paclitaxel-resistant MDA-MB-231 cell</head><p>An in vivo paclitaxel-resistant (Ptx-R) cell line was established from the parental human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 by stepwise increasing concentrations of paclitaxel administrated to tumorbearing mice. Briefly, BALB/c female nude mice were purchased from CLEA Japan, Inc. at 6 weeks of age. Each mouse was inoculated subcutaneously in the dorsal flank with 1 Â 10 6 cells in 0.1 mL serumfree medium containing 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Paclitaxel treatment starts at day14 after tumor inoculation. Tumor-bearing mice were intraperitoneally administered paclitaxel (20 mg/kg) eight times every 3 to 4 days. After a dosing period, tumors were excised and digested into a residual metastatic nodule-free MDA-MB-231 suspension using the Tumor Dissociation Kit (#130-095-929; Miltenyi Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cells were retransplanted subcutaneously into fresh mice. The schedule of paclitaxel administration was as mentioned above, with 30 mg/kg for the second rounds, and 60 mg/kg for the third rounds, respectively. After three rounds of this procedures, three different sublines of Ptx-R MDA-MB-231 cells were established. Unless otherwise stated, the subclone#2 cells were used in this study. Ptx-R cells were maintained with the medium containing 5 nmol/L Ptx. We also established in vitro Ptx-resistant model. The resistant cells were generated by stepwise increasing the concentration of paclitaxel (4, 10, 20, and 40 nmol/L) in the medium over 3 to 4 months.</p></div>

MCF7, generated from HER2-positive breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, was sensitive to increased concentrations of doxorubicin, whereas TNBC cell lines such as BT-20, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 were significantly less sensitive to doxorubicin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Among the three doxorubicin-resistant TNBC cell lines, the most resistant to paclitaxel was MDA-MB-468 as compared with MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). On the basis of these data, MDA-MB-468 is an innately chemoresistant TNBC cell line that can be used as anticancer reagents.</p><p>We have previously reported the switching mechanism of central carbon metabolism to sustain antioxidative capacity through PRMT1involving PFKFB3 methylation in colon cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15)</ref>. Therefore, we first investigated the expression and methylation levels of key enzymes involved in carbohydrate and sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism in these TNBC cell lines. Among the four cell lines, MDA-MB-468, which was an innately Ptx-resistant line, showed higher methylation of PFKFB3 and PKM2 than Ptx-sensitive MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). We confirmed that PKM2 was methylated by PRMT1, leading to a transition to dimerization (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A-S1J</ref>). Another important difference between MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells was the overexpression of PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH, which are enzymes belonging to SSP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</p><p>To define the clinical relevance of SSP enzymes and PRMT1 gene expression in drug-resistant TNBC patients, we analyzed the public cancer genome database Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Analyses of large-scale transcriptomic datasets showed significantly greater expression of PRMT1, PHGDH, and PSAT1 in patients classified as having basal-like type breast cancer, including TNBC in different datasets (Supplementary Figs. S2A, S2D, S2G, and S3A-S3C). The expression levels of these genes were positively correlated with histologic tumor grades (Supplementary Figs. S2B, S2E, and S2H); however, higher expression was also observed in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (Supplementary Figs. S2C, S2F, and S2I). These results led us to imply that, similar to the results of the current cell line experiments, the augmentation of de novo serine-synthesizing pathway in patients with TNBC may determine sensitivity to chemotherapy.</p><p>Therefore, we investigated whether chemoresistance in Ptxsensitive MDA-MB-231 cells enhance the expression of SSP enzymes and arginine-methylated PFKFB3 and PKM2. To establish Ptx-    resistant (Ptx-R) MDA-MB-231, the tumor was transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue of nude mice, followed by Ptx injection for a certain period, after which, the tumor was removed, digested, dispersed, and transplanted again. This cycle was repeated three times with increasing concentrations of Ptx to obtain chemoresistant MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). Notably, the arginine methylation of PFKFB3 and PKM2 was elevated in all three established clones (#1, #2, and #3), consistent with the expression of the drug resistance marker ABCG1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> as well as the induction of the three SSP enzymes, PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref>). These characteristics were shared with the innately Ptx-R MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Parental cells exhibited augmentation of cell death with increasing Ptx concentrations, whereas the established Ptx-R cells displayed significant suppression of cell death (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>). We further established in vitro Ptx-R model with stepwise increasing concentration of Ptx, showing that established cells in vitro also showed similar patterns of enzyme expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4B</ref>).</p><p>The protein arginine methylation of PFKFB3 and PKM2 coincided with chemoresistance against Ptx (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). Therefore, we investigated whether PRMT1 and/or PRMT4, which have been reported as methyltransferases for metabolic enzymes in various type of cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>, play an important role in chemotherapy resistance to Ptx. The Ptx-induced cell death of the parent cell was not altered by treatment with sgPRMT1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>), whereas the Ptxresistant MDA-MB-231 cells displayed no significant increase in cell death with increasing Ptx concentrations, which was significantly unlocked with sgPRMT1 but not with sgPRMT4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>). These results suggested that PRMT1, but not PRMT4, plays a critical role in Ptx-induced cell death. The resistance seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> was not a generalized but Ptx-dependent event, because MDA-MB-468 exhibited greater sensitivity than MDA-MB-231 against cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5A</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PHGDH is R20-or R54-methylated by PRMT1 to maintain the enzymatic activities</head><p>PHGDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the SSP. To date, many studies have reported that its activity is regulated by various posttranslational modifications <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. The observation that the increased arginine methylation of PFKFB3 and PKM2 by PRMT1 and the simultaneous upregulation of SSP enzymes in TNBC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>) led us to investigate whether PHGDH undergoes PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation to alter catalytic activities. To determine the domain(s) of PHGDH responsible for binding to PRMT1, several deletion mutants were prepared as shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>; the nucleotide binding domain (NBD)-deficient mutant (DNBD) did not show immunoprecipitated signals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), suggesting that the NBD plays a critical role in binding to PRMT1. According to previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, the sequence around the 295th amino acid called "THW loop," is responsible for stabilizing the peptidyl-arginine substrate pocket cooperated with the catalytic core. We have also shown that D295 mutant, which disrupted the structure near the THW loop, showed a remarkable decrease in the binding to FLAG-tagged PHGDH (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>).</p><p>To identify the methylated residues of PHGDH by PRMT1, HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged human PHGDH were established. Finally, we identified three arginine residues involved in arginine methylation (R20, R54, and R268). As seen in the MS data, R20 was modified with dimethylarginine, whereas R54 and R268, and a portion of R20 contained monomethyl-arginine (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>; Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S7A-S7D</ref>). HEK293T cells expressing several PHGDH site-directed mutants revealed that the mutation at R268K increased enzyme activity, whereas the R20K or R54K mutant significantly reduced enzymatic activity (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>). Putative relationship between methylation of different R residues and the activities was shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S8</ref>. Our results suggested that the reduced activity of the R54K mutant is due to the reduced affinity for 3-PG and NAD þ , the substrate or coenzyme of PHGDH consistent with the previous findings. (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S8A;</ref><ref type="figure"></ref> refs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>. On the other hand, R20K showed similar substrate affinity compared with WT, suggesting the obvious functional differences between R20 and R54 arginine methylation. As seen later, polyubiquitination serves as a critical mechanism for stability of the enzyme. Therefore, we focused on R20 and R54, which are present in the substrate recognition domain affecting their enzyme activity. We also raised a polyclonal antibody against R54-monomethylated PHGDH, which reacted specifically with monomethylated peptides (R54). The signals corresponding to arginine methylation of PHGDH disappeared in PRMT1 knockout cells, suggesting that this event is mediated by PRMT1 (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S8B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S8C</ref>). Among the four breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468 cells showed the greatest level of PHGDH methylation, similar to the methylation of PFKFB3 and PKM2 (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>). Moreover, PHGDH methylation was increased in Ptx-resistant strains, whereas such methylation was abolished in MDA-MB-231 cells with the PRMT1 knockout (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>). We also examined whether knocking out either PRMT1 or PRMT4 alters the enzymatic activities of PHGDH: treatment with sgPRMT1, but not with sgPRMT4, significantly suppresses the enzymatic activity of PHGDH in both MDA-MB-468 and Ptx-R MDA-MB-231 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S8D</ref>).</p></div>

We also examined 13 C-metabolites with shorter incubation period of time at 15 minutes, where increases in PPP metabolites and the elevation of TCA cycle intermediates seems smaller than those measured at 30 minutes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>). On the other hand, 13 C 6 -assisted fluxome analyses revealed that the Ptx-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells upregulated G-6-P, F-1,6-BP, glycerol-3P, serine (mþ1), methionine (mþ1), and SAM (mþ1), suggesting that acquisition of Ptx chemoresistance coincided with increased glucose biotransformation into the SSP and serine/glycine cleavage system (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10A</ref>). These results suggest that coordinated methylation of three enzymes shifts glucose utilization into the serine synthesizing pathway. These metabolic changes can be partly explained by PRMT1-mediated changes in PK activity. Namely, methylated PKM2 showed reduced activity due to its dimerization, whereas demethylated PKM2 was tetrameric and highly active in PRMT1-deficient cells (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1H-S1J</ref>, S10B, and S10C).</p><p>Alterations in many metabolites in metabolome analyses often consider a possibility that a metabolite belonging to distal pathways can influence the proximal pathway of the interest, therefore, nonbiased bird's eye view with volcano plots is useful (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11A</ref>). In PRMT1-KO MDA-MB-468, many metabolites in PPP and glycolysis and TCA intermediates were elevated, presumably because of reduction of the carbon flux into SSP and fatty acid synthesis as discussed later. Furthermore, the exogenous application of 2-PG, an allosteric activator of PHGDH <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, actually increases the catalytic activity of PHGDH, which might mask the inhibitory effect of PRMT1-KO on SSP (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11B</ref>). Furthermore, SSP provides aKG, which is also delivered through the TCA cycle. We thus inquired how many percentages PHGDH contributes to aKG supply from SSP: as seen in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11C</ref>, the PHGDH-deficient MDA-MB-468 caused a significant suppression of aKG by 60%, suggesting that SSP started by PHGDH plays a major role for aKG supply at least in the cultured cell.</p><p>Notably, sgPRMT1 treatment elevated the GSH/GSSG ratio, which coincided with increased PPP metabolites in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). These results were in good agreement with our previous studies showing the effects of demethylation of PFKFB3, which delivers glucose into the PPP to increase NADPH and potentiate the antioxidative capacity in different cancer cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. We also examined the chemosensitivity of the PRMT1-deficient MDA-MB-468 cells to Ptx. Surprisingly, knocking out of PRMT1 rendered MDA-MB-468 cells significantly sensitive to Ptx, despite the increased GSH/GSSG ratio (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>; Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5C</ref>), suggesting that GSH is not attributable to the chemoresistance of the cells.</p><p>Although the most recent paper reported that PRMT1 regulates several glycolytic enzymes through the histone H4R3 methylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>, metabolic enzymes or previously known epigenetic regulators were not mined in our RNA-seq data illustrated with the volcano plot between the PRMT1-KO and wild-type TNBC cells (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Paclitaxel chemoresistance coincides with increased de novo fatty acid synthesis in TNBC</head><p>Both chemoresistant and acquired Ptx-resistant cells activate glycolysis via mPFKFB3 induction under incomplete PK inhibition through increased mPKM2, thereby supplying carbon units from glycolysis towards SSP via mPHGDH; methylation of PFKFB3, PKM2, and PHGDH is dependent on PRMT1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10A</ref>), however, PRMT1-involving, and SSP-induced chemore-sistance led us to identify unidentified mechanisms for cancer survival in addition to GSH. As seen in MDA-MB-468 cells, metabolites of the TCA cycle, such as citrate, aconitate, isocitrate, and aKG, were elevated significantly by knocking out of PRMT1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). In addition to being derived from the TCA cycle, aKG is also derived from the PSAT1-coupling reaction that belongs to SSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46)</ref>, which plays a critical role as a source of aKG as mentioned previously (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11C</ref>), and could be converted to citrate and acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48)</ref>. This notion led us to hypothesize that the increases in these metabolites in PRMT1-knockout cells reflect a reduced utilization and resultant overflow of the metabolites for fatty acid synthesis. The 13 C 6 -glucose utilization assay for fatty acids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>) revealed that the amounts of 13 C-labeled palmitate species was significantly decreased by sgPRMT1 treatment of MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>), while Ptx-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells also showed a significant elevation in 13 C-labeled palmitate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). These results suggest that PRMT1 augments de novo fatty acid synthesis in TNBC cells with Ptx chemoresistance.</p><p>Various compounds that alter fatty acid synthesis were examined (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>): orlistat, which is an inhibitor of FASN <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>, and significantly unlocked the chemoresistance of MDA-MB-468 cells. The unlocking effects of orlistat were mimicked by knocking out PRMT1 but not PRMT4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>). Treatment with dimethyl-ketoglutarate (dmKG), which provides aKG into cells (50), or 2-Br-Pal, a potent inhibitor of protein S-palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref>, induced the suppression or enhancement of Ptx-induced cell death, respectively, in MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>). Treatment with orlistat did not alter Ptx-induced cell death in the parental MDA-MB-231 cells, while increasing significantly the death of Ptx-R cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>). Increasing concentrations of dmKG reduced cell death in parental MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13A</ref>). Notably, treatment with 2-Br-Pal dose-dependently unlocked chemoresistance in Ptx-resistant MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4H</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13B</ref>). We examined effects of orlistat or 2-Br-Pal on BT-20 with lower methylation level (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>), showing no significant elevation of the cell death (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13C</ref>). Likewise, in MDA-MB-468 cells, treatment with MS023, a potent inhibitor of PRMT1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>, or with 2-Br-Pal cancelled the chemoresistance against Ptx (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13D</ref>).</p></div>

S14A and S14B showed fatty acid accumulation in the Ptx-resistant MDA-MB-231 in culture; panels A and B showed elevation of the endogenous fatty acid storage and incorporation of the fluorescence-tagged palmitate into the Ptx-resistant cells, respectively. The magnified images exhibited intracellular localization of the incorporated fatty acid; in the parent cells, the fluorescence appeared to occur in mitochondria and partly in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the Ptx-resistant cells were filled with enhanced fluorescence at perinuclear region being spared. These events of fatty acid accumulation and incorporation were markedly attenuated by treatment with sgPRMT1. On the other hand, the baseline fatty acid b-oxidation was unlikely to differ among the parent, Ptx-resistant, and sgPRMT1-treated Ptx-R cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PRMT1-mediated S-palmitoylation of PHGDH and FASN prevents their polyubiquitination</head><p>The observation that 2-Br-Pal cancelled the chemoresistance in TNBC cell lines (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>) led us to hypothesize that protein S-palmitoylation plays a crucial role in the amelioration of Ptx-induced cancer cell death. Among the enzymes contributing to the accelerated transformation of 3-PG towards SSP and fatty acid synthesis, we herein identified PHGDH and FASN as targets. The ABE method (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>; ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref> allowed us to show that PHGDH, FASN, and the EGF receptor (EGFR) were protein S-palmitoylated in MDA-MB-468 cells, and were repressed by knocking out PRMT1 but not PRMT4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S15</ref>). Acquisition of chemoresistance to Ptx enhanced S-palmitoylation of PHGDH, FASN, and EGFR, which was also suppressed by knocking out PRMT1, but not PRMT4, in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S15</ref>). Furthermore, conditional downregulation/upregulation of PRMT1 using the doxycycline (DOX)-on/off system of shPRMT1 has shown that S-palmitoylation of PHGDH and FASN alters reversibly (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S15</ref>). Recent studies have suggested that PHGDH overexpression is regulated by several ubiquitin ligases in various cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. Thus, we examined the roles of RNF5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to PHGDH <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> through the SBD1 domain, where R20 and K21 of PHGDH are located (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S16A</ref>). HEK293 cells expressing deletion mutants (DelM) of PHGDH were prepared, and the cells lacking SBD1 did not show binding to RNF5. Notably, PHGDH and FASN protein were accumulated in RNF5knockout MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S16B</ref>). Compared with the parental cells, Ptx-R MDA-MB-231 cells displayed reduced Ub-dependent degradation, while treatment with sgPRMT1, but not sgPRMT4, accelerated PHGDH degradation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref>). Comparable results were achieved in MDA-MB-468 cells, which were innately resistant to Ptx (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5G</ref>). Since R20K-mutated PHGDH activates polyubiquitination to decrease enzymatic activity, the unmethylable mutant may induce hyperpolyubiquitination at the adjacent K21 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5H</ref>), thereby decreasing the catalytic activity of PHGDH.</p><p>Several studies have shown that FASN activity is also regulated by polyubiquitination <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>. As shown in Supplementary Figs. S17A and S17B, MDA-MB-468 and Ptx-R MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited marked enhancement of FASN polyubiquitination in response to knockout of PRMT1, but not PRMT4. We also demonstrated that the introduction of unmethylable PHGDH mutants (R20K or R54K) or pharmacological PHGDH blockade augmented the polyubiquitination of FASN (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S17C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S17D</ref>). These results suggest that PRMT1-mediated PHGDH activation prevents polyubiquitination and stabilizes FASN for fatty acid synthesis in TNBC. We further examined the possibility of cross-talk between arginine methylation and other post-translational modifications (S-palmitoylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation) in Supplementary Figs. S18A to S18D. As a result, we showed that arginine methylation acted to sustain the PHGDH enzymatic activity cooperated with S-palmitoylation and acetylation (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S18A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S18C</ref>).</p></div>

PHGDH and FASN coincided in the regions enriched in cancer cell clusters to a greater extent than in the stromal regions (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A, d</ref> and<ref type="figure">A, e</ref>, respectively), although we confirmed that both areas were not stained with secondary antibodies only (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A,</ref><ref type="figure">k</ref>). Notably, methylated PHGDH (R54), methylated PFKFB3 (R131/134), and methylated PKM2 (R445/447) were detected in the nuclei of cancer cells, whereas the total expression of these enzymes in the stromal regions was negligible (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1K</ref>).

IMS in frozen serial tissue slices derived from the same TNBC block showed the accumulation of upstream metabolites in glycolysis [G-1-P/G-6-P, F-1,6-BP, GA3P, and phosphoglycerates (PG)], citrate, and palmitoylcarnitine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>). To visualize amino acids that are hardly ionized in IMS, we applied a sensitive derivatization method with p-N,N,N,-trimethylammonioanilyl N'-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate iodide (TAHS) to semi-serial frozen TNBC tissue sections <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.

We thus confirmed their nuclear localization of these enzymes by using Western blotting in the nuclear fraction of Ptx-R MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S20</ref>). Since not all patients recruited for frozen needle biopsy have experienced chemotherapy yet, we attempted to collect a small cohort including 9 TNBC patients who experienced needle biopsy followed by neoadjuvant therapy to diagnose pCR/non-pCR. In these patients, needle-biopsied samples were all treated with FFPE. In the FFPE samples, the antibodies for mPKM2 and mPHGDH were unable to be used, but those PRMT1 and mPFKFB3 were able to detect the antigens. As seen, the FFPE samples collected from patients who were diagnosed as TNBC and later experienced adjuvant chemotherapy suggested significant increases in the number of nuclear immunostaining of PRMT1 and mPFKFB3 in the cancer cells in non-pCR cases than pCR cases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). On the other hand, immunostaining of breast cancer markers was absent in the TNBC patients in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S21</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we demonstrated that PHGDH, the rate-limiting serine synthesizing enzyme, is methylated by PRMT1 in chemoresistant TNBC. We also showed that PRMT1-involving coordinated methylation of three enzymes (PHGDH, PFKFB3, and PKM2) catalyzes the biotransformation of glucose into SSP, which branches out of glycolysis to deliver substrates for the survival of TNBC cell lines (Figs. 1C, 2G, 2H, and 6A). PHGDH is highly expressed in many solid cancers with poor prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. Furthermore, the open database of breast cancer patients suggested that higher mRNA expression of PRMT1, PHGDH, and PSAT1 correlated with malignancy (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</p><p>In recent reports, several types of post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, have been reported to regulate PHGDH activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. In this study, we identified the residues of PHGDH (R20 and R54) methylated by PRMT1 (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). We have shown that dimethylation of R20, located in substrate binding domain1 (SDB1), competes with the polyubiquitination of K21 to stabilize the active enzyme, while R54 acts to stabilize the affinity for the substrate (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5H</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">S8A</ref>). Furthermore, site-specific antibodies allowed the detection of R54 hypermethylation in paclitaxel-resistant strains and specimens from patients with TNBC (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G, 2H,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>). These results collectively unveiled that arginine methylation of R20 and R54 is necessary to support the enzymatic activity of PHGDH. Recent studies have reported that R54 acts on substrate selectivity depending on the phosphorylation state of the neighboring S55 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56)</ref>, suggesting that the methylation of R54 may be involved in these processes.</p><p>Further investigation of the feedback loops between PRMT1-mediated arginine methylation and the other modification is obviously necessary to understand the whole picture of regulatory mechanisms for TNBC chemoresistance.</p><p>Another research group reported that the activation of PHGDH through the monomethylation of different arginine residue R236 (located at the substrate recognition site) by PRMT1 shunts into the glutathione synthetic pathway to reduce ROS levels for hepatocellular carcinoma progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>. However, our results indicate a glutathione-independent mechanism to acquire chemoresistance of TNBC (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10A</ref>). Further investigation of PRMT1involving regulatory mechanisms for PHGDH methylation and activity among cancer types is warranted.</p><p>PRMTs have recently attracted greater attention as potential targets for cancer therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>. Remarkably, we have shown that the role of PRMT1 in regulating glucose metabolism in TNBC is not a local effect on PHGDH but multicentric effects of PRMT1-mediated methylation of PFKFB3 and PKM2 (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C, 2G,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2H</ref>). Such coordinated methylation of enzymes by PRMT1 exerts critical actions on the following three steps of central carbon metabolism towards SSP through arginine methylation: (i) activation of glycolysis by methylated PFKFB3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, and (ii) acting as a "priming water" to switch the carbon source to serine metabolism by suppressing PKM2 activity through methylation (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10C</ref>), and (iii) augmentation of fatty acid synthesis by activated PHGDH via arginine methylation at R20 and R54 (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2, 4B,</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). Taken together, PRMT1 acts on metabolic remodeling to support the maintenance of vigorous proliferative capacity and drug resistance through the cooperative arginine methylation of the three enzymes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). These results were further confirmed in clinical specimens. Higher expression of metabolic enzymes (PRMT1, mPFKFB3, mPKM2, and mPHGDH) and most of the corresponding metabolites were observed in chemoresistant cancer cell nests of needle biopsies (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). Regarding the role of SSP in chemoresistance, our group has recently revealed that the same pathway contributes to the upregulation of reactive sulfur species, including polysulfides, which play a critical role in rendering cancer cells resistant to anticancer reagents in ovarian clear cell carcinoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> and invasive breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. While the mechanisms remain unknown, reactive sulfur species and polysulfides are enriched in cancer-associated stromal regions of invasive breast cancer. The results shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref> are in good agreement with those of our previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Further investigation is necessary to decipher the mechanisms underlying the regulation of metabolic systems to provide specific metabolites to specific regions of cancer tissues.</p><p>Our results also showed that PRMT1-mediated PHGDH methylation accelerates SSP, which activates fatty acid synthesis through the stabilization of FASN by S-palmitoylation in Ptx-resistant TNBC (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S17</ref>). Activation of SSP via PHGDH has attracted attention for its important role in the acquisition of malignancy, including the enhancement of folate metabolism via the serine/glycine cleavage system to activate the synthesis of nucleic acids and the production of sulfur-containing antioxidants such as glutathione and hypotaurine in progressive cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref>.

In the present study, we demonstrated that PHGDH-driven aKG, estimated to be about 60% derived from SSP, also serves as a source of fatty acids (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>; Supplementary   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11C</ref>). Fatty acid metabolism has been demonstrated to be augmented in progressive breast cancer, and FASN inhibitors are used in preclinical anticancer trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65)</ref>. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, Ptxresistant MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with higher methylation levels of PHGDH showed a greater fatty acid-synthesizing capacity. This study also revealed that the addition of orlistat to MDA-MB-468 cells unlocked the resistance to Ptx, whereas dmKG treatment of the Ptx-sensitive MDA-MB-231 parental line conferred Ptx resistance (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref> and<ref type="figure">G</ref>). These results support the notion that PRMT1dependent SSP activation accelerates fatty acid synthesis and triggers chemoresistance.</p><p>We also showed that PRMT1-involving regulation of S-palmitoylation of PHGDH and FASN occurs during the acquisition of paclitaxel resistance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). De novo synthesis of fatty acids is used as a source of cellular fuel, a building block to synthesize cell membranes, and an acyl-donor for protein S-palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref>. Protein S-palmitoy-lation affects protein localization, stabilization, activity regulation, and cell migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51)</ref>. Several studies have reported that signaling molecules such as Hedgehog, Wnt, and Ras are S-palmitoylated proteins in cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref>. Interestingly, EGFR resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been shown to be highly S-palmitoylation in squamous non-small cell lung cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>. This study showed that the activation of PHGDH by PRMT1 enhanced the S-palmitoylation of PHGDH and FASN through the activation of fatty acid synthesis in a positive feedback manner in chemoresistant cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). Moreover, we demonstrated that the administration of 2-Br-Pal to inhibit protein S-palmitoylation abolished chemoresistance in Ptx-R MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>), implying that the intervention of PRMT1-regulated S-palmitoylation also appears to be a promising therapeutic target for chemoresistance in TNBC.</p><p>In conclusion, we have herein provided a novel mechanism by which PRMT1 is responsible for the methylation of PHGDH and Schematic diagram of metabolic rewiring mechanisms in drug-resistant breast cancer cells. Drug-sensitive cells have lower methylation levels of PFKFB3, PKM2, and PHGDH, increasing polyubiquitination of PFKFB3, PHGDH, and FASN to reduce influx from the glycolytic system into the serine synthesizing pathway (top). PRMT1 methylates PFKFB3, PKM2, and PHGDH to determine the fate of the carbon source for fatty acid synthesis to support chemoresistance in TNBC (bottom). Arginine methylation of PHGDH (R20/54) stabilizes the enzyme to enhance the serine synthetic pathway and de novo fatty acid synthesis through augmentation of aKG coupled with a PSAT1involving reaction. Enhanced fatty acid synthesis sustains enzyme activity by S-palmitoylation of PHGDH and FASN through de novo synthesis of palmitate, promoting positive feedback between the serine synthetic pathway and fatty acid synthesis to acquire malignant traits in TNBC. Blockade of this feedback system using the PRMT1 inhibitor MS023 or S-palmitoyltransferase inhibitor 2-Br-Pal unlocks chemoresistance to paclitaxel. consequently induces protein S-palmitoylation, allowing TNBC to acquire its chemoresistance. The combined inhibition of PRMT1 activity and intervention in protein S-palmitoylation unlocked chemoresistance and induced cell death more effectively in TNBC.

As shown in Fig.4, Ptxresistant MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells with higher methylation levels of PHGDH showed a greater fatty acid-synthesizing capacity. This study also revealed that the addition of orlistat to MDA-MB-468 cells unlocked the resistance to Ptx, whereas dmKG treatment of the Ptx-sensitive MDA-MB-231 parental line conferred Ptx resistance (Figs.4E and G). These results support the notion that PRMT1dependent SSP activation accelerates fatty acid synthesis and triggers chemoresistance.We also showed that PRMT1-involving regulation of S-palmitoylation of PHGDH and FASN occurs during the acquisition of paclitaxel resistance (Fig.8).

Schematic diagram of metabolic rewiring mechanisms in drug-resistant breast cancer cells. Drug-sensitive cells have lower methylation levels of PFKFB3, PKM2, and PHGDH, increasing polyubiquitination of PFKFB3, PHGDH, and FASN to reduce influx from the glycolytic system into the serine synthesizing pathway (top). PRMT1 methylates PFKFB3, PKM2, and PHGDH to determine the fate of the carbon source for fatty acid synthesis to support chemoresistance in TNBC (bottom). Arginine methylation of PHGDH (R20/54) stabilizes the enzyme to enhance the serine synthetic pathway and de novo fatty acid synthesis through augmentation of aKG coupled with a PSAT1involving reaction. Enhanced fatty acid synthesis sustains enzyme activity by S-palmitoylation of PHGDH and FASN through de novo synthesis of palmitate, promoting positive feedback between the serine synthetic pathway and fatty acid synthesis to acquire malignant traits in TNBC. Blockade of this feedback system using the PRMT1 inhibitor MS023 or S-palmitoyltransferase inhibitor 2-Br-Pal unlocks chemoresistance to paclitaxel.</figDesc><graphic coords="16,82.09,96.15,354.00,452.04" type="bitmap" /></figure>
