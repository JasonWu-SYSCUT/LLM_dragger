<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Sept8 is a vesicle associated protein and there are two typical transcriptional variants (Sept8-204 and Sept8-201) expressed in mice brain. Interestingly, the coexpression of Sept8-204/Sept5 induces the formation of small sized vesiclelike structure, while that of the Sept8-201/Sept5 produces large puncta. Sept8 is previously shown to be palmitoylated. Here it was further revealed that protein palmitoylation is required for Sept8-204/Sept5 to maintain small sized vesiclelike structure and colocalize with synaptophysin, since either the expression of nonpalmitoylated Sept8-204 mutant (Sept8-204-3CA) or inhibiting Sept8-204 palmitoylation by 2-BP with Sept5 produces large puncta, which barely colocalizes with synaptophysin (SYP). Moreover, it was shown that the dynamic palmitoylation of Sept8-204 is controlled by ZDHHC17 and PPT1, loss of ZDHHC17 decreases Sept8-204 palmitoylation and induces large puncta, while loss of PPT1 increases Sept8-204 palmitoylation and induces small sized vesiclelike structure. Together, these findings suggest that palmitoylation is essential for the maintenance of the small sized vesicle-like structure for Sept8-204/Sept5, and may hint their important roles in synaptic functions.</p></div>

Previously, it was shown that the coexpression of Sept8 with Sept5 forms vesiclelike structure in mammalian cells, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> however, it was not clear which variant of Sept8 was used. To test whether Sept8 variants may cause divergent cellular consequence, we constructed Sept8-204 or Sept8-201 with a Flag (DYKDDDDK) tag at the N-terminal, and Sept5 with a Ha (YPYDVPDYA) tag at the C-terminal. Flag-Sept8-204 or Flag-Sept8-201 were coexpressed with Sept5-Ha in N2a cells. Interestingly, the expression of Flag-Sept8-204 with Sept5-Ha produces a similar size of vesicle-like structure as shown before (vesicle diameter approximately 0.25 μm), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> while the expression of Sept8-201 with Sept5 produces significantly larger puncta (puncta diameter approximately 1.79 μm) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>,B), confirmed also by 3D scanning images (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Both Flag-Sept8-204 and Flag-Sept8-201 have strong interactions with Sept5-Ha (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D,</ref><ref type="figure">E</ref>). Most strikingly, the expression of either Flag-Sept8-204, Flag-Sept8-201, or Sept5-Ha alone produces no such structure (Supporting Information S1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), suggesting that the coexpression with Sept5 is essential for the formation of vesicle-like structure. Furthermore, to understand how the large puncta forms, GFP-Sept8-201 (N-terminal green fluorescent protein-tagged Sept8-201) was coexpressed with Sept5-RFP (C-terminal red fluorescent proteintagged Sept5) for live cell imaging, and the imaging data showed that Sept8-201/Sept5 initially forms small vesicles, and gradually, they seem able to fuse and become larger puncta (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref> and Supporting Information S2: Video 1).</p></div>

Moreover, the treatment of 2-BP (palmitoylation inhibitor) decreases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2E</ref>,F), and that of PalmB (depalmitoylation inhibitor) increases (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G,</ref><ref type="figure">H</ref>), the level of Sept8-204 palmitoylation. To determine whether Sept8-204 palmitoylation is involved in regulating the size of puncta, Flag-Sept8-204 or the nonpalmitoylated Flag-Sept8-204-3CA was coexpressed with Sept5-Ha in N2a cells. Interestingly, the results showed that Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha produces small size vesicle-like structure, however, Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha produces large puncta (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>,J, upper). Both Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha and Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha were weakly colocalized with early endosome marker Rab5, lysosome marker Lamp1, autophagy marker LC3 or Golgi marker GM130 in N2a cells (Supporting Information S1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Consistently, inhibiting palmitoylation by 2-BP treatment transforms small size to large size puncta in cells expressing Sept8-204/Sept5 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2I</ref>,J, under). As we measure the size of vesicle-like structure, it suggests that the large puncta produced by Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha is comparable to that of the Flag-Sept8-201/Sept5-Ha (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>), hinting that palmitoylation at the C-terminus of Sept8-204 is essential for the formation of small size vesicle-like structure. Additionally, applying live-cell imaging, it was shown that Flag-Sept8-204/ Sept5-Ha induced vesicles are moving around very rapidly, while Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha induced puncta are not moving dynamically, rather tend to gather together to form large puncta (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2K</ref>, Supporting Information S1: Figure <ref type="figure">S3</ref>, Supporting Information S2: Videos 2-5). These results supported that Sept8-204 palmitoylation is required to maintain the stability of small vesicle-like structure.</p></div>

Furthermore, to test whether ZDHHC17 is involved in regulating vesicle size, Flag-Sept8-204/ Sept5-Ha was coexpressed in either N2a/WT or N2a/ ZDHHC17-KO cells, and the imaging data showed that Sept8-204/Sept5 produces small sized vesicle-like structure in N2a/WT cells, whereas Sept8-204/Sept5 produces large puncta in ZDHHC17-KO cells (Figure <ref type="figure">3G,</ref><ref type="figure">H</ref>), implying that ZDHHC17 mediated Sept8-204 palmitoylation is required for small sized vesicle formation. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G</ref>,H that depalmitoylation inhibitor PalmB may increase the level of palm-Sept8-204, indeed, the incubation of PalmB significantly augments the level of palm-Sept8-204 in ZDHHC17-KO cells (Figure <ref type="figure">3I,</ref><ref type="figure">J</ref>). Dynamically, the large puncta in ZDHHC17-KO is turning into small sized vesicle-like structure upon the treatment of PalmB (Figure <ref type="figure">3K,</ref><ref type="figure">L</ref>).

Moreover, the loss of PPT1 increases the level of palm-Sept8-204 (Figure <ref type="figure">4C,</ref><ref type="figure">D</ref>). Plus, the IP experiment suggested that PPT1 precipitates with Sept8-204/Sept5 (Figure <ref type="figure">4E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>). These data supported that PPT1 catalyzes the depalmitoylation of Sept8-204. Next, we thought to test whether palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP might alter Sept8-204 palmitoylation in PPT1-KO cells. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> ABE results showed that 2-BP treatment again significantly downregulates the level of palm-Sept8-204 in N2a/PPT1-KO cells (Figure <ref type="figure">4G,</ref><ref type="figure">H</ref>). Consequently, small sized vesicle-like structure in PPT1-KO cells transforms into large puncta upon the treatment of 2-BP (Figure <ref type="figure">4I,</ref><ref type="figure">J</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">| Sept8-204 palmitoylation dynamically modulates the colocalization of vesicle-like structure with SYP</head><p>Sept8 and Sept5 were suggested to be involved in neuronal exocytosis, whereby they colocalize with SYP and Syntaxin1A. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> To determine whether the palmitoylation of Sept8-204 is required for this process, we transfected Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha or Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha with OFP-SYP (C-terminal orange fluorescent protein) in N2a cells and the results showed that Sept8-204/Sept5 (form small vesicle-like structure) induced vesicle colocalizes well with SYP (colocalization rate, 84.13%), while that of the Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5 with SYP is about 11.86% (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A-C</ref>). In parallel, loss of ZDHHC17 decreases the level of palm-Sept8-204 (Figure <ref type="figure">3E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>) and thus keeps the low colocalization rate of Sept8-204/Sept5 (form large puncta) with SYP (17.24%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5D</ref> upper, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>). Critically, upregulated level of palm-Sept8-204 (Figure <ref type="figure">3I</ref>,J) induced by PalmB in N2a/ZDHHC17-KO cells dramatically enhances the colocalization rate of Sept8-204/Sept5 with SYP (63.49%) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5D</ref> under, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5F</ref>). Consistently, these findings are in line with the coprecipitation results (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5G-J</ref>). Together, the above data revealed that modulating Sept8-204 palmitoylation dynamically regulate the colocalization of vesicle-like structure with SYP.</p><p>To investigate whether Sept8-204 palmitoylation is involved in regulating the colocalization of vesicle-like structure with endogenous SYP, Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha or Flag-Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5-Ha were expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. The imaging data showed that Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5-Ha is enriched in SYP-positive signal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>, upper panel and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6D</ref>, and Supporting Information S1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>) and show small vesicle-like structure and nice colocalization (75.00%), while Flag-Sept8-204-3CA, or Flag-Sept8-204/Sept5 treated with 2-BP, mainly retains within the soma as large puncta and is largely no longer colocalized with SYP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>-C and Supporting Information S1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>). Next, to test whether KClinduced the firing of action potentials in neurons may be relevant for such cellular phenomenon, KCl (55 mM) was used to treat cultured hippocampal neurons and the results showed that KCl-induced depolarization decreased the palmitoylation level of Sept8-204 in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6E,</ref><ref type="figure">F</ref>). Consequently, Sept8-204/Sept5 induced vesicle-like structure transforms into large puncta in the soma of neurons when treated with KCl (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6G-I</ref>). Furthermore, to assess whether endogenously-expressed Sept8-204 may have similar behavior, cultured hippocampal neurons were used. The corresponding results showed that scattered Sept8 is tending to accumulate into larger aggregates (Supporting Information S1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>), partially mimics the behaviors illustrated in ectopically expressed conditions when palm-Sept8 is downregulated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| DISCUSSION</head><p>Previous studies suggested that Sept8 partners with Sept5, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> the proper cellular localization of Sept8 and Sept5 requires concomitant expression of both proteins and coexpression of Sept8/Sept5 results in both proteins targeted to a vesicle-like location. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> By analyzing Sept8 variants, Sept8-201 and Sept8-204 were found highly expressed in the mouse brain (Supporting Information S1: Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>). Consistently, our immunofluorescence experiments confirmed that the coexpression of Sept8-204 and Sept5 could form vesicle-like structures in N2a (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), as shown in previous reports. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> While the coexpression of Sept8-201/Sept5 or Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5 forms large puncta (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), a phenomenon that has not been reported. Furthermore, it was revealed that dynamic palmitoylation of Sept8-204, maintained by ZDHHC17 and PPT1, is essential for the transformation of vesicle-like structure either large or small (Figures <ref type="figure">3</ref> and<ref type="figure">4</ref>). Nevertheless, here we uncovered a mechanism in N2a cells that the expression of transcriptional variants of Sept8 (Sept8-201 or Sept8-204) and Sept5 produce different sized vesicle-like structure, which is controlled by protein palmitoylation of Sept8-204.</p><p>Various lines of evidence showed that both Sept8 and Sept5 locate in the presynaptic membrane and have been shown to interact with VAMP2, syntain-1 of SNARE complex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Moreover, Sept8 promotes the release of VAMP2 form SYP during action potential stimulation and enhanced docking of vesicles to presynaptic membrane, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> while Sept5 negatively regulate synaptic vesicle release at presynaptic membrane. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Indeed, small size vesicle-like structure induced by the expression of Sept8-204/Sept5 colocalizes with SYP, a marker of synaptic vesicles, in neuronal branches, indicating that small size vesicle-like structure may be involved in modulating the dynamics of synaptic vesicles. Consistently, the application of KCl (55 mM) to induce the firing of action potentials significantly downregulates the level of Sept8-204 palmitoylation and therefore may alter the localization, size, as well as physiological function of vesicle-like structure in cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). Similarly, inhibiting Sept8 palmitoylation by 2-BP or the expression of Sept8-204-3CA/Sept5 in cultured hippocampal neurons produces large puncta, which mainly resides in the soma of cell body (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). These data suggested that Sept8-204/ Sept5 colocalize with SYP and may have functional relevance in the firing of action potentials. Indeed, a recent study reported that palmitoylation of Sept8 goes up with chemical long-term potentiation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> implying that Sept8 palmitoylation is closely associated with neuronal activities.</p><p>It should be noted that the deletion of ZDHHC17 does not completely abrogate the level of palm-Sept8-204, and the facts that palmB or 2-BP can further modulate Sept8-204 palmitoylation in ZDHHC17-KO or PPT1-KO cells, suggesting that other unknown palmitoyltransferases or thioesterases may also be involved in regulating the dynamicity of palm-Sept8-204. Indeed, in a different study where it was reported that multiple ZDHHCs can enhance the level of palm-Sept8-204, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> extending the evidence that the regulation of the homeostasis of Sept8-204 palmitoylation is likely important and complicated in neurons.</p><p>Collectively, here we showed that palmitoylation is essential for Sept8-204 and Sept5 to form vesicle-like structure and distribute along neuronal branches, where they colocalize with SYP. In the firing of action potentials, Sept8-204 palmitoylation is downregulated and may result in the relocation of vesicle-like structure into the soma of neural cells. Our study implicated that dynamic Sept8-204 palmitoylation and Sept5 may play important roles in modulating the activity of action potentials. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>F I G U R E 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The coexpression of Sept8 variants with Sept5 result in divergent size of vesicle-like structure.
