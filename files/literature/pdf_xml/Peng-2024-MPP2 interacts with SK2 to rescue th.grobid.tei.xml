<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Aims:</head><p>The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays an integral role in anxiety disorders (such as post traumatic stress disorder) stem from dysregulated fear memory. The excitability of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA correlates with fear memory, and the afterhyperpolarization current (I AHP ) mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel subtype 2 (SK2) dominates the excitability of glutamatergicneurons. This study aimed to explore the effect of MPP2 interacts with SK2 in the excitability of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA and the extinction of conditioned fear in mice.</p><p>Methods: Fear memory was analyzed via freezing percentage. Western blotting and fluorescence quantitative PCR were used to determine the expression of protein and mRNA respectively. Electrophysiology was employed to measure the excitability of glutamatergic neurons and I AHP .</p><p>Results: Fear conditioning decreased the levels of synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA, which were restored following fear extinction. Notably, reduced expression of synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA during fear conditioning was caused by the increased activity of protein kinase A (PKA), while increased levels of synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA during fear extinction were mediated by interactions with membranepalmitoylated protein 2 (MPP2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions:</head><p>Our results revealed that MPP2 interacts with the SK2 channels and rescues the excitability of glutamatergic neurons by increasing the expression of synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA to promote the normalization of anxiety disorders and provide a new direction for the treatment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUC TI ON</head><p>Amygdala is an almond-shaped cluster of nuclei located deeply and medially within the temporal lobes of the brain in complex vertebrates and modulates emotion, mood, memory, and cognition. The basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is divided into the lateral amygdala (LA) and basal amygdala (BA), as one of the main component of the amygdala, plays an important role in the regulation of emotion, memory, and anxiety disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> Altered the excitability of glutamatergic neurons in BLA is surveyed in the pathophysiology of anxiety, depression, memory impairments, and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> Fear memory has attracted much attention because of its close relationship with psychological trauma. In recent years, fear conditioning and extinction have been widely used to assess fear memory, in which foot shock is considered a kind of traumatic stress to acquire fear. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> Understanding the factors that reduce fear memory may help patients with emotional disorders recover their normal lives and reduce the social medical burden. The mechanism of fear extinction is still unclear.</p><p>SK2 channels are well known for their role in glutamatergic function and reducing excitatory drive by augmenting the afterhyperpolarization phase of action potential. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> SK2 channels are one type of SK channel, a group of potassium channels with a conductivity value of only 10-20 ps. Immunohistochemical results showed that the SK2 channel protein was mainly expressed in the BLA, but SK1 and SK3</p><p>were almost undetectable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Ultrastructural analysis showed that SK2 channels localize to the postsynaptic density (PSD) of neuronal dendritic spines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> The SK2 channel specifically mediates medium hyperpolarizing potential (mAHP), which reduces the excitability of neurons through a decrease in the firing rate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> The specific location of the SK2 channel along the neuronal surface is associated with the regulation of mAHP; in addition, mAHP is almost completely produced by postsynaptic mechanisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> Cytoplasmic protein kinase A (PKA) regulates cell signaling and the function of neurons by phosphorylating ion channels. The subcellular distribution and function of the SK2 channel are affected by direct PKA-mediated phosphorylation. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of three serine residues (Ser568-570) in the C-terminal domain of the SK2 channel leads to endocytosis of the synaptic SK2 channel. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> PKA attenuates mAHP, which is specifically mediated by the SK2 channel, by reducing the expression of the SK2 channel at synapses. Membrane palmitoylated protein 2 (MPP2/p55) is a member of the MAGUK family. Membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs) are categorized as scaffold proteins that have many roles in regulating synaptic function and structure and the location and function of synaptic receptors. A recent study indicated that MPP2 and SK2 channels are highly co-expressed in the PSD of dendritic spines on hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. A complex of the SK2 channel (N-terminal) and MPP2 (SH3-GK domain) in the brains of mice was identified. The SK2 channel contribution to synaptic responses was abolished by downregulating MPP2 expression. In addition, the knockdown of MPP2 expression decreased LTP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> Here, we used paired CS-US and CS alone (unpaired US) to establish the models of conditioned fear memory conditioning and extinction. We hypothesized that PKA phosphorylates the SK2 channel, resulting in endocytosis of the SK2 channel and a decrease in its expression at the synaptic, which promotes the fear response.</p><p>During fear extinction, the expression and function of synaptic MPP2 increase, resulting in an increase in the number of postsynaptic SK2 channels, which inhibit the fear response. By studying the expression, distribution, and molecular mechanism of the SK2 channel in the process of fear memory, the results will clarify that the modulation of the SK2 channel is an important neurobiological mechanism for fear memory in individuals with PTSD and provide a target for clinical translation. </p></div>

From the second CS-US, the percentage of freezing in the Fear conditioning group was higher than that in the Control group, and as the number of CS-US increased, the percentage of freezing increased significantly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). Through the contextual fear memory (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>) and cued fear memory tests (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref>) we found that the freezing time of mice in the Fear conditioning group was higher than that of the Control group.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">mally</formula><p>When fear extinction occurred, the percentage of freezing decreased with the increase in the number of CSs, and the difference was statistically significant from 11 to 20 CSs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1F</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Glutamatergic neurons in the BLA are activated during fear conditioning and extinction</head><p>We observed the excitability of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA during fear conditioning and extinction by performing immunofluorescence staining and recording the evoked firing rate and miniature excitability postsynaptic currents. First, we observed the co-expression of c-Fos and CaMAKII protein using immunofluorescence dual-labeling. The co-expression of c-Fos and CaMKIIα proteins was higher in the Fear extinction group than that in the Control group and lower than that in the Fear conditioning group, indicating that the excitability of glutamatergic neurons was increased through fear conditioning and restored during fear extinction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>The percentage of CaMKII-positive neurons among c-Fos-positive neurons in the BLA was more than 80%, which indicated that most of the neurons activated by fear conditioning and fear extinction were glutamatergic neurons (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2A,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>). mCherry-labeled glutamatergic neurons were observed in the BLA by microinjecting rAVV-CaMKIIα-mCherry-WPRE-pA, which contains the CaMKIIα promoter (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2D</ref>). The evoked firing rate of glutamatergic neurons was observed using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. With different injection currents, the evoked firing rate of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA of mice in the Fear extinction group was higher than that in the Control group and lower than that in the Fear conditioning group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2E</ref>). No significant differences were found in the passive membrane properties of pyramidal glutamatergic neurons in the three groups of mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2F</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">| SK2 channels in glutamatergic neurons of the BLA are associated with fear conditioning and extinction</head><p>We first determined the expression of the SK2 channel in BLA glutamatergic neurons by performing immunofluorescence dual-labeling to investigate the relationship between the SK2 channel and glutamatergic neurons. Quantification of the expression of SK2 and CaMKII in BLA neurons showed that more than 80% of CaMKIIexpressing cells colocalized with SK2 + neurons, suggesting that most of the neurons expressing SK2 channel are glutamatergic neurons in the BLA (Figure <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). Then, we explored the expression of total SK2 channels by performing Western blotting and RT-PCR. Fear conditioning and extinction did not affect the expression of the total SK2 channel (Figure <ref type="figure">3B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>). Next, we extracted synaptosome for Western blotting. The expression of synaptic SK2 channels was decreased in mice subjected to fear conditioning and restored in mice in the Fear extinction group (Figure <ref type="figure">3D</ref>). We proceeded to investigate the relationship between the SK2 channel and the excitability of glutamatergic neurons by recording the I AHP mediated by the SK2 channel expressed on glutamatergic neurons in the BLA. The decrease in the average peak amplitude of I AHP was associated with fear conditioning and the partial increase in this current was related to fear extinction, suggesting that the hyperactivation of glutamatergic neurons correlates with fear conditioning and that fear extinction rescues this hyperactivation (Figure <ref type="figure">3E</ref>). Taken together, in the BLA, decreasing the expression and function of synaptic SK2 channels is conducive to fear conditioning, while increasing these parameters promotes fear extinction. Then, we observed the effect of SK2 channels on fear conditioning and extinction by regulating them.</p><p>The SK2 channel activator 1-EBIO (300 ng, 300 nL), SK2 channel blocker apamin (2.5 pmol, 300 nL) and their respective controls were microinjected into the BLA 30 min prior to fear conditioning to regulate the SK2 channel and to further explore its role in fear memory (Figure <ref type="figure">3F</ref>(red)). At 24 h post-injection, mice were subjected to contextual and cued fear memory tests. Neither 1-EBIO-treated mice (Figure <ref type="figure">3G</ref>) nor apamin-treated mice (Figure <ref type="figure">3K</ref>) showed significant differences in fear learning. In the subsequent fear memory test, compared with the DMSO group, the percentage of freezing decreased in the tested mice (Figure <ref type="figure">3H</ref>,I), suggesting that the contextual and cued fear memory of mice in the 1-EBIO group were significantly impaired. In contrast, apamin did not exert a significant effect on contextual (Figure <ref type="figure">3L</ref>) or cued fear memory (Figure <ref type="figure">3M</ref>).</p><p>The mice were randomly divided into 4 groups after fear conditioning to examine the role of the SK2 channel in fear extinction.</p><p>Then 1-EBIO, apamin, and their respective controls were microinjected into the BLA 30 min prior to fear extinction. These mice were then subjected to 20 presentations of sound stimulation (CS) in the fear box (Figure <ref type="figure">3F</ref> (blue)). Compared with the Control group, the percentage of freezing was lower in mice from the 1-EBIO group, but higher in the apamin group, confirming that 1-EBIO was helpful for fear extinction (Figure <ref type="figure">3J</ref>) while apamin prevented fear extinction (Figure <ref type="figure">3N</ref>). These data indicate that the SK2 channel in the BLA indeed plays a key role in fear conditioning and extinction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">| Activated PKA strengthens fear conditioning by phosphorylating synaptic SK2 channels</head><p>We further explored whether phosphorylated PKA was associated with fear memory by regulating the expression of the SK2 channel. First, we found that fear conditioning and extinction did not affect the expression of cytoplasmic PKA (Figure <ref type="figure">4A</ref>). However, fear conditioning increased the expression of cytoplasmic pPKA, which was restored by fear extinction (Figure <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). The PKA activator 8-Br-cAMP (2.5 pmol, 300 nL) or inhibitor Rp-8-Br-cAMP (30 pmol, 300 nL) was microinjected into BLA 30 min prior to fear conditioning to determine whether activated PKA reduced synaptic SK2 levels by increasing SK2 phosphorylation (Figure <ref type="figure">4C</ref>).</p><p>In fear learning, microinjecting 8-Br-cAMP and Rp-8-Br-cAMP into the BLA had no effects on fear conditioning (Figure <ref type="figure">4D</ref>). In We next examined whether the expression of SK2 mediated by activated PKA was involved in fear extinction. Thirty minutes before fear extinction, 8-Br-cAMP, Rp-8-Br-cAMP, or their vehicles were microinjected into BLA of the three groups of mice (Figure <ref type="figure">4I</ref>). We observed the effect of regulating PKA on fear extinction. The activation or inhibition of PKA did not alter fear extinction (Figure <ref type="figure">4J</ref>). We obtained BLA tissues 45 min after fear extinction for Western blot analysis. The injection of 8-Br-cAMP (Figure <ref type="figure">4K</ref>) and Rp-8-Br-cAMP (Figure <ref type="figure">4L</ref>) into the BLA did not affect the expression of synaptic SK2 channels. PKA activation increased the cytoplasmic pPKA level in response to both fear conditioning and fear extinction but did not affect the expression of synaptic SK2 channels. Combined with the molecular results, we speculate that increased expression of SK2 channels by activated PKA may play a major role in fear conditioning, while regulation of PKA to change the expression of synaptic SK2 channels does not play a leading role in fear extinction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">| MPP2 downregulation in the BLA reduced fear extinction by decreasing the expression of synaptic SK2 channels</head><p>According to previous studies, MPP2 is a synaptic scaffold protein located in the postsynaptic density, and the SK2 channel acts by anchoring to the synapse through MPP2. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Therefore, we tested whether synaptic SK2 channels are anchored by the MPP2 scaffold in the BLA. First, in contrast to the mice in the Fear conditioning group, the expression of synaptic MPP2 in the BLA was increased in the Fear extinction group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5A</ref>). We explored whether the SK2 channel interacted with MPP2 in the BLA by performing coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Western blotting with anti-MPP2</p><p>antibody detected a band of the appropriate apparent molecular weight for MPP2 in the BLA sample precipitated with an SK2 antibody, suggesting that the SK2 channel interacts with MPP2 in the BLA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5B</ref>). Next, we used a siRNA targeting MPP2 (siRNA, Gene Pharma, Suzhou, China) to knock down MPP2 expression in the BLA. The PCR results showed that MPP2-siRNA decreased the expression of the MPP2 mRNA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5C</ref>). Thirty hours before fear conditioning, the mice were separately injected with MPP2-siRNA or the NC in the BLA.

On the next day, 40 min before fear extinction, the mice in the MPP2-siRNA group were randomly divided into 3 groups, two of which were injected with 1-EBIO and DMSO into the BLA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5I</ref>). Compared with control subjects, the siRNA group exhibited increased fear response behaviors, as indicated by a greater number of freezing behaviors during fear extinction, and significant activation of the SK2 channel by 1-EBIO counteracted the increase in the fear response (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5J</ref>). At 45 min after fear conditioning or fear extinction, the BLA was extracted and used for Western blot analysis. The siRNA decreased synaptic MPP2 levels in response to fear extinction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5K</ref>). Microinjection of the siRNA targeting MPP2 into the BLA significantly reduced the expression of synaptic SK2 channels in animals subjected to fear extinction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5L</ref>).</p><p>We labeled glutamatergic neurons with the virus rAVV-CaMKIIα-mCherry-WPRE-pA (Red fluorescence) to test the effect of MPP2 on glutamatergic neurons through the SK2 channel in the BLA. Then, before observing the evoked firing rate of glutamatergic neurons and the average peak amplitude of I AHP through electrophysiology, we injected the siRNA (Green fluorescence) and NC into the BLA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5M</ref>). The evoked firing rate of glutamatergic neurons in the siRNA group was higher than that in the Control group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5N</ref>), and the average peak amplitude of I AHP of glutamatergic neurons in the siRNA group was lower than that in the Control group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5O</ref>). This result suggested that MPP2 knockdown increased the activity of glutamatergic neurons by decreasing the expression and function of synaptic SK2 channels. In conclusion, in the BLA, MPP2 interacts with the SK2 channel, thereby decreasing the activity of glutamatergic neurons to enhance fear extinction, but it does not play a major role in fear conditioning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| DISCUSS ION</head><p>In the present study, we provided novel evidence that synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA are involved in the formation and extinction of fear in mice by mediating the excitability of glutamatergic neurons. The important neural structure involved in PTSD is part of the limbic system, an important region for emotion processing in humans and animals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> In individuals with PTSD, the amygdala, hippo- memory and receives neural projections from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> In the present study, the excitability of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA was significantly increased during fear conditioning and extinction, while the excitability of glutamatergic neurons in the BLA was lower during fear extinction. Based on these results, glutamatergic neurons in the BLA are hyperactivated during fear conditioning and must be excited to produce associative memory. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> The explanation for the lower excitability of fear extinction may be due to the inhibitory effect of the new associative memory on fear memory or the low activation of neurons required for the generation of a new associative memory. Inhibiting the excitability of glutamatergic neurons in BLA using chemogenetics and optogenetics weakened cued and contextual fear memory, consistent with the results reported by Sengupta. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Inhibiting the excitability of BLA glutamatergic neurons during fear extinction may cause changes in the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in the mPFC-BLA pathway, which is beneficial to fear extinction by inhibiting the hyperexcitability of glutamate neurons induced by fear conditioning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> As a key regulator of amygdala neuronal excitability, we speculated that synaptic SK2 channels participate in the regulation of glutamatergic neuronal excitability in the BLA by mediating mAHP. SK channels are located in the postsynaptic membrane of glutamatergic neurons close to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), where they are activated by NMDAR-mediated Ca 2+ influx. Opening of the SK channel induces K + efflux which alters the membrane potential. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> Furthermore, K + efflux and SK channel-mediated reduction of [Ca 2+ ] create a local current that re-establishes NMDA receptor blockade by Mg 2+ , thereby preventing re-excitation of the neurons. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> The SK2 channel might modulate the excitability of neurons in the BLA by affecting NMDARs. In addition, recent studies have examined the role of SK channels in serotonergic neurons in model systems of mood disorders such as depression. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> Further studies are needed to explore how SK2 channels regulate the excitability of neurons in the BLA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Specifically</head><p>We also explored the mechanisms underlying the roles of synaptic SK2 channels in fear conditioning and extinction. The cytoplasmic pPKA level in the BLA was increased in response to fear conditioning and restored by fear extinction. Then, we perceived that the regulation of PKA was important to the expression of synaptic SK2. Indeed, in fear conditioning PKA activation significantly reduced the synaptic SK2 channel abundance, while PKA inhibition significantly increased the synaptic SK2 channel abundance and fear memory. Therefore, we speculated that PKA activation was involved in the decrease in synaptic SK2 channels in the BLA through phosphorylation and the process of synaptic SK2 channel endocytosis in fear conditioning. As the fear response seems to have reached its peak, further activation of PKA did not significantly increase the fear response. In the BLA, activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway is involved in memory consolidation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> Therefore, PKA agonists may activate other pathways (cAMP-PKA) while promoting the depression of the SK2 channel. Thus, the mechanism by which SK2 mediates fear conditioning is a decrease in the expression of synaptic SK2 induced by cytoplasmic PKA-mediated phosphorylation. However, the mechanism did not have an important function in fear extinction.</p><p>Furthermore, we identified a major role for MPP2 in regulating the expression of synaptic SK2 channels during fear extinction. In the BLA, the SK2 channel interacts with MPP2. Knockdown of MPP2 decreased the expression of synaptic SK2 in the BLA and reduced fear extinction. However, MPP2 knockdown did not significantly affect fear memory during fear conditioning. These results supported the view that fear extinction is a new process of associative memory formation, rather than the destruction of the original fear memory.</p></div>

The cDNA products were used as templates for real-time PCR analysis to measure SK2 or MPP2 expression using SK2-specific primers (Sheng-gong, China) or MPP2-specific primers (Sheng-gong, China). Sense and antisense primers were selected to be located on different exons to avoid false-positive results caused by genomic DNA contamination.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_7"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, the regulation of synaptic SK2 by PKA participates in the coding of fear memory (CS-US), while MPP2-mediated changes in synaptic SK2 expression and function play a role in the coding of fear memory extinction (CS-No US). The models of fear conditioning and extinction are often used to explore the mechanism of anxiety disorders (such as PTSD). Fear conditioning induced by multiple pairs of CS-US caused mice to acquire associative fear memory. Then, many CS (No US)-mediated fear extinctions caused the mice to form a new associative memory. Generalization of fear memory and fear extinction disorder are the main symptoms and pathogeny of PTSD. Therefore, studies aiming to discover the factors that enhance or impair fear memory and fear extinction is conducive to exploring the pathogenesis of PTSD and providing new targets for the treatment of PTSD.</figDesc></figure>
