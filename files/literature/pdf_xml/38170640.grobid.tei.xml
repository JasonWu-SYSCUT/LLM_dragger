<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Protein S-acylation is an important lipid modification characteristic for heterogeneity in the acyl chain and dynamicity in the acylation/deacylation cycle.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The acylation of cysteinyl residues with fatty acids, termed S-acylation, is a typically reversible lipid modification and is dynamically mediated by the opposing actions of palmitoyl acyltransferases and acyl protein thioesterases. Protein S-acylation plays a key role in membrane localization and protein trafficking, interactions, stability and conformation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> thus participating in processes such as immune response, oxidative stress, and synaptic plasticity, and linking with diseases, such as tumours and neurological disorders. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> There are two main categories of analytical approaches developed in S-acylproteomics: 3 cysteine-centric and palmitatecentric methods. In cysteine-centric methods, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> cys-palmitoyl thioester linkages are selectively cleaved by neutral hydroxylamine (HA) following the blockage of free thiols, newly exposed thiols are then captured by thiol-active reagents. Although such methods are promising for capturing the entire S-acylproteome in all types of biological samples, they fail to characterize the site-specific modified lipid moiety owing to the HA-treatment and inevitably suffer from a high rate of false positives caused by the incomplete blockage of free cysteines <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> or other non-S-acylated but thioester-modified proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> In palmitate-centric methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> (or the metabolic labelling of palmitate acid analogue, followed by click chemistry, MLCC), S-acylated proteins are metabolically labelled with azido-or alkyne-fatty acid probes and reacted with functionalized biotin using click chemistry, followed by further affinity enrichment. Owing to the strong hydrophobicity of the attached lipid moieties and conjugated biotin groups, which were very challenging for LC-MS analysis, existing MLCC methods generally identify S-acylated proteins via their nonmodified peptides. They usually cannot directly identify S-acylated sites unless they are integrated with HA-selectivity and site-specific thiol labelling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> Therefore, such methods fail to distinguish nonspecific adsorption on enrichment matrixes and other types of acylated proteins (e.g., N-and O-acylation), <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> resulting in false-positive results and requiring quantification proteomics to verify putative S-acylated proteins.</p><p>It has been reported that the types of attached fatty acids 10 as well as modification states (acylated or deacylated) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> could regulate the functions of S-acylated proteins. Therefore, it is vital to unravel S-acylated proteins precisely and multidimensionally. Although commonly known as S-palmitoylation for the predominant form of attached palmitoyl chain, S-acylation is heterogeneous in the acyl chain varying from chain length to saturation. However, there is still no report on the global characterization of intact S-acylated peptides from complex biological samples using these two categories of approaches, resulting in missing information about the attached fatty acids in the S-acylated proteome. The S-acylation heterogeneity was often mapped solely after HA treatment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> in which information about the modification site is actually missing. Recently, we proposed a method, nanographite fluoride-based solid-phase extraction (nGF-SPE), <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> to enrich and perform the first global profiling of endogenously intact S-acylated peptides, enabling simultaneous characterization of the modification sites and their site-specific lipid moieties in protein S-acylation. However, the study on S-acylation turnover could be achieved only by metabolic labelling coupling with pulsechase experiments, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> while it is limited at the protein level, but not the peptide/site level, as well as missing information about the type of attached fatty acids. Therefore, more versatile methods should be further developed for the precise and comprehensive analysis of protein S-acylation.</p><p>Herein, aiming to site-specifically profile both heterogeneity and turnover of S-acylation, we first developed a sitespecific method, ssMLCC, for precise profiling of the S-acylated proteome based on intact S-acylated peptide analysis by introducing an acid cleavable bioorthogonal tag (az-DADPS-biotin) into the metabolic labelling method. The cellular proteins were first metabolically labelled with alkynyl palmitic acid, followed by conjugating with az-DADPS-biotin and digestion. The intact S-acylated peptides were selectively purified via biotin-avidin interaction and released in FA conditions. Finally, intact S-acylated peptides were directly analysed by LC-MS/MS. Consequently, the modification sites and the form of the attached fatty acyl chain can be simultaneously characterized. Therefore, we evaluated the feasibility of az-DADPS-biotin in S-acylproteomics by testing the stability of S-palmitoylated peptides under cleavage conditions and its capability to capture alkynyl peptides. We also compared three release buffers to better recover hydrophobic intact S-acylated peptides. Consequently, intact S-acylated peptide analysis was first achieved using a palmitate-centric strategy, helping for precise mapping of S-acylated sites, and circumventing false positive in previous studies. More importantly, considering the nature of S-acylation heterogeneity and metabolic labelling, all S-acylated peptides modified by different types of fatty acids were characterized by an open search. Thus, site-specific profiling of the acyl chain heterogeneity in protein S-acylation was further achieved. To clearly demonstrate the acyl chain heterogeneity and advantages of our strategy, in our study, S-palmitoylation referred particularly to the thioesterification in cysteine by palmitic acid (C16:0 or alk-C16:0), while S-acylation was a collective name for the acylation of cysteinyl residues with various types of fatty acids. For the turnover study, we next combined the ssMLCC strategy with the pulsechase experiment. By quantitating intact S-acylated peptides under different conditions, we provided the first insight into the dynamic event on S-acylated sites at the proteome level. In this way, a precise and comprehensive analysis of the S-acylated proteome was carried out to further understand the complexity of protein S-acylation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Database search and quantification</head><p>To identify S-palmitoylated peptides, a restricted database search was performed on PEAKS ONLINE using the human Swiss-prot database (reviewed on 26 th , Nov. 2022). Mass tolerances were set at 15 ppm for the parent ions and 0.05 Da for the fragments. Trypsin was set as a specific protease, allowing for three missed cleavages. To identify 17-ODYA-labelled peptides, a restricted database search was carried out with variable modifications containing 17-ODYA (C) (+405.335530 Da, 17-ODYA plus a remaining fragment-143 Da), N-ethylmaleimide (C) (+125.047679 Da) and oxidation (M) (+15.994915 Da). The false discovery rate was restricted to 1% in both protein and peptide identification. For high-confident-modified sites, the minimal AScore was set as 19. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> To quantify S-palmitoylated peptides under three release conditions, defaulted parameters were used in label-free quantification on PEAKS ONLINE. For peptides labelled with other types of fatty acid analogues, an open search was used with the above three variable medications and other unspecified ones, including Alk-18:1(C) (+431.35118 Da), Alk-18:0(C) (+433.36683 Da), Alk-16:1(C) (+403.31988 Da), Alk-14:1(C) (+375.28858 Da), Alk-14:0(C) (+377.30423 Da), Alk-12:1(C) (+347.25728 Da) and Alk-12:0(C) (+349.27293 Da). For pulse-chase experiments, database research was performed on Maxquant (version 2.2.0.0) using the label-free MaxLFQ algorithm with no normalization. The same variable modifications and trypsin specificity were set as above for the identification of 17-ODYA-labelled peptides. Match between runs was used with no requirements of MS/MS for LFQ comparisons. The minimum ratio count was set as zero, and the "advanced site intensities" option was switched off; otherwise, the other parameters were set as defaulted. The quantification information of the replicates was calibrated by the overall ion intensities of all peptides. For high-confident modified sites, the minimal score was set as 40 and the localization probability was 0.75. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>The ssMLCC strategy for the precise and comprehensive analysis of S-acylation As we know, the exact form of modified fatty acids has not been characterized by existing cysteine-centric or palmitatecentric methods for the indirect characterization of S-acylated proteins/sites from non-modified peptides or HA-treated S-acylated peptides but not intact S-acylated peptides. To precisely and comprehensively profile protein S-acylation, including acyl chain heterogeneity and turnover, we aimed to analyze intact S-acylated peptides. Therefore, we developed a sitespecific method, ssMLCC, by introducing an acid cleavable bioorthogonal tag into the MLCC method. In this method (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>), the alkynyl palmitate acid analogues were metabolically labelled onto S-acylated proteins. Here, the extensively applied analogue in current MLCC methods, 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA), <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> was used. The labelled proteins were then selectively "clicked" by the acid cleavable bioorthogonal biotin tag, followed by tryptic digestion. The 17-ODYA-labelled S-acylated peptides were selectively purified via biotin-avidin interaction, followed by acid cleavage and further determination by LC-MS/MS. Compared with previous studies (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1 †</ref>), the introduction of acid cleavable bioorthogonal tag enabled both selective purification and efficient LC-MS/MS analysis of intact S-acylated peptides. Therefore, the modification sites and their attached fatty acids could be characterized directly and simultaneously, facilitating the precise mapping of S-acylation. Consequently, acyl chain heterogeneity in S-acylation can be profiled at the proteome level. Additionally, the intact S-acylated peptides were directly characterized by MS/MS fragmentations, so no additional control group experiments were required to distinguish them from background interferences. Furthermore, ssMLCC could be easily integrated with the pulse-chase protocol to site specifically study S-acylation turnover (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>), in which HeLa cells were first pulsed with 17-ODYA for 2 h, followed by being chased with excess palmitic acid for varying time points. Then, intact S-acylated peptides at different time points were enriched and analyzed based on the ssMLCC strategy coupled with label free quantification (LFQ), allowing the dynamic measurement of the S-acylation turnover rate. Therefore, sitespecific studies on acyl chain heterogeneity and S-acylation turnover could be achieved, helping for precise and comprehensive profiling of protein S-acylation.</p><p>To develop the ssMLCC strategy, we first evaluated the feasibility of applying az-DADPS-biotin in S-acylated proteomics. Considering that intact S-acylated peptides were not stable under some conditions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> resulting in fatty acyl loss, the tag should be cleaved under mild conditions so that intact S-acylated peptides can be recovered. The remaining residue on the peptide after cleavage should not influence subsequent LC separation and MS identification. For this reason, we chose the acid cleavable tag, az-DADPS-biotin, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> that contained a dialkoxydiphenylsilane (DADPS) linker, allowing selective cleavage in FA solution. The remaining tag was +143 Da after cleavage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>). Thus, we first investigated the stability of S-acylated peptides under release conditions by incubating an S-palmitoylated peptide standard (GDFC palmitic acid IQVGR, 1232 Da) in 10% FA solution to simulate the release condition from avidin beads. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>, the S-palmitoylated peptides were stable in the FA solution for at least 2 h, which was sufficient to release the peptides from the beads (0.5 h twice in our experiment). Next, to evaluate its capture and release performance for alkyne-labelled peptides, a synthetic alkynyl peptide standard (DGEK pentinoic acid SNGIDR, 1170 Da) was used. Alkynyl peptides were conjugated with az-DADPS-biotin via CuAAC reaction, captured with avidin agarose beads, released in 10% FA solution and finally detected by MALDI-TOF MS. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>, † the alkynyl peptides were efficiently recovered from the peptide solution with a small additional tag (+143 Da). These results suggest that the az-DADPS-biotin probes could be used for the characterization of intact, metabolically labelled S-acylated peptides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance comparison of different buffers for releasing and analysing intact S-acylated peptides</head><p>We then employed the ssMLCC method in HeLa cells, a complex biological sample. As described above, successful 17-ODYA labelling was the first step in our ssMLCC strategy. We first examined the labelling efficiency using in-gel fluorescence imaging. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>, † 17-ODYA could successfully label proteins in HeLa cells, and most of the labelled proteins were HA-sensitive, indicating the predominance of S-acylated proteins.</p><p>Reducing sample loss before MS analysis is crucial to improving peptide identification, especially for low-abundant and hydrophobic peptides, e.g., intact S-acylated peptides. To obtain sufficient dissolution of the 17-ODYA-labelled peptides after release from the avidin beads, we parallelly enriched 17-ODYA-labelled peptides and released them in 10% FA diluted in H 2 O, 4 M urea, and 50% ACN. The recovered peptides were then analysed using a timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer for further investigation of the identification performance. Results of the restricted database search showed that the identification scale of S-palmitoylated peptides in urea buffer was comparable with that in H 2 O buffer, but there were more di-palmitoylated peptides identified in urea (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>), the identification of which was more challenging than that of mono-palmitoylated ones. Moreover, we analysed the distribution of peptide ion intensity and found that the proportion of the null value was reduced in urea compared with that in H 2 O and ACN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>), which was significant for peptide quantification. We further carried out label-free quantification (LFQ) among these three conditions and found that most S-palmitoylated peptides had a higher ion intensity in urea than in H 2 O and ACN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>). However, there was no improvement on the identification scale of S-palmitoylated peptides in ACN even though the proportion of peptides with Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> Stability investigation of the S-palmitoylated peptide standard (GDFC palmitic acid IQVGR) under release condition. The peptides were incubated in 10% FA solution for 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, and 2 h, followed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. If the palmitoyl loss occurred, there would be a peak at m/z of 994 labelled as the asterisk pattern, referring to the depalmitoylated peptides. two palmitoylated sites and null value was improved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). We also observed relatively less specificity in the ACN based on the number of peptides (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref>), which might account for the poorer performance in the ACN. However, owing to the usage of a bioorthogonal tag, the analytical specificity (the percentage of identified S-palmitoylated peptides against total peptides) of this method was satisfactory (&gt;85%). Taken together, we chose 10% FA in 4 M urea as the release condition in further experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Precise profiling of S-acylated proteome using the ssMLCC strategy</head><p>To evaluate the ability of ssMLCC for precise profiling of the S-acylated proteome from complex biological samples, we took S-palmitoylation (C16:0) as an example of its dominance and directly analysed the 17-ODYA-labelled S-palmitoylated proteome in HeLa cells. In the above-mentioned three release conditional experiments (3 runs per experiment, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4 †</ref>), a total of 390 S-palmitoylated sites in 297 proteins were identified (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>) using restricted database search mode, in which the minimal AScore of modification sites was restricted to 19. Of the identified 297 proteins, 93.9% was reported to be S-acylated in previous proteomic studies according to the Swisspalm database, and 81.1% proteins were identified by two techniques (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>). As for the remaining 6.1% proteins, which were identified to be S-palmitoylated in our study for the first time, nearly two-thirds were predicted to be S-acylated, for example, RNF19A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5 †</ref>). Cellular component analysis of all identified S-palmitoylated proteins revealed that they were mainly enriched in membrane-bounded organelles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref> †), such as plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and nucleus. This phenomenon is consistent with the widely accepted view that S-acylation helps proteins increase the affinity of the membrane. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> These results demonstrated the reliability of our data.</p><p>Classic MLCC studies failed to directly distinguish S-acylated proteins from background interferences, which might result in a false positive and required additional two control (DMSO-treated and HA-treated) groups for further verification (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1 †</ref>). In comparison, our ssMLCC method directly identified the S-acylated peptides according to their MS/MS fragmentations, theoretically contributing to improving the identification accuracy of S-acylated proteins. Actually, we found that 71% of the 297 candidate proteins belonged to high confidence hits and 15% were validated targets in previous studies according to the Swisspalm database, the proportion of which were both larger than that in previous MLCCbased studies, referring to 44% and 5%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>). On the other hand, MLCC methods have been used to indirectly characterize putative S-acylated sites by combining them with HA cleavage, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> which nevertheless suffered from false positive problems as well as incompetence for precise characterization of the attached fatty acids. Here, by ssMLCC, these two problems could be circumvented for the direct characterization of intact S-acylated peptides with no need for HA treatment.</p><p>Benefiting from the direct detection of intact S-acylated peptides, the modification sites together with the exact form of lipid species ( palmitoyl chain, C16:0) were first characterized. All 390 S-acylated sites were detected to be specifically modified by the palmitoyl chain. In Swisspalm, only 20.9% of S-acylated proteins in human cells have been identified together with their modified sites. Herein, we identified 231 novel sites in 191 palmitoylated proteins (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref>), and 56 proteins were detected to possess new S-palmitoylated sites. For example, FLOT1 was found to be S-palmitoylated in C17 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7 †</ref>) and C85 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S8 †</ref>) besides the known site C34 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S9 †</ref>). The palmitoylated sites of another 135 proteins were first identified. Taking REEP5 as an example, it belongs to receptor expression-enhancing proteins (REEPs), which are pivotal to the structure and function of the endoplasmic reticulum. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> REEP5 has been reported to be S-acylated by 13 palmitoyl-proteomics in Swisspalm, while we first identified it was palmitoylated at C18 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S10 †</ref>). Therefore, our results could provide brand new information to an existing database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Profiling of acyl chain heterogeneity in protein S-acylation using the ssMLCC strategy</head><p>Heterogeneity of the acyl chain (e.g., chain length and saturation) is an important aspect of protein S-acylation, which has been reported to provide functional and positioning regu- lations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Acyl chain heterogeneity has been mapped solely after HA treatment, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> which nevertheless missed the information of the modification site. Herein, we were able to site specifically profile acyl chain heterogeneity in protein S-acylation. In ssMLCC, 17-ODYA (alk-C16:0) might be desaturated, elongated, or participate in fatty acid β-oxidation like palmitic acid, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> thus generating a diverse group of lipid species (e.g., alk-C16:1, C18:0 and C14:0). What's more, unlike restricted search engines, open search engines <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> have the potential to excavate other protein modifications, including those resulting from probe metabolism, thus facilitating the characterization of S-acylated peptides modified by different types of fatty acids. In this way, we further site-specifically profiled the heterogeneous states of the acyl chain in protein S-acylation based on our dataset of intact S-acylated peptides released in FA-urea conditions.</p><p>As expected, we totally identified 8 types of S-acylated peptides modified by alk-C12:0, alk-C12:1, alk-C14:0, alk-C14:1, alk-C16:0, alk-C16:1, alk-C18:0 and alk-C18:1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). Respectively, there were 2, 4, 59, 5, 355, 75, 10, and 32 modified sites for the above S-acylation forms. Among them, TEAD1 was found to be S-acylated by alk-C14:0, alk-C16:0 and alk-C16:1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S11 †</ref>) in our study, and the two former types have also been reported in previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Besides, alk-C16:0, alk-C16:1 and alk-C14:0 were more abundant, ranking first, second and third, respectively, according to the number of modification sites. Of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, alk-C16 was the most abundant in our results, and it was reported that S-acylation was susceptible to exogenously added fatty acids, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> in our experiment referring to the large amount of alk-C16:0. In addition, alk-C18:1 displayed more dominance than alk-C18:0, and alk-C18:0 was reported to be rapidly converted to alk-C18:1 after uptake. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> To explore different functions of S-acylation modified by different fatty acids, we carried out GO enrichment of four predominant types in our result (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>), including S-myristoylation (alk-C14:0), S-palmitoylation (alk-C16:0), S-palmitoleylation (alk-C16:1) and S-oleylation (alk-C18:1). The results showed that different S-acylation types exhibited various GO enrichment characteristics. First, these four types of S-acylation were commonly enriched in S-acyltransferase activity, organic acid transmembrane transport activity, and so on. Second, some pathways were associated with certain types of S-acylation; for example, S-myristoylation, S-palmitoleylation and S-oleylation were enriched in the regulation of neurotransmitter levels, while the two former types were additionally enriched in extrinsic apoptotic signaling. Third, different S-acylation forms would be significantly enriched in special pathways, such as S-palmitoylation in peptide metabolism, S-myristoylation in protease binding, S-palmitoleylation in regulation of protein localization to microtubule, and S-oleylation in protein stabilization.</p><p>For site-specific S-acylation, we found that the degree of acyl chain heterogeneity varied. Some sites were detected to be selectively modified by one kind of fatty acid, while others were labelled by several forms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>), accounting for 21.9%. The attached fatty acids were heterogeneous in terms of the difference from chain length to saturation. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S12</ref>, † for chain length from alk-C14 to alk-C18, their substrate sites largely overlapped, while they had a smaller overlap with alk-C12. Most unsaturated S-acylated sites tend to be modified by saturated ones. Therefore, by applying our ssMLCC strategy, site-specific information for acyl chain heterogeneity in protein S-acylation was provided.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Site-specific monitoring of S-palmitoylation turnover using the ssMLCC strategy</head><p>Protein S-acylation was typically reversible, and it was reported that the acylation/deacylation cycle in S-acylation might exert important regulation in signal transduction similar to that in phosphorylation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> To further study the dynamic events on S-acylated sites, we integrated the pulse-chase protocols with our ssMLCC method. The HeLa cells were first pulsed with 17-ODYA for 2 h, followed by being chased with excess palmitic acid for 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). In-gel fluorescence results suggested that the labelling signal of many proteins showed a time-dependent decrease during the chase process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13 †</ref>), indicating the dynamic removal of 17-ODYA in these proteins. We took S-palmitoylation (C16:0) as an example again owing to its dominance. Intact S-palmitoylated peptides at different time points were then enriched and analysed using the ssMLCC method coupled with LFQ proteomics. The peptides were identified and quantified using the label-free MaxLFQ algorithm in Maxquant. The retention time, ion mobility and m/z of matched features were stable among experiments with little shift detected for these parameters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14A †</ref>), and the LFQ intensities were reproducible among three replicates, with good performance in pairwise correlation analysis of replicates (Pearson R &gt; 0.99, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14B †</ref>). These results showed that the ssMLCC strategy together with LC-MS analytical conditions, was robust and suitable for the following quantitative analysis of intact S-acylated peptides.</p><p>In total, we successfully identified 452 S-palmitoylated sites in HeLa cells. For samples pulsed with 17-ODYA without chasing by palmitic acid (noted by 0 h in the figures), there were 237 sites containing quantitative information, the number of which was reduced to 166, 82, 64, 29, and 25 after chasing for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>). This tendency is consistent with widely accepted views that protein S-acylation is dynamic cycling <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and MLCC is generally considered to have a preference for S-acylated proteins with rapid turnover. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> Therefore, we provided a simple and rapid nonradioactive assay for site-specific profiling of S-acylation turnover. It should be mentioned that the pulse-chase conditions might not fully reflect the endogenous turnover rate of S-palmitoylation owing to the 17-ODYA resident in cellular lipid pools. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> For example, we observed some sites whose labelled signals kept increasing when the labelling medium was withdrawn for 1 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S15A †</ref>). Thus, the effects of cellular lipid pools should be investigated and considered when studying lipidation turnover.</p><p>According to our quantitative results, most of the S-palmitoylated sites (71/82) showed at least a two-fold decrease when chased for 2 h (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S15B †</ref>), indicating a special subset of rapid-cycling sites. Together with another 14 sites whose quantitative information was missing when chased for longer than 1 h and showed at least a two-fold decrease in 1 h, we defined all the corresponding 79 proteins as rapid-cycling S-palmitoylated proteins. To determine their uniqueness in S-palmitoylated proteins, we carried out GO enrichment analysis of them using all S-palmitoylated candidates in our results as a background. The results showed that they were significantly enriched in the cellular components, including the GTPase complex and cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, as well as pathways related to organic acid transmembrane transport, palmitoylation, synaptic signaling, lipoprotein metabolism and amine metabolism (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>).</p><p>S-Acylation is highly dynamic and has been globally profiled at the protein level, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> with a pool of S-acylated proteins found to be regulated by acyl protein thioesterases. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no report that has studied S-acylation turnover at the site level, which is especially valuable for S-acylated proteins bearing multiple modification sites. Here, we could focus on the dynamic event at a specific S-palmitoylated site. In our pulse-chase experiments, we detected 69 proteins to be palmitoylated at more than one site, ranging from 2 to 4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>). Moreover, 27 of them held an exact site-specific turnover profile with at least one quantitative information in six pulse-chase experiments (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> †). For a specific multi-palmitoylated protein, the dynamic profiles of different sites generally displayed distinct patterns, reflected by differences in probe incorporation efficiency and turnover rate. For example, we found that the 17-ODYA-labelling signals and decay tendency were different in the two modification sites of PGK1 on C50 and C316 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref>). Rarely, the dynamic profiles of two adjacent sites C289 and C291 in SLC39A8 were similar in both intensity and decay tendency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E</ref>). HRAS is a well-studied S-acylated protein, reported to be rapidly cycling, with palmitate removal rates of about 1 h. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> Herein, a more detailed profiling of S-palmitoylation turnover in HRAS was provided. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6F</ref>, the dynamic profiles of three sites (C118, C181 and C184) were distinctly varied. C181 and C184 were rapidly cycling at different patterns, while C118 was relatively stable. Therefore, our ssMLCC could provide more detailed information for protein S-acylation analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of the S-palmitoylated proteome in HeLa cells</head><p>S-Palmitoylation is a predominant and representative form of S-acylation. Combining all experiments in this study, we identified 606 S-palmitoylated sites from 441 proteins, with 29 novel proteins and 408 novel sites according to Swisspalm, which greatly supplement the existing database. Protein S-acylation is dynamically regulated by the writer palmitoyl acyltransferases and eraser acyl protein thioesterases, 1 which were also putative substrates of S-acylation according to Swisspalm. Notably, using ssMLCC, we detected 10 palmitoyl acyltransferases and 3 acyl protein thioesterases to be palmitoylated together with their modification sites. In 10 palmitoyl acyltransferases, there were 19 palmitoylated sites including 5 active sites in conserved DHHC motif: zDHHC7, zDHHC9, zDHHC14, zDHHC18 and zDHHC24. Such a phenomenon was consistent with the previous study in zDHHC3. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> For acyl protein thioesterases, the modification sites in ABHD17 proteins (C230 in ABHD17A, C210 in ABHD17B, and C251 in ABHD17C) were identified in our study, which were reported to be S-acylated but had no information about modification sites except for C210 in ABHD17B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> These data helped for further understanding of two categories of enzymes involved in S-acylation.</p><p>It has been reported that palmitoylation of a specific site was determined by the accessibility of palmitoyl acyltransferases to cysteines rather than the sequence motif around cysteine. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> Therefore, there was still no consensus motif found in protein S-acylation, including S-palmitoylation. Consistent with this, we also did not find a consensus motif for S-palmitoylation according to the motif analysis results of 606 S-palmitoylated sites. However, we found that four residues were overrepresented around the S-palmitoylated cysteines, including proline (P), glycine (G), lysine (K) and arginine (R) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S16 †</ref>), among which basic residues have been reported to occur around S-acylated cysteines. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> More studies of proteomics and enzyme-substrate relationship should be conducted to obtain more accurate conclusions for motif analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this work, we developed the ssMLCC strategy for precise and comprehensive analysis of protein S-acylation, in which an acid cleavable bioorthogonal tag was introduced into metabolic labelling methods for direct analysis of intact S-acylated peptides. For the first time, we directly identified S-acylated sites with their site-specific attached fatty acids using a palmitate-centric strategy, enabling precise profiling of S-acylated proteome and circumventing false positive in previous studies. In total, we identified 606 S-palmitoylated sites, including 408 novel sites in 441 proteins that were specifically modified by the C16:0 acyl chain. In addition, other types of S-acylated peptides modified by different fatty acids were further characterized by an open search. In this regard, we provided proteomic profiling of acyl chain heterogeneity in S-acylation including S-myristoylation, S-palmitoylation, S-palmitoleylation, and S-oleylation. The ssMLCC strategy also allowed site-specific measurement of S-acylation turnover for the first time by combining with pulse-chase methods. In this way, we identified 85 rapid-cycling S-palmitoylated sites in 79 proteins related to synaptic signalling and transmembrane transport. Detailed turnover profiling on each site was further carried out for multi-palmitoylated proteins, such as PGK1, SLC39A8, and HRAS. Consequently, our work was valuable for the comprehensive analysis and understanding of protein S-acylation. By treatment under different conditions, it is expected to explore site-specific changes in modification abundance, acyl chain heterogeneity and dynamicity of protein S-acylation, which would facilitate further understanding of the complexity of S-acylation and its possible regulatory mechanism in protein structures and functions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2024 Analyst, 2024, 149, 1111-1120 | 1113 Published on 20 December 2023.
