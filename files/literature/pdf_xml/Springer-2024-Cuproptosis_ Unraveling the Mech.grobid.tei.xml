<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Cuproptosis is a recently identified form of cell death induced by imbalanced copper levels. We aimed to explore the mechanism underlying copper-induced cell death. To achieve this, we surveyed the literature to understand the biochemical implications of cuproptosis in diseases, particularly in the context of cancer. The concept of copper ionophores, such as elesclomol and disulfiram, is highlighted as they elevate intracellular copper levels, triggering oxidative stress and ultimately leading to cell death-a potential avenue for cancer therapy.

Archaeological evidence suggests that its usage dates to 10,000 years ago by ancient civilizations in regions such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, and India <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Copper was not recognized to have a role in the human body until the 19th century <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.

Within the average adult body, copper is present within a range of 50-120 mg, with serum concentrations ranging up to 1.5 mg/L [3]. In the United States, the average daily dietary Cu intake is approximately 1 mg [3]. Copper is essential for human health as it is involved in various enzymatic processes and plays crucial roles in many biological processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Despite supporting vital biologic functions, copper holds a great potential to be toxic and can lead to numerous human diseases once it is dysregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">General Mechanisms of Cuproptosis</head><p>Many different cellular functions require copper, especially as a cofactor in enzymes to catalyze biology reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Therefore, copper is always needed inside a cell at a specific critical concentration <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>. However, if the concentration of copper increases or decreases past the critical concentration, it has been shown to cause cytotoxicity in cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Additionally, cells have natural homeostatic processes and functions that can bring a cell back to equilibrium if there is an accumulation or decumulation of copper in the cell. Current research efforts are trying to understand how to turn off or break through those processes in hopes of initiating cytotoxicity to cause cell death for cancer treatment.</p><p>To initiate this process, copper must first enter the cell. This can be carried out by copper ionophores which are small molecules that copper binds to be transported into the cell <ref type="bibr">[60]</ref>. There are various types of copper ionophores that shuttle copper into the cell. For example, dithiocarbonates, bis(thiosemicarbazone) ligands, 8-hydroxyquinolines, flavones, elesclomol, and disulfiram. Copper ionophores then trigger signaling cascades that are part of the cell death pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>. While the complete mechanism is not well understood yet, it has been pointed out that cells that depend more on mitochondrial respiration, which includes the electron transport chain, are more sensitive to copper ionophores than cells that mostly depend on glycolysis as their main energy <ref type="bibr">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59]</ref>. It is also understood that copper does not target the electron transport chain, but rather the citric acid cycle (CAC), leading to the conclusion that cuproptosis and mitochondrial respiration are linked <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, genetic screenings were performed to identify the pathways associated with cuproptosis. It was concluded that copper ionophores have two targets, FDX1, which codes for a reductase, FDX1, that reduces Cu 2+ to its more toxic form, Cu + , and genes that encode parts of the lipoic acid pathway and protein targets of lipoylation, which are also the key mediators of cuproptosis <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>. Lipoylation is a post translational modification where lipoamide is attached to a lysine residue <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>. If FDX1 and the protein lipoylation process are disturbed, the regulation of copper will be limited; therefore, cytotoxicity of copper can be achieved, leading to cuproptosis. However, the exact mechanism of these genetic encoders and cuproptosis is still being explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref>.</p></div>

This discovery not only emphasizes the potential of cuproptosis as a therapeutic cancer avenue, but it also highlights the tangible progress being made in identifying agents that can effectively target and eliminate cancer cells selectively without harming normal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">[117]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Copper Serum Levels and Cancer</head><p>More recently, there has been ongoing research on the connection between copper and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[118]</ref>. Studies have found that cancer patients have elevated copper levels in both their serum and cancer tissue in a multitude of cancers such as oral, ovarian, gastric, breast, renal, thyroid, esophageal, lung, gallbladder, liver, pancreatic, and prostate cancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In specific cases, such as colorectal and breast cancer, elevated serum copper levels have been associated with cancer staging and progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">[119]</ref>. Conversely, decreased serum copper levels have been correlated with colorectal and endometrial cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In addition, it has been found that when the tumor was removed, the Cu serum concentrations returned to the normal threshold as seen in healthy patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Furthermore, copper's impact on cancer is not limited to its association with serum and tissue levels. It has been found that tumor cells heavily rely on copper for metabolism, and a decrease in or an abundance of copper can have detrimental effects on tumor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[120]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Copper in Wilson Disease</head><p>Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that arises from an endogenous accumulation of copper in the body within vital organs, notably the brain, liver, and cornea <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref>. Symptoms are predominantly linked to the affected areas, presenting as liver-related issues such as vomiting, yellowish skin discoloration, and leg swelling, or neurological symptoms like tremors, speech difficulties, personality alterations, and auditory or visual hallucinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref>. This condition follows an autosomal recessive pattern, impacting approximately 1 in every 30,000 individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">[121]</ref>. The primary factor contributing to Wilson disease is a mutation in the ATP7B gene, a crucial copper transport protein responsible for biliary copper excretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">[122]</ref>. Mutations in this gene result in the abnormal accumulation of copper in both the liver and brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Compared to many neurogenetic diseases, Wilson disease responds well to treatment during both its acute and chronic stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">[123]</ref>. Treatment is lifelong and patients can anticipate a normal life expectancy. The objective of therapy for Wilson disease is to normalize and reduce the concentration of free copper in serum, accomplished through the administration of copper chelators such as D-Pen and trientine <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">[124]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.">Copper in Menkes Disease</head><p>Menkes disease is a lethal X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of copper <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[125]</ref>. Initially documented in 1962, this condition now impacts 1 in every 35,000 live male births <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[126,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">127]</ref>. It originates from a mutation in the ATP7A gene, a crucial regulator of copper metabolism in the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">[128]</ref>. The gene is responsible for facilitating the efflux of copper from absorptive cells, but its dysfunction results in a deficiency of this essential mineral <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129]</ref>. Menkes disease presents itself with various symptoms, including weakened bones, seizures, kinky hair, and slow physical development <ref type="bibr" target="#b127">[129]</ref>. Unfortunately, this rare disease often leads to early childhood mortality. While treatment options exist, such as daily copper injections administrated shortly after birth, there is still difficulty in achieving early diagnosis due to the subtle clinical features and the lack of specific biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">[130]</ref>. Currently, a definitive cure for Menkes disease remains elusive. However, early intervention with copper-histidine treatment shows promise in ameliorating some of the neurological symptoms associated with the condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">[125]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Targets and Biomarkers</head><p>As research on copper ionophores is ongoing, there are yet to be specific biomarkers that have been identified. However, there are proteins that serve as potential biomarkers. These proteins include chaperone proteins (Section 4.1), membrane proteins (Section 4.2), and intracellular proteins (Section 4.3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Copper Chaperone Protein Biomarkers</head><p>Copper chaperones are another type of copper transporters. Their role is to ensure the safe handling and delivery of potentially toxic copper ions to a variety of copper proteins that are essential for copper metabolism. There are various copper chaperones, but some essential ones are ATOX1, CCS, COX17, COX11, and SCO1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">132]</ref>. First, ATOX1 binds to Cu + and associates with ATP7A and ATP7B, which makes it part of the copper metalation pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131]</ref>. Copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) is another copper chaperone, and it is responsible for forming heterodimers with copper-zinc superoxide dismutase <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">[133]</ref>. Tests have revealed that CCS protein concentrations are higher in many cells that are found in copper-deficient mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132]</ref>. Thus, it can be a potential biomarker for copper level status. COX17 is another chaperone for copper and it is widely believed that most mitochondrial copper is delivered by this protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132]</ref>. COX17 is 1 of 30 assembly factors necessary for the formation of active cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and is believed to transfer copper from the cytoplasm into mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[92]</ref>. COX11, like COX17, is another copper chaperone which is also 1 of 30 assembly factors for CCO91. COX1, a subunit of CCO, receives most of its copper from COX11. SCO1 and SCO2 are two more copper chaperones that deliver copper directly to the copper-binding site of COX2 and control the homeostasis of copper within cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132]</ref>. When copper enters the intestines, specifically the duodenum, the first transporter it interacts with is CTR1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132]</ref>. It is widely believed that CTR1 is the main protein responsible for the transport of copper across the microvilli layer in the duodenum <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132]</ref>. Through the CTR1 protein, copper can enter the bloodstream and cells. CTR2 is another protein that plays a role in copper import and intracellular copper homeostasis. However, the regulation of copper by CTR2 has not been published yet <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">[132]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Membrane Protein Biomarkers</head><p>Divalent metal transport 1 (DMT1) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>), also known as SLCA112, is a membrane protein that is associated with iron transport; however, it can transport both forms of copper, Cu 2+ and Cu + <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">[134]</ref>. This import of copper occurs under certain conditions, such as a deficiency in CTR1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">[115]</ref>. Another membrane-bound protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>), primarily known for its involvement in neurobiology and neurodegenerative disorders could serve as a potential biomarker for copper ionophores and compels further investigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">[135]</ref>. Given copper's relevance to neuronal function as well as its association with neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to assess if copper ionophores impact APP expression, processing, or metabolism. With its relation to copper, APP is involved in copper homeostasis, and studies have found that an over expression of APP decreases copper levels in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131]</ref>. Experimental studies using cellular models could shed light on more potential connections between copper ionophores and APP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Intracellular Protein Biomarkers</head><p>Intracellular proteins are being explored as potential biomarkers for copper ionophores, revealing insights into the intricate network of copper metabolism within cells. Metallothionein (MT) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>), known for its role in storage and chaperoning, serves as a protein of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">[136]</ref>. MT responds to high copper exposure by enhancing copper entrapment and subsequent loss upon cell shedding in the intestine. Copper triggers MT transcription, but its viability as a biomarker requires further study <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">[137]</ref>. The copper metabolism MURR domain, represented by COMMD1, is crucial for hepatic copper efflux; it is also tightly linked to ATP7B interaction, a copper-transporting protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">[138]</ref>. COMMD1 also interacts with the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), suggesting a greater influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">[139]</ref>. XIAP is essential for COMMD1 degradation as it contributes to normal hepatic copper efflux through its interaction with ATP7B <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">[140]</ref>. Excess copper in the liver accelerates XIAP catabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131]</ref>. Furthermore, COMMD1 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>) expression with changes in copper levels have yet to be studied; further research could offer insights into its potential as a biomarker in copper ionophores <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">[131]</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and Perspectives</head><p>The study of cuproptosis and its potential implications in cancer therapy paves a promising avenue for further research and clinical applications. As research progresses, several key directions can be pursued. Molecules, proteins, and signaling cascades involved in cuproptosis and cellular defense responses against copper-induced damage, as well as genetic and epigenetic factors that could influence one's susceptibility to this novel form of cell death, could be explored. Additionally, to facilitate the advancement of clinical trials and research, the identification of sensitive copper-dependent biomarkers as well as copper ionophore biomarkers becomes crucial <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">[147]</ref>. Exploring the changes in mRNA expression and or the protein abundance of copper transporters in response to dietary copper intake could provide valuable insight for potential biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Moreover, enhancing the selectivity of copper ionophores for cancer cells, as they are currently in the developmental stage for cancer-targeted therapy, holds great potential for improving their clinical efficacy and reducing off-target effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">[112]</ref>. However, before any meaningful progression can occur in linking cuproptosis and copper to targeted cancer therapy, the regulatory mechanisms underlying cuproptosis must be determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Finally, the correlation between cuproptosis and cancer needs further exploration, emphasizing the significance of clinical trials that focus on targeting copper in cancer therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. As the research community aims to understand the intricacies of cuproptosis, its progression holds potential for novel therapeutic strategies that could improve cancer treatment. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
