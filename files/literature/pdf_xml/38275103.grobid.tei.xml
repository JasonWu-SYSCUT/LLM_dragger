<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The intramembrane protease γsecretase has broad physiological functions, but also contributes to Notch-dependent tumors and Alzheimer's disease. While γsecretase cleaves numerous membrane proteins, only few nonsubstrates are known. Thus, a fundamental open question is how γsecretase distinguishes substrates from nonsubstrates and whether sequence-based features or posttranslational modifications of membrane proteins contribute to substrate recognition. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we identified several type I membrane proteins with short ectodomains that were inefficiently or not cleaved by γsecretase, including 'pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1-interacting protein' (PTTG1IP). To analyze the mechanism preventing cleavage of these putative nonsubstrates, we used the validated substrate FN14 as a backbone and replaced its transmembrane domain (TMD), where γcleavage occurs, with the one of nonsubstrates. Surprisingly, some nonsubstrate TMDs were efficiently cleaved in the FN14 backbone, demonstrating that a cleavable TMD is necessary, but not sufficient for cleavage by γsecretase. Cleavage efficiencies varied by up to 200-fold.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">| INTRODUCTION</head><p>Intramembrane proteases have fundamental functions in all kingdoms of life, ranging from membrane protein homeostasis to control of cellular metabolism and the communication between cells in multicellular organisms. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> These proteases cleave their membrane protein substrates within or very close to their transmembrane domains (TMDs) and exist as aspartyl-, serine-or metalloproteases, depending on their catalytic mechanism. Among the aspartyl intramembrane proteases, γsecretase has been studied most intensively, because of its role in Notch signaling during development, in Notch-dependent tumors and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> where γsecretase cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and generates the pathogenic amyloid β (Aβ) peptide. γ-Secretase is a heterotetrameric protein complex consisting of one proteolytically active subunit, presenilin (PS), and three nonproteolytic subunits nicastrin, APH-1 (anterior pharynx defective-1) and presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN-2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> γ-Secretase inhibitors are tested for treatment of Notch-dependent tumors, including desmoid tumors and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Previously, they were also tested for a treatment of AD, but were discontinued because of the occurrence of mechanism-based side effects, resulting from inhibition of other γsecretase substrates, such as Notch and potentially others. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> Beyond Notch and APP, γsecretase cleaves approximately 150 additional membrane proteins. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> Despite this large number, a fundamental open question is to understand which features of a membrane protein distinguish substrates from nonsubstrates, i.e. membrane proteins that are not cleaved by γsecretase or cleaved with low efficiency. Elucidating such features is essential to better understand the mechanism of how substrates among the more than 1000 type I membrane proteins in the human proteome are recognized, bound and cleaved and to potentially enable substrate-specific inhibition of γsecretase for development of safer drugs for AD and other diseases. Some requirements for substrate cleavage by γsecretase are known from the comparison of the known substrates and from mechanistic studies. All known γsecretase substrates are single-span transmembrane proteins with a type I orientation, i.e. an extracellular N-terminus and a cytosolic C-terminus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> γ-Secretase does not cleave with a pronounced sequence specificity, but may rather require structural flexibility within a substrate's TMD. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> Additionally, membrane proteins require a short extracellular domain (ectodomain) to be recognized and cleaved by γsecretase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> This prevents most known γsecretase substrates from being constitutively cleaved, because they have long ectodomains. Before cleavage by γsecretase they need to undergo ectodomain shedding, i.e. truncation of the ectodomain by other proteases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> Otherwise, their cleavage by γsecretase will not take place or only with very low efficiency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> This length requirement is controlled by the γsecretase subunit nicastrin, which has an ectodomain that forms a lid-like structure on top of the active site of γsecretase and thus, prevents cleavage of proteins with long ectodomains. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> As a consequence, most mechanistic studies with γsecretase rely on the use of model substrates with artificially truncated ectodomains. An exception are three recently discovered γsecretase substrates, the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), the TWEAK receptor FN14 (also known as TWEAK receptor, TNR12, CD266 or Fibroblast growth factor-inducible protein 14) and synaptotagmin-7, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> which do not require ectodomain shedding, because they have short ectodomains of 54 (BCMA), 53 (FN14) or 16 (Syt-7) amino acids. The three proteins constitute the emerging subfamily of naturally short γsecretase substrates, which offer the advantage for mechanistic studies that their direct cleavage by γsecretase can be monitored without interference by an initial ectodomain shedding step and that expression of pre-truncated forms of the proteins is not required.</p><p>Yet, a more thorough comparison of the features that distinguish substrates from nonsubstrates does not only require a list of validated substrates but also a list of Other TMDs, including that of PTTG1IP, were still barely cleaved within the FN14 backbone. Pharmacological and mutational experiments revealed that the PTTG1IP TMD is palmitoylated, which prevented cleavage by γsecretase. We conclude that the TMD sequence of a membrane protein and its palmitoylation can be key factors determining substrate recognition and cleavage efficiency by γsecretase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>| 3 of 17</head><p>AßFALG et al.</p><p>proteins that are not cleaved or only with low efficiency. However, while many substrates were identified, only very few nonsubstrates are known for γsecretase, such as integrin β (ITGB1) and natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A). <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> Here, we focused on membrane proteins with naturally short ectodomains. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics we identified and then validated several of them as nonsubstrates for γsecretase, including 'pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1-interacting protein' (PTTG1IP). Because γsecretase cleavage occurs within a substrate's TMD, we generated TMD swap mutants between the validated substrate FN14, which served as a model substrate, and several nonsubstrates. Cleavage efficiency of the domain swap mutants strongly depended on the TMD sequence. Further swaps of N-and C-terminal TMD halves and mutations of individual amino acids as well as pharmacological experiments identified substrate palmitoylation in the C-terminal half of the TMD as a feature that blocks γsecretase cleavage.</p></div>

Cells were incubated overnight in 1 mL DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FCS, containing either 1 μM of the γsecretase inhibitor DAPT (Sigma) or DMSO as control. For palmitoylation inhibition, 50 μM 2-bromo palmitate (Sigma) or DMSO as control were used for overnight treatment. Conditioned media were collected and centrifuged for 1 h at 100 000g and stored at -20°C. Cells were lysed with 100 μL STET (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) buffer containing 1× protease inhibitor (Sigma). The lysate and the correspondingly adjusted volume of conditioned media were loaded on Schägger gradient gels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> For sideby-side loading of lysate and conditioned media, the lysate was diluted 1:100. Detection of overexpressed proteins and their proteolytic products was done with anti-HA.11 (Covance, clone 16B12, Cat MMS-101P) antibody.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">| Conditioned medium enrichment</head><p>Either conditioned medium was directly loaded, adjusted to match the lysate volume, or it was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA-tag antibody.

Subsequently, the immunoprecipitant was eluted in 40 μL of 1× Laemmli buffer in STET through a 10-minute incubation at 95°C. For gel electrophoresis, 30 μL of the eluate (10 μL for FN14) was loaded onto Schägger gradient gels, and detection was carried out using the anti-HA.11 antibody.</p></div>

To establish a reliable baseline, this ratio was further normalized to the corresponding FN14 ratio, serving as a control for each blot. Finally, the logarithmic values of these normalized ratios were plotted, providing a visual representation of the relative cleavage efficiency in comparison to FN14.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">| Mass spectrometry-based proteomics</head><p>Four cell lines, HeLa, MCF7, Jurkat, and U937 were used in mass spectrometry experiments. Cell lines were cultured in T-175 flasks (Thermo). 24 h prior to collection, cells were treated with 1 μM DAPT or DMSO as control. Following number of replicates were analyzed: HeLa (4 DAPT, 5 DMSO), Jurkat (6 DAPT, 5 DMSO), MCF7 (5 DAPT, 5 DMSO), and U937 (4 DAPT, 5 DMSO). Adherent cell lines HeLa and MCF7 were suspended using 1 mM EDTA in PBS. Membrane fractions of the treated cells were collected as described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> In brief, collected cells were homogenized by 27-gauge needle in homogenization buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1x protease inhibitor). Homogenates were centrifuged at 750g for 10 min to remove nuclei, followed by 100 000 g for 90 min to pellet the membrane. Membrane pellets were washed in 100 mM Na 2 CO 3 , and subsequently dissolved by sonication in STET buffer with 2% Triton X-100. The samples were prepared for MS analyses via filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) as described before <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and digested with LysC and Trypsin (Promega, Germany).</p><p>The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with Easy nLC-1000 coupled to Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Scientific) using a NanoFlex ion source equipped with an PRSO-V1 column oven (Sonation, Germany). Fused silica columns (30 cm × 75 μm, New Objective US) packed with 1.9 μm ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ stationary phase (Dr. Maisch, Germany) were used for peptide separation. A binary gradient of water (A) and acetonitrile (B) supplemented with 0.1% formic acid were used (HeLa, MCF7, U937: 0 min., 2% B; 5 min., 5% B; 185 min., 25% B; 230 min, 35% B; 250 min, 60% B; 255 min.; Jurkat: 0 min., 2% B; 3:30 min., 5% B; 137:30 min., 25% B; 168:30 min., 35% B; 182:30 min., 60% B) at 50°C column temperature. A datadependent acquisition method was used. An amount of 1 μg of digested peptide was injected per run. Full MS scans were acquired at a resolution of 70 000 (m/z range: 300-1400, AGC target: 3E+6). The 10 most intense peptide ions per full MS scan were chosen for peptide fragmentation (resolution: 17500, isolation width: 2.0 m/z, AGC target: 1E+5, NCE: 25%). A dynamic exclusion of 120 s was used for peptide fragmentation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">| Mass spectrometric data analysis</head><p>MS results were analyzed by MaxQuant using label-free quantification (LFQ). <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> The data were searched against a one protein per gene canonical human database from UniProt (download: 2022-01-18; 20 600 entries). Trypsin was used as protease. Oxidation of methionines and acetylation of protein N-termini were defined as variable modifications, whereas carbamidomethylation of cysteines was defined as fixed modification. Peptide and protein false discovery rates were set to 1% using the target and decoy approach of Maxquant with a forward reverse concatenated database search. Label-free protein quantification was based on at least one unique peptide. All samples were searched together using separate protein LFQ calculation for the different cell lines.</p><p>Perseus version 1.6.14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> was used for further statistical analysis. Protein LFQ intensities were log2 transformed and a two-sided Student's t-test was applied to identify proteins with a significantly changed protein abundance. Additionally, a permutation-based false discovery rate correction for multiple hypotheses was used applying default settings (p = .05; s 0 = 0.1). <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> For protein categorization, the UniProt subcellular information (download: 2023-05-16) for several organelles and membrane topology was added to the tables.</p><p>For the identification of naturally short transmembrane proteins with a type 1 or 3 orientation and short ectodomains of less or equal 75 amino acids, we used additional information from Uniprot including signal peptides, pro peptides, transmembrane domains as well as other topologic domains. All proteins with an annotated single-pass transmembrane domain but unknown topology were categorized as type 1/3 if the extracellular/ lumenal domain was located N-terminal and C-terminal at cytosol. Single-pass transmembrane proteins with an annotated signal peptide or an annotated N-glycosylation site N-terminally of the TM domain were also defined as type 1/3. Mitochondrial proteins were excluded since γsecretase is not localized in mitochondria The ECD length was calculated, as the amino acids N-terminal of the transmembrane domain subtracting know signal and pro peptides. Finally, 157 proteins fulfilled the set thresholds.</p></div>

To block free cysteine thiols, a 4-h incubation at 40°C was carried out, followed by removal of excess unreacted maleimide through acetone precipitation. The resulting pellet was resolubilized in 600 μL of binding buffer (1% [wt/vol] SDS, 100 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5) at 40°C with continuous shaking. The reaction was divided into three conditions (200 μL each). The first condition remained untreated, the second condition received 200 mM NaCl, and the third condition received 200 mM hydroxylamine sulfate (Sigma). Samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 h to release palmitoylated cysteines. Each condition was desalted using pre-equilibrated Zeba Spin desalting columns (7 kDa cutoff, Thermo Fisher 89 882), and the second and third conditions were immediately treated with 2 mM 10 kDa PEG maleimide (Sigma 63 187). After a 1-hour incubation at 37°C, 30 μL of 4X Laemmli buffer (containing 100 mM DTT) was added, and the reaction was stopped at 60°C for 10 minutes.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">| Identification of naturally short substrates and nonsubstrates of γsecretase</head><p>To identify potential substrates and nonsubstrates for γsecretase, we focused on proteins that have a transmembrane domain of type I orientation and additionally a naturally short ectodomain of ≤75 amino acids in length. The naturally short substrates do not require ectodomain shedding prior to γsecretase cleavage. Thus, upon pharmacological inhibition of γsecretase, the full-length protein form of a naturally short substrate is expected to be enriched in the lysate or membrane fraction of cultured cell lines, similar to the known γsecretase substrates BCMA and FN14, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> which also have short ectodomains. In contrast, the classical γsecretase substrates with long ectodomains, such as APP, are not directly cleaved by γsecretase, but require prior ectodomain shedding, which generates a C-terminal fragment that is the direct γsecretase substrate. As a consequence, inhibition of γsecretase does not increase abundance of the full-length substrates, but only of the C-terminal fragments. Yet, given the low abundance of C-terminal fragments, they are difficult to detect in the presence of full-length protein precursors, as both are digested by trypsin during proteomic sample preparation. Consequently, it is challenging to distinguish whether a tryptic peptide is derived from the full-length protein form or from the C-terminal fragment.</p><p>To identify naturally short substrates and nonsubstrates of γsecretase, we used four human cell lines of different tissue origins, breast cancer MCF7 cells, cervix carcinoma HeLa cells, T cell leukemia Jurkat cells and lymphoma U937 macrophage-like cells. The cell lines were treated overnight with the established γsecretase inhibitor DAPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> or DMSO as a control. The proteomes of membrane fractions were determined by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Protein quantification was achieved using label-free quantification and is displayed in volcano plots as the ratio of the protein abundance in the DAPT versus the control DMSO condition (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Among these proteins, we focused on proteins annotated as type I (with a signal peptide) or type III (without a signal peptide) transmembrane proteins in Uniprot and having an annotated short ectodomain length of up to 75 amino acids, because these may be potential substrates and nonsubstrates for γsecretase.</p><p>Adding additional proteins according to UniProt information on signal peptides and topological domains (as described in the methods section) resulted in a total of 157 naturally short membrane proteins, from which we identified 73 proteins and relatively quantified 68 proteins compared to the DMSO control condition (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Proteins were considered as naturally short substrate candidates for γsecretase, if their protein abundance was increased by at least two-fold (&gt;1.0 on the log 2 scale of the x-axis) and if the change was statistically significant after FDR-correction for multiple hypothesis testing, i.e. if the proteins were above the hyperbolic FDR curves in the volcano plots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>-D and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> for proteomic data). In HeLa cells, this yielded TNFRSF12A (better known as FN14), which is a known γsecretase substrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and validates the screening approach. Additional hits were PTPRCAP and C16orf54 in Jurkat cells, which have been little described to date. C16orf54 has an annotated N-glycosylation site N-terminal of its transmembrane domain, an extracellular domain length of 31 amino acids and is considered as a new naturally short γsecretase substrate. PTPRCAP was not included in our initial list of 157 transmembrane proteins with short ectodomains (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), because it is annotated in Uniprot simply as a single-pass membrane protein without information of it being a type I or II membrane protein. However, based on the topology prediction of the Phobius webserver, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> PTPRCAP is annotated as a type 1 transmembrane protein with a signal peptide of 20 amino acids and an extracellular domain of 15 amino acids. Therefore, we consider it as an additional naturally short γsecretase substrate candidate. In MCF7 cells, FN14 was strongly enriched by 4.1-fold, but this increase did not reach significance upon FDR correction. Syt12 (quantified in HeLa cells) may be an additional naturally short substrate, because its increase was 4-fold and was close to reaching significance after FDR correction (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</p><p>As we were particularly interested in identifying naturally short nonsubstrate candidates for mechanistic studies, we had a closer look at all the type I or III membrane proteins with a short ectodomain that were quantified in at least one of the four cell lines but not significantly changed upon DAPT treatment. Among the 68 membrane proteins quantified in at least one cell line (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), only the above-mentioned proteins FN14, PTPRCAP, and C16orf54 showed clear evidence for being γsecretase substrate candidates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">| Validation of naturally short nonsubstrates of γsecretase</head><p>For validation and further mechanistic analysis, we chose six proteins from the 68 apparent nonsubstrate candidates that differed in the length of their ectodomain and were consistently detected in at least one cell line. FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3 (FXYD3) has a very short ectodomain of 18 amino acids. FXYD6, which has an ectodomain of 17 amino acids, does not have a pronounced sequence similarity to FXYD3 and was included as a comparison to FXYD3. The ectodomain lengths of LYRIC, PMEPA1 and PTTG1IP are 49, 41 and 64 amino acids, respectively. FXYD3 and FXYD6 are auxiliary subunits of the Na,K-ATPase. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> LYRIC (Metadherin; MTDH), PMEPA1 (TMEPAI) and PTTG1IP (pituitary tumortransforming gene binding factor; PBF) have not been studied in much detail, but may modulate multiple signaling pathways and are linked to malignancies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> We also included SYT12, which has an ectodomain length of 19 amino acids and is a homolog of the previously identified  <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> Selected single-pass transmembrane proteins with a FDR-significant fold-change &gt;1 (vertical line) are labeled with their gene names.</p><p>naturally short γsecretase substrate SYT7. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> For SYT12, it remained possible from the proteomics experiment that it may be cleaved by γsecretase, even though its changes in HeLa cells had not reached significance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</p><p>To validate the nonsubstrate candidates, we transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells with plasmids encoding the nonsubstrate candidates. As a positive control for a substrate, we included FN14. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> As a positive control for a nonsubstrate, we included a C-terminal fragment of integrin β1 (ITGB1) carrying 25 amino acids of its natural ectodomain, which was previously established as a nonsubstrate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> All proteins carried an N-terminal HA-epitope tag and a C-terminal double FLAG-epitope tag (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref> for a scheme). Cells were incubated overnight either with DAPT or DMSO as a control. The full-length proteins were detected in the cell lysate with an anti-HA-tag antibody. In contrast to the endogenously expressed short proteins, where DAPT increased protein abundance of FN14 in the proteomic experiment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), this increase was not seen upon overexpression of FN14 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>), in line with our previous study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> Presumably, the transfected protein is much more abundant than the endogenous protein so only a small fraction is processed by γsecretase during the experiment. The full-length proteins were detected with various abundance when the same amounts of total lysate protein were loaded (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>,C, top two panels). Thus, the proteins were additionally loaded on a separate gel with varying protein amounts to better visualize that all proteins were expressed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>,C, third panel from the top).</p><p>Among the two substrate cleavage products generated by γsecretase, the ICDs are short-lived and often difficult to detect. Thus, we used the secretion of the small N-terminal Aβ-like peptide into the conditioned medium as a criterion to classify a protein as a substrate or a nonsubstrate. Given the low expression level of some constructs, the secreted peptide was immunoprecipitated with an HA-tag antibody. As expected for the positive control, DAPT strongly reduced the secreted FN14 peptide in the conditioned medium for the γsecretase substrate FN14 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>), while no secreted peptide was detected for the known nonsubstrate ITGB1, neither under control (DMSO) nor DAPT treatment conditions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). Likewise, no secreted peptide was detected for LYRIC, FXYD3, SYT12, PMEPA1 and PTTG1IP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>), whereas for FXYD6 a shade of a low-intensity band of ~7 kDa was seen that appeared reduced with DAPT, indicating that FXYD6 may potentially be cleaved by γsecretase. We conclude that these six proteins are either nonsubstrates or cleaved with low efficiency, which is in line with the proteomic result that the abundance of these proteins -even at endogenous expression -was not significantly increased upon DAPT treatment in the membrane fraction of the cultured cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>γ-Secretase cleaves its substrates at the plasma membrane and in the endocytic pathway. To ensure that the overexpressed proteins would traffic through the secretory pathway, we used flow cytometry to verify that all expressed proteins were detected at the cell surface with an anti-HA-tag antibody, as compared to an isotype control antibody (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>).</p><p>We conclude that, compared to FN14, the membrane proteins FXYD3, FXYD6, LYRIC, PMEPA1, PTTG1IP and SYT12, which all have short ectodomains, are either cleaved with low efficiency or not at all by γsecretase. Thus, we considered them as nonsubstrates for the subsequent mechanistic study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">| The transmembrane domain sequence determines the cleavage efficiency of substrates</head><p>Because γsecretase cleaves its substrates within their TMD, we asked whether the transmembrane sequence of the nonsubstrates is a determinant that prevents their cleavage. To exclude effects from sequences in the ectodomain or cytoplasmic domain, we used the validated naturally short substrate FN14 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> as a model substrate and replaced only its TMD with the ones from the validated nonsubstrate proteins (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). These FN14 TMD swap constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells. We also included the TMDs of three known γsecretase substrates with long ectodomains -APP, Notch1, CACHD1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> -to be able to compare the cleavage efficiencies of the nonsubstrate TMDs to some known substrate TMDs. As negative controls we included the TMDs of the nonsubstrate ITGB1 and a synthetic TMD consisting of 21 leucines (poly leucine 21, pL21, same number of amino acids as in the FN14 TMD), which has a strongly reduced conformational flexibility and prevents γsecretase cleavage, as shown for the substrate C99. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> Full-length proteins in the lysate and the secreted peptides in the conditioned medium were detected on the same membrane by immunoblot using an anti-HA antibody. Immunoblot intensity of the secreted peptides were quantified and normalized to the intensity of the corresponding full-length protein to control for potential differences in transfection efficiency or protein expression. This ratio (secreted peptide/full-length protein) was taken as a measure of cleavage efficiency of the protein by γsecretase and was set to 1 for wild-type FN14, for which the secreted peptide and the full-length protein were well detectable (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). Cleavage efficiencies for the distinct TMD swap constructs in the FN14 backbone varied by up to 200-fold between FN14 with the TMD of FXYD3 versus PMEPA1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>, and quantification in 3C [logarithmic scale]). The positive and negative controls showed the expected cleavage efficiencies. Specifically, the FN14 constructs with the TMDs of the known γsecretase substrates Notch1, CACHD1 and APP were more efficiently cleaved by γsecretase than the reference construct with the FN14 TMD. As expected for the negative control, FN14 with the synthetic pL21 TMD was barely cleaved and showed the lowest cleavage efficiency of all constructs tested. FN14 with the TMD of the nonsubstrate ITGB1 yielded little of the secreted peptide and showed a low cleavage efficiency compared to the reference construct with the FN14 TMD, consistent with ITGB1 being a nonsubstrate for γsecretase. Among the TMDs of our newly identified nonsubstrates or low-efficient substrates for γsecretase (FXYD3, SYT12, LYRIC, FXYD6, PTTG1IP, PMEPA1), some behaved similar to ITGB1 and showed a much lower cleavage efficiency (FXYD6, PTTG1IP, PMEPA1) than the reference FN14, whereas others were more efficiently cleaved by γsecretase (FXYD3, SYT12, LYRIC) than FN14. All proteins were efficiently expressed at the surface of the transfected HEK293 cells, as seen by flow cytometry (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). Together, these experiments demonstrate that the TMDs of several nonsubstrates can be efficiently cleaved by γsecretase if present within the backbone of a well-cleaved γsecretase substrate. We conclude that a cleavable TMD is required for cleavage by γsecretase but that the backbone, i.e. domains outside of the TMD, such as the N-terminal ectodomain or the Cterminal cytoplasmic domain, may prevent efficient cleavage by γsecretase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">|</head><p>The C-terminal half of the transmembrane domain determines the cleavage efficiency γ-Secretase cleaves its substrates typically first at the Cterminal end of their TMD and then proceeds in a stepwise manner towards the middle of the TMD, thereby shortening the N-terminal cleavage product until it is short enough to slip out of the membrane. To narrow down which part of the TMDs investigated in our study may be relevant in determining the cleavage efficiency, we focused on the TMDs of FN14 (used as reference), FXYD3 (very efficiently cleaved) and PTTG1IP (poorly cleaved, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>) and exchanged among them either the N-or the C-terminal half of their TMDs. As in those experiments above where complete TMDs were exchanged (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>), epitope-tagged domains of FN14 provided the extracellular and cytoplasmic sequences of these constructs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref> for a scheme). Constructs with the Cterminal TMD half of FN14 showed a cleavage efficiency similar to the entire FN14 TMD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>, quantification in C). In contrast, constructs with the N-terminal TMD half of FN14 showed the cleavage efficiency of the corresponding protein (FXYD3, PTTG1IP) from which the C-terminal TMD half was taken. Likewise, the chimeric constructs with half TMDs from FXYD3 and PTTG1IP showed the cleavage efficiency of the TMD from which the C-terminal TMD half was taken. We conclude that the C-terminal half of the TMDs has a major influence on the cleavage efficiency of the constructs used in our assay and that the PTTG1IP TMD strongly suppresses cleavage by γsecretase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">| Substrate palmitoylation interferes with substrate cleavage</head><p>Comparison of the C-terminal TMD ends in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref> (PTTG1IP, FXYD3 and FN14) revealed the presence of a double cysteine motif at the C-terminal TMD end of PTTG1IP, which is not found in FXYD3 and FN14 and not in the other proteins tested in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Because such cysteine motifs may be modified post-translationally with the fatty acid palmitic acid, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> we considered that such palmitoylation may potentially interfere with γsecretase cleavage. Thus, we tested whether pharmacological inhibition of palmitoylation with 2-bromopalmitic acid (2-BP) or exchange of both cysteines to serines would increase γsecretase cleavage of the FN14 mutant with the PTTG1IP TMD (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). In fact, 2-BP enhanced cleavage of FN14 with the PTTG1IP TMD, whereas it had no effect on FN14 with its wild-type TMD, used as a control (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>). This suggests that the TMD of PTTG1IP, but not of FN14, is palmitoylated and that inhibition of palmitoylation enhances cleavage by γsecretase. A similar result was obtained when membranes from the transfected HEK293 cells were subject to an in vitro γsecretase assay, in which the second cleavage product by γsecretase -the ICD -, can be detected for FN14, in agreement with our previous publication <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). 2-BP enhanced ICD abundance for FN14 with the PTTG1IP TMD, whereas it had no effect on FN14 with its wild-type TMD, that was used as a negative control (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). We also included wild-type, full-length PTTG1IP, but did not detect its ICD, not even after 2-BP treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). Potentially, its ICD was below the detection limit of our immunoblot even upon 2-BP treatment. Alternatively, inhibition of palmitoylation by 2-BP may not be sufficient for cleavage of PTTG1IP by γsecretase, as the N-terminal extracellular domain and the C-terminal intracellular domains of PTTG1IP may additionally prevent binding to or cleavage by γsecretase.</p><p>Next, we replaced both cysteines within the PTTG1IP TMD in the FN14 backbone by serines, which are structurally similar to cysteines but cannot be palmitoylated. This mutant PTTG1IP-SS also enhanced cleavage and did so even more strongly than 2-BP. As expected, 2-BP did not further enhance cleavage of FN14 with the PTTG1IP-SS TMD, because this mutant cannot be palmitoylated within its TMD. We also generated two additional nonpalmitoylatable variants of FN14 with the PTTG1IP TMD, in which the two cysteines were replaced by the hydrophobic amino acids alanine-alanine (AA) or alanine-leucine (AL) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>). Similar to FN14 with the PTTG1IP-SS TMD, both the PTTG1IP-AA and the PTTG1IP-AL TMD variants strongly increased cleavage by γsecretase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>).</p><p>To further demonstrate the relevance of the two cysteine residues, we introduced them at the C-terminal TMD end of the very well-cleaved substrate FN14 with the FXYD3 TMD. Introduction of the cysteines nearly completely blocked cleavage by γsecretase. As a control, addition of 2-BP enhanced cleavage of this mutant protein to an extent similar to what was seen for FN14 with the PTTG1IP TMD upon 2-BP treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B,</ref><ref type="figure">C</ref>). In a control experiment, the mutations still allowed surface expression of the proteins in transfected HEK293 cells (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3B</ref>). As a further control, we also included the two cysteines at the C-terminal TMD end of the wellcleaved substrate FN14 with the TMD of APP. Similar to FN14 with the FXYD3 TMD, the two cysteines nearly completely blocked cleavage by γsecretase, whereas addition of 2-BP enhanced cleavage of this mutant protein to an extent similar to what is seen for FN14 with the PTTG1IP TMD upon 2-BP treatment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</p><p>We conclude that in the constructs tested, a palmitoylation motif at the cytoplasmic end of the PTTG1IP or FXYD3 or APP TMD is sufficient to block cleavage by γsecretase and that inhibition of palmitoylation is a means to increase cleavage of these constructs by γsecretase.</p><p>To demonstrate physical palmitoylation of FN14 with the PTTG1IP TMD, but not of its variant PTTG1IP-SS in the transfected HEK293 cells, we used an established assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> in which the low molecular weight molecule palmitate is replaced by polyethyleneglycol (PEG). Replacing palmitate with the 10 kDa PEG leads to a molecular weight shift that can be detected by immunoblot, as shown previously for calnexin. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> For the replacement, cell lysates were treated with hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH), which removes palmitoylation and makes the resulting free cysteine amenable to modification with PEG in vitro.</p><p>The cytoplasmic domain of FN14, which was used for our domain swap constructs and thus, also of the FN14 chimera with the PTTG1IP TMD, contains naturally two cysteine residues, one of which is just three amino acids downstream of the transmembrane domain (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). One or both of these cytoplasmic cysteines in FN14 may potentially be palmitoylated according to the SwissPalm database <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> and could, thus, possibly interfere with detection of palmitoylation within the TMD of FN14-PTTG1IP. To exclude this possibility, we mutated both cysteines in the cytoplasmic domain of FN14 to alanine (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>) and verified that both cysteine mutations outside of the TMD did not affect the cleavage by γsecretase of all constructs used for the palmitoylation detection assay (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>). In the palmitoylation assays, the TMD of FN14 was indeed not palmitoylated, whereas the TMD of PTTG1IP, but not of the PTTG1IP-SS variant, was inferred to be palmitoylated (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>) based on the molecular weight shift induced by modification with PEG. The extent of the molecular weight increase indicates that only one of the two cysteines in the TMD was palmitoylated. Similar results were obtained for FXYD3, which was palmitoylated only when carrying the di-cysteine palmitoylation motif. As a positive control, calnexin was detected as being palmitoylated in each sample (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>).</p><p>Taken all together, we conclude that palmitoylation within a substrate's TMD can be a mechanism to reduce the extent of substrate cleavage by γsecretase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">| DISCUSSION</head><p>Our study identified new substrate candidates and putative nonsubstrates for γsecretase and demonstrates that the TMD sequence of membrane proteins and their palmitoylation are key features for substrate recognition and cleavage efficiency of γsecretase.</p><p>Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification that is found in approximately 10% of the human proteome. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> Protein acyl transferases covalently link the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues of cytosolic and transmembrane proteins, whereas acyl protein thioesterases can remove this modification. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> Palmitoylation can affect cellular localization and function of membrane proteins, such as the signaling of surface receptors or the activity of the protease BACE1, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> but in many cases, the exact role of palmitoylation is not yet understood. Palmitoylation of transmembrane proteins occurs within their cytoplasmic domains or even at the cytosolic end of their TMDs. Our study demonstrates that palmitoylation within a substrate's TMD can block cleavage by γsecretase. The model substrate FN14 with the TMD of PTTG1IP was only cleaved by γsecretase when its TMD was not palmitoylated, as shown via pharmacological inhibition of palmitoylation, or when the two cysteine residues at the C-terminal end of the substrate's TMD were replaced by serine, alanine or leucine. Conversely, when this dicysteine-motif was transferred to the same location within the TMD of the well-cleaved model substrate FN14 containing the FXYD3 or APP TMD, it became palmitoylated, resulting in strongly reduced cleavage by γsecretase. Because palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification, it is conceivable that regulated palmitoylation/depalmitoylation controls γsecretase cleavage of some substrates, but at present little is known about such cellular processes or stimuli.</p><p>We consider different scenarios of how palmitoylation within a TMD may interfere with γsecretase cleavage of substrates. This modification may sterically hinder the access of the substrate's TMD to the active site of γsecretase, which accommodates only a single TMD of a substrate, as demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy for γsecretase with substrates derived from APP or Notch. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> It is also conceivable that the palmitoylation may retain the substrate's TMD in the lipid environment of the membrane or tilt the TMD and prevent it from entering the protein environment provided by the multiple TMDs of presenilin, the active site-containing subunit of γsecretase. Additionally, the two cysteines, where palmitoylation occurs in the FN14 substrate with the PTTG1IP TMD, are located exactly at the site where γsecretase would initially cleave its substrate, so that palmitoylation at this site may interfere with the access of the two catalytic aspartates of γsecretase to the scissile peptide bond. Finally, the palmitic acid may interfere with the partial unfolding of the substrate's TMD helix at its C-terminal end which appears to be required for the formation of a stable enzyme-substrate complex needed for proteolysis to occur. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> PTTG1IP is not the only transmembrane protein with a type I-oriented TMD that has a cysteine near the Cterminal end of its TMD. However, not all such cysteines are necessarily palmitoylated or functionally relevant. Among the 149 proteins being reported as γsecretase substrates, <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> 20 carry a cysteine at the C-terminal end of their TMD (Table <ref type="table">S3</ref>), where we considered the last four C-terminal amino acids of the TMDs as they are predicted by the TMHMM algorithm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> This is the region where the initial cleavage by γsecretase typically occurs. It is largely unclear whether these proteins are indeed palmitoylated. Eight of these 20 proteins were found to be palmitoylation candidates in palmitoyl-proteomics studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> but only two of them were experimentally verified (CD44 and TNFRSF21). Five additional proteins out of the eight candidates have cytoplasmatic cysteines distant from the TMD. Thus, even if they can be palmitoylated, it remains unclear whether palmitoylation occurs at the TMD boundary, where it may directly influence γsecretase cleavage, or distant from the membrane, where it might not directly interfere with γsecretase cleavage. In principle, palmitoylation at such distant cysteines outside of the TMD may still influence γsecretase cleavage, but in an indirect manner, as reported previously for the transmembrane proteins betacellulin, p75NTR and the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN1B. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> In those cases, palmitoylation was required for stability or cell surface transport of the transmembrane protein, so that loss of palmitoylation reduced substrate levels or their trafficking towards γsecretase. Additionally, it is possible that for some proteins with cysteines in their TMD only a fraction of their molecules is palmitoylated so that enough nonpalmitoylated molecules are available for cleavage by γsecretase. As a consequence, palmitoylation may not lead to measurable changes in their cleavage by γsecretase. Interestingly, Aph-1 and nicastrin, two of the four γsecretase complex subunits, are also palmitoylated. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> While this modification appears to stabilize the γsecretase complex, it is not required for γsecretase activity.</p><p>Another result of our study is that a cleavable TMD is required for cleavage by γsecretase, but that domains outside of the TMD, such as the N-terminal ectodomain or the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain may prevent efficient cleavage by γsecretase. Several of the membrane proteins with short ectodomains, i.e., FXYD3, FXYD6, LYRIC, PMEPA1, PTTG1IP, SYT12, were found to not be efficiently cleaved by γsecretase in their wild-type forms, as monitored by (a) the lack of the endogenous proteins being enriched upon γsecretase inhibition using mass spectrometry and (b) by the lack of secretion of an Aβ-like peptide upon protein overexpression. Yet, in the domain swap experiments, the TMDs of the nonsubstrates FXYD3, LYRIC and SYT12 were efficiently cleaved by γsecretase when flanked by the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of the well-cleaved γsecretase substrate FN14. A central role for a domain other than the TMD in recognition by γsecretase is in line with previous data revealing that the initial interaction between a substrate and γsecretase involves a substrate's ectodomain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> Our study also highlights that a substrate's TMD sequence -even in the absence of palmitoylation -determines the efficiency with which it is cleaved and processed to the secreted Aβ-like peptide relative to the amount of full-length substrate in the lysate. Using FN14 as the protein backbone, the cleavage efficiency differed by up to 200-fold between the most (FXYD3) and the least (pL21) efficiently cleaved TMD. Similarly, previous studies demonstrated that point mutations in the TMD of the APP-derived substrate C99 can affect total Aβ generation via decreasing the efficiency of γsecretase cleavage and/ or processing of long Aβ to shorter Aβ species. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref> While the mechanism underlying these differences in cleavability is not fully clear, it is possible that the sequence of the C-terminal TMD halves -which showed the strongest effect on cleavage efficiency in our study -differs structurally in its ability and affinity to bind to the active site of γsecretase, thus allowing more or less efficient cleavage. Alternatively, the sequences of the C-terminal TMD halves may differ in their ability to unfold and form a βsheet that is required for the formation of a stable enzyme-substrate complex needed for proteolysis to occur. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> Additionally, a combined experimental approach using cleavage assays, mutagenesis, deuterium-hydrogen exchange analysis and NMR spectroscopy recently uncovered three crucial domains within APP and Notch TMD helices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> A conformationally flexible N-terminal domain may facilitate the passage of the TMD from a bilayer towards the catalytic aspartates of presenilin, the enzymatic subunit of γsecretase. In addition, flexibility may enhance presentation of a C-terminal TMD domain to presenilin domains, with whom it forms a βsheet stabilizing the unfolded cleavage-competent state. In the unfolded state, that domain of the TMD encompassing the initial cleavage site is likely to tightly dock into the catalytic cleft of presenilin.</p><p>Given the wide range of cleavage efficiencies in our study, it appears possible that any TMD sequence may be cleaved and processed to some extent by γsecretase, provided that it is in a type I orientation -which is required for any γsecretase substrate -and that it has permissive extracellular and cytoplasmic domains. However, for some TMDs the cleavage efficiency may be so low -as for example for FN14-PTTG1IP in our study -that they may effectively be considered as nonsubstrates of γsecretase.</p><p>In summary, our study provides new insights into the mechanisms that control substrate recognition and cleavage efficiency by γsecretase. This is not only important for understanding intramembrane proteolysis as a fundamental mechanism in cell biology and cell homeostasis, but may eventually enable the design of new γsecretase-targeted drugs that act in a substrate-selective or substrate-preferring manner and avoid side effects of the currently used γsecretase inhibitors in clinical trials for leukemia and AD.</p></div>

Intramembrane proteolysis by γsecretase would result in the secretion of a HA-tagged fragment into the conditioned medium. (B and C) Lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with putative (non)-substrates of γsecretase were loaded next to each other according to protein amount (Equal amounts, top two panels). Next, loading was adjusted according to band intensity in order to better visualize the constructs (third panel from the top). The generation of a γsecretase cleavage product was measured by immunoprecipitating the conditioned medium (CM) with an anti-HA-tag antibody and loading volumes of the precipitate corresponding to the adjusted lysates. The generation of the Aβ-like cleavage product of FN14 is indicated by a black arrowhead and was detected upon blotting with anti-HA antibody. Representative blots from N = 3 experiments are presented. (D) In order to assess surface abundance of the putative (non)-substrates, HEK293 cells were transfected with the described constructs and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were labeled with HA antibody (blue) to the N-terminal HA-tag of the constructs, or isotype control (red). Shown are representative histograms from N = 2 experiments.</figDesc></figure>

The generation of an Aβ-like cleavage product (soluble FN14 or mutants thereof) is indicated by a black arrowhead and was detected upon blotting with anti-HA antibody. Representative blots from N = 3-5 experiments are presented. For FN14, which served as the reference, N = 42. A dashed line indicates that the samples were run on the same gel, but not directly next to each other.

(A) The schematic overview shows the construct design, where the FN14 construct serves as the backbone with an N-terminal HA-tag (hexagon) and a C-terminal double FLAG-tag (triangle). To elucidate which part of the TMD predominantly affects cleavage by γsecretase, the N-and C-terminal halves of the TMDs of the nonsubstrates FXYD3 and PTTG1IP were inserted into the corresponding positions within the TMD of the model substrate FN14. For example, FN14-PTTG1IP refers to a construct consisting of the N-terminal half of the FN14TMD fused to the C-terminal half of the PTTG1IP TMD. (B) Conditioned medium (CM) and lysates (L) of HEK293 cells transfected with FN14 constructs carrying the indicated half-transmembrane domains (TMD) were loaded next to each other. The generation of an Aβ-like cleavage product (soluble FN14 or mutants thereof) is indicated by a black arrowhead and was detected upon blotting with anti-HA antibody. Representative blots from N = 3 experiments are presented. For FN14, which served as the reference, N = 12 were tested. (C) The amino acid sequence of each transmembrane domain is provided alongside the logarithmic cleavage efficiency of the respective construct. The boxes highlight the four most C-terminal amino acids of the transmembrane domain, as annotated by Uniprot, where the initial cleavage by γsecretase typically occurs.

(A) Schematic overview of a construct carrying a C-terminal cysteine in the TMD, which is palmitoylated. This posttranslational modification may interfere with normal cleavage of the TMD by γsecretase. The covalent attachment of the palmitic acid to cysteines can be prevented with the general protein palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP). The right part of the panel gives an overview of the TMD sequences of the indicated constructs carrying the wild-type or mutated (red) TMD sequence.

The detection of an Aβ-like cleavage product (indicated by a black arrowhead, soluble FN14 or mutants thereof) is evident in the CM of HEK293 cells transfected with the TMD constructs as validated through blotting with the anti-HA antibody. Cells were treated either with DMSO as a control or the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP. Representative blots from N = 3 experiments are presented.

(A) The schematic overview shows the construct design, where the FN14 construct endogenously carries two cysteines that were exchanged for alanines. Transmembrane domains (TMDs) of FXYD3 and PTTG1IP either carrying the two cysteines within their transmembrane domain or not (see Figure 5A) were swapped into the modified FN14 backbone. (B) Conditioned medium (CM) and lysates (L) of HEK293 cells transfected with FN14 constructs carrying the indicated transmembrane domains (TMD) were loaded next to each other. The detection of an Aβ-like cleavage product (indicated by a black arrowhead) is evident in the CM of HEK293 cells transfected with TMD constructs as validated through blotting with the anti-HA antibody. Cells were treated either with DMSO as a control or DAPT to validate the γsecretase-dependent cleavage. Representative blots from N = 2 experiments are presented. (C) Detection of PEGylation (inferring palmitoylation) of FN14 constructs (upper panel, HA antibody) and endogenous calnexin (lower panel). Treatment with hydroxylamine (NH 2 OH) removes palmitate. Subsequent addition of a 10 kDa mass label (PEG) to the free cysteine increased the molecular weight, as indicated by a blue arrowhead. In this experimental set-up, nonpalmitoylated constructs ran as several bands for unknown reasons. The lower calnexin blot serves as a quality control for the PEG-labeling approach, confirming the NH 2 OH-dependent PEG-labeling of both cysteines in the TMD of calnexin, as denoted by two blue arrowheads.
