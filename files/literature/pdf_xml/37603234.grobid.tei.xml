<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Despite its prevalence and the severity of symptoms, little is known about the pathogenesis and etiology of adenomyosis. In our previous study, Scribble localization has been found to be partially translocated to cytoplasm; however, its regulatory mechanism is known. In consideration of the important role of supraphysiologic estrogen production in the endometrium in the development of adenomyosis, we analyzed the effect and mechanism of estrogen on Scribble localization in vivo and in vitro. Firstly, we found Scribble translocation from the basolateral membrane to the cytoplasm was easily to be seen in women and mice with adenomyosis (68% vs 27%, 60% vs 10% separately). After treatment with the S-palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate for 48H, cytoplasmic enrichment of Scribble and the reduced level of palm-Scribble was observed by immunofluorescence, Western blot, and acyl-biotin exchange palmitoylation assay. High estrogen exposure could not only induce partially cytoplasmic translocation of Scribble but also decrease the expression level of palm-Scribble, which can be recovered by estrogen receptor inhibitor ICI182,780. Based on following experiments, we found that estrogen regulated Scribble localization by APT through S-palmitoylation of Scribble protein. At last, IHC was performed to verify the expression of APT1 and APT2 in human clinical tissue specimens and found that they were all increased dramatically. Furthermore, positive correlations were found between APT1 or APT2 and aromatase P450. Therefore, our research may provide a new understanding of the pathogenesis of adenomyosis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Adenomyosis (ADE) is a common estrogen-dependent benign gynecological disease, which is characterized by the presence of ectopic endometrial tissue (endometrial glands and/or stroma) in the myometrium surrounded by hyperplastic and hypertrophic smooth muscle <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. It is reported that ADE has detrimental effects on 20 to 35% of reproductiveaged women quality of life and consumes substantial healthcare resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Due to the nonspecific symptoms and the lack of a specific and effective test method, its incidence is actually much higher than what is known at present and has a younger and rising trend in recent years.</p><p>Due to the unknown mechanisms, no drug is currently labeled for adenomyosis and there are no specific guidelines to follow for the best management <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Hysterectomy is currently considered the most effective treatment for adenomyosis; however, it is only applicable to older, nearly menopausal women with no fertility requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; drug treatment using suppressive hormone aiming for the hypothalamicpituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis could induce regression of adenomyosis and improve the symptoms, but symptom recurrence after drug discontinuation, obvious side effects and pregnancy limitation becomes the principal drawbacks of these medical options <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Supraphysiologic estrogen production in the endometrium is widely considered to be closely related to the occurrence of adenomyosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In adenomyosis, abnormal production of local estrogen is thought to be the result of increased <ref type="bibr">1 3</ref> aromatase activity and decreased estrogen metabolism in the endometrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Researchers have found that estrogen can not only contribute to hyperplasia and epithelial mesenchymal transformation of endometrial glandular epithelium but also promote oxytocin-mediated uterine contractions, which could cause hyperperistalsis and tissue microtrauma in the junction zone and eventual activation of the tissue injury and repair (TIAR) mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Our previous research has found that estrogen can disrupt the polarity of endometrial glandular epithelial cells through E3 ubiquitin ligase HECW1-mediated Scribble degradation. Also, Scribble was observed to be mislocated to cytoplasm in adenomyosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The polarity protein Scribble, a member of the LAP family proteins, contains <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> LRRs at the N terminus, followed by two LAP-specific domains (LAPSD) and 4 PDZ domains, which is located at the basolateral membrane in endometrial epithelial cells of healthy women <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. It plays an important role in establishing and maintaining apical-basal polarity, controlling tissue growth, differentiation, and cell-directed migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In breast cancer and liver cancer, genetically normal Scribble mislocated from cell-cell junctions to the cytoplasm, correlating with enhanced growth signaling and malignancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. In addition, Scribble intracellular localization changes can also cooperate with oncogenes (Ras or Myc) to promote tumorigenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Despite the critical role for Scribble membrane localization, little is known about the role and molecular mechanism of Scribble re-localization in the development of adenomyosis.</p><p>Protein S-palmitoylation is a post-translational lipidation with a reversible thioester bond between a cysteine residue and 16-carbon fatty acid, palmitate, which is important in regulating trafficking and localization of many peripheral and integral membrane proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. S-Palmitoylation is dynamically regulated by two opposite types of enzymes, protein S-acyl transferases (PATs), and acyl protein thioesterases (APTs). PATs mainly refer to zDHHC enzymes due to their predicted Zn 2+ -binding and conserved Asp-His-HisCys motif and work in catalyzing protein S-palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. 23 zDHHC genes have been identified in human genome databases. De-palmitoylation is catalyzed by one or more HDFP-sensitive hydrolases, mainly referring to APT1 and APT2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. PATs or APTs small molecule inhibitors such as 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), palmostatin B can be used in the treatment of diseases by regulating the level of S-palmitoylation modification of proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Scribble has been identified as palmitoylated by zDHHC7 in MCF10A human epithelial cells and APT2 inhibition restores Scribble localization and S-palmitoylation in Snail-transformed breast epithelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, suggesting that Scribble participates in an active S-palmitoylation cycle similar to that of palmitoylated Ras, where zDHHCs add and APTs remove S-palmitoyl groups from Scribble.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesize that estrogen promotes cytoplasmic translocation though downregulating Scribble S-palmitoylation in the development of adenomyosis and promoting Scribble localization restoration by regulating its S-palmitoylation may be a newly and effectively method for adenomyosis treatment.</p></div>

All tissue samples were obtained after written, full, and informed consent from recruited subjects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Patients and Human Tissue Collection</head><p>After informed written consent, totally 19 human endometrial samples from adenomyosis patients were collected at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (Suzhou, China), from June 2021 to June 2022. Their diagnoses were made by transvaginal ultrasound before surgery and histologically confirmed post-operatively. For controls, endometrial tissue samples were collected from 15 women who had undergone hysterectomy because of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-III, cervical carcinoma in situ, or stage IA1 cervical cancer but free of endometriosis, adenomyosis, and uterine fibroids. All the recruited women in both study and control groups had regular cycles and had not received any hormonal or antiplatelet treatment for at least 3 months prior to tissue collection. Two wedges of tissue from the lumen to the muscular myometrial layer that included superficial and basal endometrium as well as myometrium was taken from the detached uterus, then immediately fixed in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature for 48H and embedded in paraffin for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or immunohistochemical staining.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Mislocalization of polarity protein Scribble in eutopic endometrium of adenomyosis patients and tamoxifeninduced adenomyosis mice.</head><p>The characteristics of the recruited patients with adenomyosis and the control subjects listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. As shown in the table, the patients in different groups were comparable in age, live births, miscarriages, and cycle length. However, patients with adenomyosis had significantly bigger uterine sizes, heavier menses, and more severe dysmenorrhea.</p><p>Using IHC, the subcellular Scribble localization in endometrial biopsies of control and adenomyosis patients were investigated. As shown in the Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>, although Scribble was localized at the plasma membrane in eutopic endometrium of women without adenomyosis in 73% of all cases (11/15), partially translocation to cytoplasm of Scribble was detectable in 68% of adenomyosis cases <ref type="bibr">(13/19)</ref>.</p><p>In order to find out whether the subcellular Scribble localization in mouse has the similar change to that found in the human endometrium. Tamoxifen was used to induce adenomyosis in newborn ICR mice. The complete absence of any ectopic endometrium in the myometrium is considered as successful establishment of adenomyosis mouse model. At day 42, all mice in the tamoxifen-induced group showed endometrial invasion into the myometrium, while no ectopic endometrium was observed in the myometrium of the control group. Compared with mice in the control group (9/10), mislocalization of Scribble was observed in 60% of adenomyosis cases (6/10) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">S-Palmitoylation of Scribble regulates its membrane localization in endometrial epithelial cells</head><p>Since Scribble requires S-palmitoylation for membrane recruitment in MDCK, we explored if defects in Scribble S-palmitoylation might provide a potential mechanism for mislocalization in endometrial epithelial cells. C The acyl-biotin exchange assay of protein extracts isolated from control and 10 -6 M estrogen-treated cells (palmitoylation assay). Cells not treated with hydroxylamine (HA) served as negative controls and the molecular weight of relevant marker for each band was labelled. D Quantitative analysis of membranous Scribble, cytoplasmic Scribble and the expression level of palm-Scribble after estrogen treatment. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test was used for statistical analyses. Symbols for statistical significance levels: *P &lt; 0.05 and **P &lt; 0.01 respectively After treating Ishikawa cells with different concentrations (25 μM, 50 μM, or 75 μM) of the general palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP for 48H, the expression of membranous and cytoplasmic Scribble was detected by immunofluorescence and cytoplasmic enrichment has been seen following different concentrations of 2-BP (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). we separated the membranous and cytoplasmic protein by Mem-PER TM Plus kit and found membranous Scribble was decreased significantly and cytoplasmic Scribble was increased significantly after 25 μM 2-BP treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure">D</ref>), compared with the control group. Meanwhile, the reduced level of palm-Scribble caused by 25 μM 2-BP was further verified by western blot (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C-D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Estrogen regulates Scribble localization and S-palmitoylation in endometrial epithelial cells.</head><p>Supraphysiologic estrogen production in the endometrium is considered to be the culprit of adenomyosis. Therefore, we treated Ishikawa cells with 10 -6 M estrogen or/and estrogen receptor inhibitor ICI182,780 for 48H and the result demonstrated that estrogen contributed to Scribble mislocalization which can be recovered by estrogen receptor inhibitor ICI182,780 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A</ref>). A significantly decrease in membranous Scribble and a significantly increase in cytoplasmic Scribble was further verified by Western blot (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3B</ref> &amp;<ref type="figure">D</ref>). Moreover, the expression level of palm-Scribble was dramatically decreased with estrogen treatment compared with the control group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3C-D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Screening and verification of PATs or APTs induced by estrogen</head><p>We hypothesized that estrogen may perturb the Scribble S-palmitoylation cycle equilibrium by disrupting normal PATs or APTs expression. To explore this question, total RNA was isolated from control and estrogen-treated cells for RT-PCR of all 23 zDHHCs. Surprisingly, estrogen treatment did not affect the mRNA level of any zDHHCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>).</p><p>Both APT1 and APT2 are annotated as protein de-palmitoylases and are widely expressed and active across nearly all tissues. Then, we detected the effect of 10 -6 M estrogen on the protein level of APT1, APT2, and zDHHC7 which has been reported to have a regulatory effect on Scribble palmitoylation in MDCK and found the expression levels of both APT1 and APT2 were increased significantly, while the M estrogen treatment. β-Tubulin served as loading controls and the molecular weight of relevant marker for each band was labelled. Twotailed unpaired Student's t-test was used for statistical analyses.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">APT inhibition rescues Scribble plasma membrane localization and S-palmitoylation induced by estrogen.</head><p>We next explored if inhibiting de-palmitoylation might restore Scribble membrane localization and its S-palmitoylation cycle balance. Ishikawa cells were treated with 10 -6 M estrogen or/and the APT inhibitor palmostatin B (25 μM) for 48H. The result demonstrated that when palmostatin B was added in, estrogen did not have a significant effect on Scribble plasma membrane localization and its S-palmitoylation any more (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>), which suggested the important role of APTs in estrogen-induced Scribble cytoplasmic translocation and reduction of Scribble S-palmitoylation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Expression of APT1 and APT2 was verified in human</head><p>specimens of adenomyosis patients.</p><p>Finally, we verified the expression of APT1 and APT2 in adenomyosis patients and their correlation with estrogen production. We revealed that APT1 and APT2 staining was mainly seen in endometrial epithelial cells and mostly localized in the cytoplasm and cytomembrane, while aromatase P450, a key enzyme for estrogen synthesis was seen both in epithelial and stromal cells and was mostly localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6A</ref>).</p><p>Compared with control endometrium, the expression of aromatase P450, APT1, and APT2 in the eutopic endometrium of patients with adenomyosis was all increased significantly (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6B</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>ADE is an often-overlooked heterogeneous gynecologic condition that causes infertility, pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and dysmenorrhea. It is generally recognized that supraphysiologic estrogen production in the eutopic endometrium plays an important role in the pathophysiology of adenomyosis; however, little is known about its effects on the direction of gland epithelial cell growth that is related to cell polarity. In our previous research, the subcellular localization of Scribble has been found to be partially translocated to cytoplasm, suggesting its possible involvement in the development of adenomyosis.</p><p>In this study, we first verified the subcellular localization of Scribble in adenomyosis patients and tamoxifen-induced adenomyosis mice. Scribble translocation from the basolateral membrane to the cytoplasm was easily to be seen in women with adenomyosis (68% vs 27%). At day 42, all the mice in the tamoxifen-treated group successfully formed lesions of adenomyosis and the similar change of Scribble localization was also found in adenomyosis model mice (60% vs 10%).</p><p>As an important part of the Scribble polarity complex, Scribble contributes to multiple physiological processes.</p><p>In epithelial tumors, Scribble is often considered a tumor suppressor. Downregulation of Scribble was observed in endometrial cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, non-small cell lung cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and prostate cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> which was closely related to positive lymph node metastasis, chemotherapy resistance, and poor prognosis. Knockdown of Scribble has been verified to accelerate the migration and invasion of tumor cells in vitro. Furthermore, Scribble localization is also necessary for polarized cells. Scribble localizes to the basolateral membrane, yet is mislocalized to the cytosol in most epithelial cancers, correlating with disrupted cell polarity, enhanced growth signaling, and transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. Despite the critical role for Scribble membrane localization, little is known about how Scribble re-localizes to the cytosol in adenomyosis.</p><p>Since it is reported that Scribble requires S-palmitoylation for membrane recruitment, we then explored if defects in Scribble S-palmitoylation might provide a potential mechanism for mislocalization in adenomyosis. Further in vitro investigation was conducted in Ishikawa cell lines and found Scribble re-localizes from the membrane to the cytosol along with decreased expression of palm-Scribble after treating with 2-bromopalmitate, the general palmitoylation inhibitor by inhibiting the function of PATs, indicating that the S-palmitoylation cycle may be also involved in the translocation process of Scribble in adenomyosis.</p><p>In view of the importance of estrogen in the pathogenesis of adenomyosis, we tried to illustrate the effect of estrogen on the subcellular localization and S-palmitoylation of Scribble in endometrial epithelial cells. Our study found that high concentration of estrogen could not only reduce the expression of palm-Scribble in glandular epithelial cells but also changed its intracellular localization which was consistent with what we found in mice and patients with adenomyosis, suggesting that estrogen functionally targets the S-palmitoylation machinery, which cooperates in disrupting cell polarity and the displacement of Scribble from the plasma membrane.</p><p>In order to screen the PAT that may contribute to the perturbation of Scribble S-palmitoylation cycle equilibrium induced by estrogen, total RNA was isolated from control and estrogen-treated cells for RT-PCR of all 23 zDHHC PATs. Surprisingly, all zDHHC mRNAs had no significantly change after high concentration of estrogen exposure. Although zDHHC7 was recently reported to participate in Scribble plasma membrane localization, we found neither mRNA levels nor protein levels of zDHHC7 were changed significantly followed estrogen treatment, suggesting estrogen either attenuates zDHHC7 activity or bypasses zDHHC7-dependent Scribble S-palmitoylation. APT1 and APT2 are annotated as protein de-palmitoylases and are targets of several classes of covalent serine hydrolase inhibitors, including β-lactones <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, triazole ureas <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and N-hydroxyhydantoin carbamates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In the following experiment, estrogen has been found to lead to a 1.5-fold increase of APT1 and a 2-fold or greater increase of APT2 at their protein levels, potentially shifting the balance of the S-palmitoylation cycle.</p><p>Given the observed dynamic S-palmitoylation of Scribble in endometrial epithelial cells, we hypothesized that de-palmitoylase inhibition might enhance Scribble S-palmitoylation levels and restore plasma membrane localization in estrogen-treated cells. The β-lactone inhibitor palmostatin B is the most widely used APT inhibitor and is primarily selective for both APT1 and APT2 at low micromolar concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Treatment with palmostatin B reportedly blocks the Ras S-palmitoylation cycle, restoring epitheliallike features to HRasG12V-transformed MDCK cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Research highlighted a central role for MC1R palmitoylation in protecting against melanoma found inhibition of depalmitoylation by palmostatin B might be a potential clinical prevention strategy for melanoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In our study, palmostatin B treatment promoted Scribble membrane re-localization and increased Scribble S-palmitoylation levels in estrogen-treated cells, without having significant effects on Scribble localization in control cells, limiting the response to the estrogen-induced cells. Overall, we found that Scribble is regulated by an APT-dependent S-palmitoylation cycle, which is necessary for efficient membrane localization.</p><p>Finally, we verified the expression of APT1, APT2, and aromatase P450 in human specimens and found that they all increased significantly in eutopic endometrium of humans with adenomyosis. Furthermore, positive correlations between APT1 or APT2 and aromatase P450 have been found using Pearson's correlation test.</p><p>Our study has two limitations. First, all ADE patients enrolled in our study were diffuse type, whether our conclusion can be extended to focal ADE remains to be demonstrated. Second, although reestablishment of cellular polarity is to our knowledge not possible, specific downstream effector mechanisms may represent promising therapeutic target structures for a subgroup of patients with distinct alterations of cell polarity factors. Therefore, future researches may be focused on biologic behavior and downstream effector mechanisms via mutated Scribble with enforced cytoplasmic enrichment.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that estrogen-induced Scribble mislocalization in endometrial epithelial cells through APTmediated S-palmitoylation might be one of the key mechanisms in the development of adenomyosis, which may provide a new understanding of the pathogenesis of adenomyosis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 Fig. 2 C</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Mislocalization of Scribble in adenomyosis patients and tamoxifen-induced adenomyosis mice.
