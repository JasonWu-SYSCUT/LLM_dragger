			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Palmitoylation plays an important role in modulating protein trafficking, stability, and activity. The major predicament in protein palmitoylation study is the lack of specific and sensitive tools to visualize protein-specific palmitoylation. Although FRET approach was explored by metabolically labeled palmitic acid and antibody recognized target protein. The trans-membrane strategy suffers from low FRET efficiency due to the donor and acceptor located at different sides of membrane. Herein, we proposed a cis-membrane multi-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (multi-FRET) for amplified visualization of specific palmitoylated proteins through metabolic labeling and targeted recognition. The azido-palmitic acid (azido-PA) was metabolically incorporated into cellular palmitoylated proteins, followed by reacting with dibenzylcylooctyne-modified Cy5 (DBCO-Cy5) through copper-free click chemistry. The protein probe was attached to targeted protein by specific peptide recognition, which initiates a hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification process. The cis-membrane labeling method enables effective intramolecular donor-acceptor distance and allow to increase FRET efficiency. Simultaneously, HCR amplification triggered multi-FRET phenomenon with significantly improved FRET efficiency. With the superiority, this strategy has achieved the enhanced FRET imaging of palmitoylated PD-L1 and visualizing the palmitoylation changes of on PD-L1 under drug treatment. Furthermore, the established method successfully amplified visualization of PD-L1 palmitoylation in vivo and mice tumor slice. We envision the approach would provide a useful platform to investigate the effects of palmitoylation on the protein structure and function.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Post-translational modifications of proteins greatly influence the structure and functions of proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Typically, palmitoylation plays an important role in regulating protein bioactivities, intracellular and intercellular trafficking, as well as stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Studying the palmitoylated state of proteins and their intracellular dynamics are of great significance in the verification of complex signaling pathways and adjustment of space and time. Yet investigation of cellular protein functions and trafficking through palmitoylation remain a significant challenge partially owing to a lack of tools.</p><p>Over the past few years, several biochemical methods have been developed for protein-specific palmitoylation analysis. For example, Hannoush et al. proposed a strategy for imaging the Wnt palmitoylation based on bioorthogonal probes and proximity ligation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Similarly, Hannoush et al. reported a click-chemistry-based palmitate probes combined with proximity ligation on antibodies to the click-conjugated dye for visualizing palmitoylated cellular proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. The metabolic palmitic acid labeling technique is a powerful tool for protein-specific palmitoylation visualization. Recently, a trans-membrane forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) strategy was investigated to image cell surface receptor palmitoylation through metabolic labeling and targeted labeling from a FRET donor-acceptor pair <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. As a talented tool, FRET has been widely applied to intermolecular interactions analysis and protein structure exploration.</p><p>However, there are still several setbacks that need to be addressed for FRET application. First, the FRET efficiency depends on the donoracceptor separation distance with a range of 1-10 nm <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Given the membrane itself possessing a thickness of about 4 nm, trans-membrane FRET significantly compromises the FRET efficiency for a cell surface receptor when the donor and acceptor located at different sides of membrane. Besides, the rigid spherical structure and big size of antibodies may not be favorable for FRET on account of dispersive fluorophore. Also, the antibody recognition site and palmitoylation site are usually distributed in different sides of membrane for a cell surface receptor, which greatly hinders the measurement via FRET.</p><p>To facilitate the occurrence of FRET phenomenon, labeling of target protein with small size and flexible ligands provides an effective alternative. Besides, the cis-membrane FRET is necessary for ensuring the effectiveness of FRET. Toward this goal, we herein proposed a hybridization chain reaction (HCR)-based cis-membrane multi-FRET for amplified visualization of PD-L1 palmitoylation in situ. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the azido-palmitic acid (azido-PA) was metabolic incorporated into cellular palmitoylated proteins, followed by reaction with dibenzylcylooctyne-modified Cy5 (DBCO-Cy5) through copper-free click chemistry. For PD-L1 targeted labeling, we employed a reported peptide from huntingtin interacting protein 1 that possesses strong binding ability with PD-L1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>. Also, the binding site of PD-L1 binging peptide (PBP) and PD-L1 is located at cytosolic domain of PD-L1, which is in the same side as PD-L1 palmitoylation site. Therefore, targeted labeling PD-L1 with PBP allows the cis-membrane FRET. To further enhance the efficiency of FRET, we designed a short DNA strand (H0) conjugated with PBP (P-H0), which could act as an initiator strand to trigger a non-enzyme HCR amplification process under room temperature. The amplified labeling of PD-L1 targeted protein produced more fluorophore to trigger multi-FRET signal, which effectively improved the sensitivity for imaging of palmitoylated PD-L1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Investigation of HCR and probe recognition</head><p>The azido-PA was incorporated into cultured cells and ligated to palmitoylated proteins by metabolic labeling. We firstly investigated the cytotoxicity of azido-PA in response to the treatment concentration. As showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>, no obvious viability changes were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells after co-incubation with azido-PA. Meanwhile, the formation of the HCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. In the presence of H0, H1 and H2, long smeared DNA polymers appeared, indicative of the initiation of HCR reaction (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>).</p><p>The binding performance of targeted labeling probe (PBP) and metabolic labeling probe (DBCO-Cy5) are essential for FRET imaging palmitoylated PD-L1. Therefore, we verified the click chemistry reaction of azido-PA and DBCO-Cy5 as well as binding ability of PBP and PD-L1 by flow cytometry. As displayed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>, clear PBP fluorescence signals were observed in comparison with the control and random peptide. Meanwhile, there were strong Cy5 fluorescence signals after cells incubation with azido-PA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>). These results suggest that the PBP and DBCO-Cy5 both could attach onto the MDA-MB-231 cells by different approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation by cis-membrane multi-FRET</head><p>As a proof of concept, we investigated the feasibility of visualization palmitoylated PD-L1 by cis-membrane multi-FRET. Cy3 and Cy5 are a FRET donor-acceptor pair, proved by the suitable overlap of Cy3 emission spectrum and Cy5 excitation spectrum (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>). As showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>, bright FRET-induced Cy5 fluorescence was only observed after addition of P-H0 and azido-PA. In the case of specific labeling of PD-L1 or only palmitoylated protein, no measurable FRET signals was recorded. The FRET signals were also verified by flow cytometric. As showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>, C and 2D, the P-H0 triggered HCR (P-H0-HCR) fluorescence </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Verification of intramolecular FRET</head><p>Although FRET signals were detected through HCR amplification and metabolic labeling, it remains questionable whether the signals came from intramolecular FRET on the same protein as the signals may have been derived from the adjacent protein palmitoylation (intermolecular FRET). The intramolecular and intermolecular FRET for PD-L1 palmitoylation is schematically illustrated in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>. Given these effects, we hypothesized that FRET signals from intramolecular FRET will disappearance if the palmitoylation of PD-L1 was abolished. Emerging studies reported that Cys272 might be the sole palmitoylation site of PD-L1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. On this basis, substitution of the Cys272 residue by alanine (C272A) through mutagenesis completely abolished the palmitoylation of PD-L1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S2</ref>). Consequently, breast cancer cell BT-474 (PD-L1 negative) was respectively transfected with PD-L1 wild type (WT) plasmid and C272A mutation plasmid. As showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S3</ref>, the To further prove the observed signals from intramolecular FRET in a more convincing manner, we carried out acceptor photobleaching experiments to confirm the enhanced emission fluorescence of Cy3 after bleaching of the acceptor (Cy5) fluorescence. To this end, a portion of the cells was exposed to 638 nm laser to bleach the fluorescence of Cy5. Besides, the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence were independently recorded in previous bleaching and post bleaching. For C272A group, the mean value of Cy3 fluorescence intensity were essentially unaltered after bleaching of the Cy5 fluorescence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). In contrast, the mean value of Cy3 fluorescence intensity were significantly increased as a consequence of Cy5 photobleaching in WT group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). These results further indicated that the detected FRET signals were mostly derived from intramolecular FRET.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Enhanced effect of the HCR-based multi-FRET</head><p>In general, the number of palmitoylation site is higher than the total number of the binding ligand for a particular palmitoylated protein, which would affect FRET efficiency. In view of this, we further propose a HCR-based multi-FRET method to improve FRET efficiency in imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation. In Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>, we compared the fluorescence intensity of single FRET and multi-FRET. The FRET signal with HCR amplification was much higher than that of the HCR free control. Furthermore, we observed the enhanced fluorescence intensity of Cy3 after bleaching of the Cy5 fluorescence. As is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>, the enhanced fluorescence intensity of Cy3 was weak after bleaching of the Cy5 fluorescence in the absence of HCR amplification. Conversely, the Cy3 fluorescence intensity were significantly increased after bleaching of the Cy5 fluorescence in the presence of HCR amplification (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). Those observation supported that Cy3 donors located on PD-L1 could contribute more to the FRET signals in the existence of HCR amplification.</p><p>In addition, we calculated the FRET efficiency with HCR or without HCR. FRET efficiency was calculated from the formula FRET efficiency = {(Cy3 post-bleaching -Cy3 pre-bleaching )/Cy3 post-bleaching } × 100. As is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4F</ref>, the FRET efficiency with HCR was nearly 4 times higher than that without HCR, suggestive of the enhanced FRET efficiency via the HCR-based multi-FRET strategy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">Visualization PD-L1 palmitoylation in different breast cancer cells</head><p>To further investigate the general applicability of as-proposed cismembrane multi-FRET method, we next employed the strategy to image PD-L1 palmitoylation in different breast cells. Previous studies reported the PD-L1 expression level in different breast cancer cells (MCF-7 cells with low expression of PD-L1; SK-BR-3 with moderate expression of PD-L1; BT-549 cells with high expression of PD-L1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Here, we selected the three breast cancer cells with different expression levels of PD-L1 and assessed PD-L1 expression by Western blot analysis, which were consistent with previous report (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>Next, palmitoylated PD-L1 was visualized through confocal microscopy imaging based cis-membrane multi-FRET strategy. As showed in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>, weak FRET fluorescence signal was observed from MCF-7 cells, moderate FRET fluorescence signal was observed from SK-BR-3 cells, while BT-549 cells displayed bright FRET fluorescence signal. These results demonstrate that the proposed cis-membrane multi-FRET strategy is generally applicable and able to accurately recognize PD-L1 palmitoylation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Analysis of PD-L1 palmitoylation under drug treatment</head><p>Also, we evaluated the ability of the cis-membrane multi-FRET method invisualization the palmitoylation changes of target proteins under drug treatment. ML348, a selective inhibitors of acyl protein thioesterase 1, may increase the palmitoylation level of proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Next, we treated MCF-7 cells with different concentrations of ML348. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>, the FRET fluorescence intensity gradually enhanced along with the increased ML348 concentration, suggesting the PD-L1 palmitoylation level improvement. Interestingly, the Cy3 fluorescence intensity from PD-L1 also significantly increased through ML348 treatment in MCF-7 cells. Previous studies revealed palmitoylation of PD-L1 suppressed PD-L1 degradation by the lysosomal pathway and improve PD-L1 stability. Consistently, we noticed the level of PD-L1 elevated with ML348 treatment by Western blot analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>).</p><p>Likewise, we inhibited protein palmitoylation level with a protein palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP. As expected, treatment by 2-BP obviously decreased the FERT fluorescence intensity in BT-549 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). Similarly, the level of PD-L1 declined due to depalmitoylation promoting PD-L1 degradation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). These results suggests that the cis-membrane multi-FRET method would serve as a potential drug screening method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Imaging of PD-L1 palmitoylation in vivo</head><p>Further, we explored the ability of established cis-membrane multi-FRET method to visualize PD-L1 palmitoylation in vivo. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7A</ref>, azido-PA group displayed a significantly fluorescence signal in the tumor area in comparation with control group. Similarly, obvious FERT fluorescence signals were observed in azido-PA treatment mice tumor slice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7B</ref>). In contrast, barely any FRET fluorescence signal was generated for non-treated mice tumor slice. Moreover, different treatment group mice tumors were extracted and digested into single cell suspension to analyze PD-L1 palmitoylation by flow cytometric. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7C, D</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7E</ref>, the FERT fluorescence signals could only be observed in azido-PA treated mice tumor cells, indicating the cis-membrane multi-FRET strategy effective recognition of palmitoylated PD-L1 in tumor sample.</p><p>In addition, H&amp;E staining showed no pathological changes were observed in different organs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7F</ref>), indicating that azido-PA is a safe and effective metabolic labeling strategy.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In conclusion, we proposed a cis-membrane multi-FRET for amplified visualization of specific palmitoylated proteins through metabolic labeling and targeted recognition. The cis-membrane labeling method enables effective intramolecular donor-acceptor distance and allow to increase FRET efficiency. Simultaneously, HCR amplification triggered multi-FRET phenomenon with significantly improved FRET efficiency. The strategy has achieved the enhanced FRET imaging of palmitoylated PD-L1 and visualizing the palmitoylation changes of PD-L1 under drug treatment. Furthermore, as-established method successfully amplified visualization of PD-L1 palmitoylation in vivo and mice tumor slice. We envision our strategy would provide a useful alternative for the imaging of other palmitoylated protein or other types of post-translational modification.</p></div>
