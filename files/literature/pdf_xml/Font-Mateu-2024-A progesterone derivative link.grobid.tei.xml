<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In hormone-responsive breast cancer cells, progesterone (P4) has been shown to act via its nuclear receptor (nPR), a ligandactivated transcription factor. A small fraction of progesterone receptor is palmitoylated and anchored to the cell membrane (mbPR) forming a complex with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). Upon hormone exposure, either directly or via interaction with ERα, mbPR activates the SRC/RAS/ERK kinase pathway leading to phosphorylation of nPR by ERK. Kinase activation is essential for P4 gene regulation, as the ERK and MSK1 kinases are recruited by the nPR to its genomic binding sites and trigger chromatin remodeling. An interesting open question is whether activation of mbPR can result in gene regulation in the absence of ligand binding to intracellular progesterone receptor (iPR). This matter has been investigated in the past using P4 attached to serum albumin, but the attachment is leaky and albumin can be endocytosed and degraded, liberating P4. Here, we propose a more stringent approach to address this issue by ensuring attachment of P4 to the cell membrane via covalent binding to a stable phospholipid. This strategy identifies the actions of P4 independent from hormone binding to iPR. We found that a membrane-attached progestin can activate mbPR, the ERK signaling pathway leading to iPR phosphorylation, initial gene regulation and entry into the cell cycle, in the absence of detectable intracellular progestin.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The dominant view of steroid hormone action is that these amphipathic molecules diffuse through the cell membrane and interact with their intracellular receptors, members of the large nuclear receptor family, which shuttle between the In Memoriam Dr. Antonio Delgado. cytoplasm and cell nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In response to binding their specific hormone ligand, the intracellular receptors dissociate from chaperones, dimerize and concentrate in the cell nucleus, where they interact with DNA sequences called hormone response elements (HRE), or with other transcription factors, and regulate the rate of transcription of their target genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Progesterone (P4) is a steroid hormone that regulates target cell behavior in many tissues via interaction with the intracellular progesterone receptor (iPR). In breast cancer cells, we have described the interaction of ligandactivated iPR with progesterone responsive elements (PREs) in chromatin and the subsequent chromatin remodeling steps required for gene regulation (for a recent review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beato et al. 2020)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, in addition to these well-established genomic pathways, steroid hormones are known to act via a non-genomic mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In breast cancer cells, estradiol activates the SRC/RAS/ERK kinase pathway via a small fraction of the nuclear estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) attached to the cell membrane (mbERα) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. We found that in T47D breast cancer cells this kinase pathway is also activated by progestins, via a small fraction of progesterone receptor (PR) attached to the cell membrane (mbPR) in a complex with mbERα <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Upon P4 exposure, the SRC/RAS/ ERK kinase pathway is activated <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. It is also known that PR membrane attachment is mediated by the palmitoylation of cysteine 820, located in a short amino acid region of the ligand binding domain conserved in other steroid hormone receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. After exposure to 10 nM progestin, the mbPR remains attached to the cell membrane, while the activated ERK kinase phosphorylates iPR at serine 294, leading to its activation, displacement of its associated chaperones and dimerization. This activated phosphoPR (pPR) forms a ternary complex with activated ERK and MSK1 that binds to PREs in the nucleus and initiates the changes in chromatin and transcription factor recruitment that lead to the regulation of P4-responsive genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. In recent studies we found that progestins are able to activate the response of breast cancer cells at 50 pM concentration, 200-fold lower than used in most previous studies, by activating the kinase signaling pathway and promoting pPR binding to a small subset of accessible enhancers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>An interesting question is whether hormone entry into the cells and binding to the iPR is necessary for activating cell response to P4. It is in principle possible that hormone binding to the mbPR and subsequent kinase activation is sufficient to promote phosphorylation of the ligand-free PR, followed by dissociation of pPR from the chaperones, dimerization, binding to accessible chromatin PREs, and activation of the cell response. In the past, several groups have used steroid hormones attached to serum albumin in an attempt to demonstrate that the hormones can act without crossing the cell membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. However, this strategy is not convincing for two main reasons: the attachment of steroids to albumin is non-covalent, and albumin can be endocytosed and degraded by lysosomes leading to release of P4 into the cytosol. Here we report an original and more stringent approach to ensure that the hormone remains firmly attached to the cell membrane during the experimental procedure, allowing the study of those hormonal functions, if any, that only require ligand binding to the mbPR. To this end, we attached a P4 derivative via a linker chain to the polar head group of a phosphatidylcholine analogue, an Archaea-like phospholipid with two fatty acids linked to glycerol by ether bonds that cannot be cleaved by cellular phospholipases A2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Therefore, the steroid would be stably anchored to the membrane via the alkyl phospholipid, and the linker chain (4-8 ethylene oxide units) would provide space for the anchored steroid to reach the mbPR binding site <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In addition, the lipid was fluorescently labeled in one of the alkyl chains to allow detection within the cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The results show that our approach works in principle, as the membrane-attached P4 derivative activates the cell response to hormone, without entering the cell. This strategy may help in the study of the proteins associated with membranebound hormone receptors and their interactions with protein kinases. In addition, this study underscores the physiological importance of low levels of hormone receptors attached to the cell membrane in breast cancer, which opens the possibility to target them for blocking kinase activation as part of the endocrine therapy of cancer.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and synthesis of the probes</head><p>The probes used in this work (CRG033, CRG047, CRG034 and CRG048) consist of a progesterone derivative attached to the polar head group of a chemically modified lipid by means of a polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker of variable length (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>For a full account of the synthetic experimental part see the Supporting Information. Briefly, a Cu(I)-catalyzed azidealkyne <ref type="bibr">[3 + 2]</ref> dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) between an azide-terminated moiety bearing the progesterone derivative and an alkyne-containing lipid was envisaged as a suitable and efficient way to synthetically ensemble the targeted probes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. To provide a stable anchor to the cell membrane, an ether-linked phosphatidylcholine derivative was used as the lipidic moiety of the probes. As opposed to ester-linked lipids, in this Archaea-like phospholipid structure the two acyl chains were linked to the glycerol by ether bonds, which conferred an increased metabolic stability against cellular phospholipases A2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the lipid was fluorescently labeled in one of the alkyl chains in order to allow probe detection during in vitro and in vivo experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Nile Red was chosen as a fluorophore. Under physiological conditions, Nile Red is an uncharged, low-polar molecule, which facilitates dye insertion into the cell membrane. Hence, a 2-hydroxy Nile-Red derivative was placed at the distal position of one of the lipid alkyl chains via an ether bond (Supplementary Information Scheme S4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>As previously mentioned, a PEG linker was connecting the steroidal and lipid moieties of the probes. Insertion of a short-chain PEG conferred water solubility to the probes and increased their amphipathic nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In this case, we reasoned that linkers with either four (CRG033 and CRG034) or eight (CRG047 and CRG048) ethylene oxide units would provide enough space for the progesterone derivative to reach the mbPR binding site and exert its activity (Supplementary Information Scheme S1).</p><p>Since the C3 ketone functionality is known to be crucial for PR activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the progesterone fragment was attached to the probe at the 17β position of the steroidal scaffold. In compounds CRG033 and CRG047, the steroid was anchored to the linker via an amide bond, which preserved the carbonyl functionality of the natural ligand but could be susceptible of metabolic degradation by amidases. Thus, despite not bearing the C20 carbonyl group of progesterone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), the chemically and metabolically more stable ether-containing probes CRG034 and CRG048 were also prepared (Supplementary Information Schemes S2, S3 and S4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Affinity of the synthesized compounds for PR</head><p>The chemical structure of several of the synthesized compounds and of a possible product of the hydrolysis of the amide bond of CRG033 or CRG047 (labeled CRG049) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. After their chemical and fluorometric characterization (see Supporting Information, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> and Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>), we first explored their affinity for purified recombinant full-length PR expressed in baculovirus <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> using microscale thermophoresis (MST, see Experimental Section for details). Among tested compounds, only CRG047 exhibited a Kd for PR (≈ 14 nM) at the same low nM range as P4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, b and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2a-d</ref>). A comparable affinity was found using the recombinant ligand-binding domain of PR expressed in E. coli <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). We therefore chose CRG047 for subsequent characterization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CRG047 in lipid bilayers</head><p>The fluorescence properties of CRG047 in organic solvent (ethanol) are summarized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>. For measuring the critical micellar concentration (CMC) of CRG047, increasing concentrations of the compound dissolved in DMSO were added to 25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, and the increase in emitted fluorescence was measured to estimate its CMC, that was of ≈ 12 μM (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>).</p><p>To study the CRG047 affinity for phospholipid membranes, increasing amounts of the compound in DMSO were added to a suspension of small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), and the fluorescence was recorded. Fluorescence intensity increased until saturation was reached (at ≈ 20 µM under our conditions) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>). The lower this concentration, the higher is the affinity of the compound for the vesicles. The time increase of bound CRG047 after mixing (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>) indicated that the compound did not leave the membranes for several hours, and that additional compound was gradually transferred from micelles to membrane bilayers (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>). CRG047 contains both hydrophobic (PC-derivative + progesterone derivative) and hydrophilic (PEG linker) moieties, i.e., it is an amphipathic molecule. This leads to the compound existing initially in equilibrium between the lipid and water phases, but finally being transferred to the non-polar lipid phase, for which it appears to have some preference. In contrast with the amphipathic CRG047, the less polar Liss-RhPE reached equilibrium with the bilayers in the first minutes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3d</ref>). The excitation and emission spectra of CRG047 (in SUVs) are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3e</ref>.</p><p>The topology of CRG047 in membranes can be inferred from studies on the partition of amphipathic molecules into membranes (see e.g., review in Lichtenberg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). It can be presumed that both non-polar moieties (PC-derivative + progesterone derivative) will diffuse across the membrane hydrophobic core, and reach, at least in part, the inner monolayer, thus having access to the mbPR. In contrast, the polar PEG linker moiety would remain outside the membrane. It cannot be ruled out, however, that the PEG moiety can also move across the membrane, driven by the motion of the non-polar components; in any case the progesterone moiety would be unable to diffuse through the cytosol, because of the phospholipid anchor.</p><p>We also used fluorescence microscopy to explore the incorporation and retention of CRG047 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>) into the membranes of preformed giant vesicles (GUV). For this purpose GUV were electroformed containing DiO (a hydrophobic probe different from Liss-RhPE), shown in green in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref>. The resulting GUV were oligolamellar, i.e., some of them contained other smaller vesicles inside (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f top)</ref>. When these already formed GUV were treated with externally added CRG047 (in red, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3f</ref> middle), only the larger, outer vesicles were stained, showing that CRG047 cannot diffuse across the membranes. CRG047 remained in the outermost vesicle membrane and was unable to diffuse across the bilayers (white arrows) to reach inner vesicles. This shows the suitability of the phospholipid-bound progestin to be used in live-cell experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CRG047 interaction with breast cancer cells membrane and activation of the kinase cascade</head><p>To further assess CRG047 incorporation to the cell membrane of living breast cancer cells, we incubated T47D cells with a physiologically relevant 10 nM concentration of CRG047 in PBS for 30 min. We visualized the incorporation of CRG047 by means of single molecule imaging of the fluorescent organic dye Nile Red under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF). We observed that the incorporation of CRG047 at such low concentrations yielded single molecules on the cell membrane of living T47D cells (see attached Video 1, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). To efficiently visualize the incorporation of CRG047, we performed high-density single molecule maps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4a</ref>) of Nile Red, reflecting not only that CRG047 is incorporated on the cell membrane but that it also diffuses laterally as expected from a lipid bilayer intercalating dye.</p><p>We proceeded to assess the activation of the MAPK signaling cascade exposing T47D cells to P4 or CRG047 compared to vehicle. We first tested the activation of ERK kinase activated phosphorylated PRS294P by means of a specific antibody using highly inclined and laminated optical sheet (HILO) fluorescence microscopy of an AlexaFluor 488 labeled secondary antibody. A significant fraction of cells showed a punctated fluorescence pattern characteristic of PR activation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4b</ref>). By calculating the cumulative density function (CDF) of the fluorescence intensity per nucleus of the antibody PRS294P (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4c</ref>), we determined that 77% or 22% of the cells were activated when exposed to 10 nM P4 or CRG047, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4d</ref>). We confirmed in cell extracts both ERK1/2 activation and PR phosphorylation when the cells were exposed to P4 or CRG047 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4e</ref>). Thus, these experiments show that the compound CRG047 binds to the cellular membrane of the breast cancer cells and is able to activate the ERK-dependent PR signaling cascade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functional response of the cells: gene regulation and cell proliferation through PR-chromatin interaction</head><p>To evaluate the nuclear response to the membrane-attached progestin, we used qRT-PCR to measure mRNA levels for genes known to be activated by P4, including cMyc, Snail1, TiPARP, and EGFR, as well as the chromosomally integrated reporter MMTV-luc. All these genes were significantly activated by 10 nM P4 and also by 10 nM CRG047 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5a</ref>).</p><p>We therefore performed a whole gene expression analysis of poly(A)-RNA by RNA-seq in cells exposed to 10 nM of either P4 or CRG047. After exposure to 10 nM P4, 458 genes were up-regulated and 199 were down-regulated, while upon exposure to 10 nM CRG047, 389 genes were up-regulated and 174 were down-regulated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). This indicates that CRG047 regulates a large number of genes comparable to those regulated by P4, though the extent of the regulation by CRG047 was less pronounced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4b</ref>, right panel). Note however that, in the absence of gene identities, it would be difficult to ascertain that both chemicals have similar effects on the cellular gene expression pattern. Even if a number of genes were activated/repressed by CRG047, neither GO nor KEGG Pathway analysis revealed any clear patterns of gene expression.</p><p>As a further indicator of biological response to progestin, we measured the incorporation of BrdU into DNA, an indicator of cells entering the S phase of the cell cycle. We shortly exposed T47D cells to 10 nM of either P4, CRG047 or vehicle, followed by incubation in hormone-free medium. We found that both P4 and CRG047 significantly activated DNA synthesis compared to vehicle exposure (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5d</ref>).</p><p>To explore whether this gene regulation by CRG047 was mediated by binding of PR to its known HREs near regulated genes, we performed ChIP-qPCR at P4 regulated genes after exposure to 10 nM P4 or CRG047. We found a significant binding of PR to the regulatory PREs in five P4 responsive genes including the promoter region of the MMTV-luc reporter (NucB). The effects of CRG047 were in the same direction than those of P4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5e</ref> for P4 and f for CRG047). Therefore, we conclude that the progestin-like compound can activate the cell response in a similar manner as progesterone.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neither CRG047 nor its putative hydrolysis product are detected within cell nuclei</head><p>To explore whether CRG047 did enter the cell nuclei, T47D cells were exposed shortly to 10 or 100 nM P4 or CRG047 and total cell extracts and nuclear extracts were subjected to quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). Analyses were performed in parallel for CRG047 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5a-d</ref>) or P4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5e-h</ref>). Although the limit of detection was below 1 pmol (not shown), neither CRG047 nor P4 could be detected in nuclear extracts (compare panels a, b for CRG047 and panels e, f for P4). Similar analyses were performed with the progesterone analogue R5020 (promegestone) (panels i-l).</p><p>To exclude that CRG049-the steroid metabolite of CRG047 hydrolysis -could be responsible for some of the observed effects, the levels of CRG047 and CRG049 in total extracts from cells exposed to 10 nM and 100 nM CRG047 were measured by MS. The results are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6</ref>. While CRG047 was clearly detected in the cell extracts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6a</ref>), CRG049 was indistinguishable from noise at the same concentrations both in nuclear and total cell extracts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">S6a</ref>). Thus, it seems unlikely that the hydrolysis of CRG047 was responsible for the observed effects in breast cancer cell function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Palmitoylated PR at Cys 820 is required for the response to CRG047</head><p>Given that other P4 binding proteins are known to inhabit the cell membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, in order to ensure that the mbPR was responsible for the action of CRG047, we inhibited palmitoylation with 10 µM 2-bromopalmitate (2-Br) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We found that this treatment effectively blocks the response.</p><p>of T47D to both P4 and CRG047 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>). In addition, we used a PR mutant in which the palmitoylation site (Cys-820) was mutated to Ala (PR C820A). This mutant PR does not integrate into the cell membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. We found that, when expressed in T47D cells deprived of wtPR that express a single MMTV promoter copy (TYML) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, PR C820A could not mediate the cell response to 10 nM P4 or CRG047 in terms of activation of P4-responsive genes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">S7a</ref>). Similar results were obtained when wtPR or PR C820A mutant were co-expressed along with the MMTV promoter plasmid in another cancer cell line defective in PR (U2OS cells) and exposed to P4 or CRG047 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7b</ref>). In addition, with U2OS cells expressing either the wtPR or the mutant PR C820A, only the wtPR-expressing cells activated the ERK kinase and led to PR phosphorylation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref> and<ref type="figure">d</ref>).</p><p>It could be argued that palmitoylation inhibitors would inhibit SRC/RAS association with the membrane, thus they should not be used as a valid evidence to support a role of PR palmitoylation. However, blocking palmitoylation during exposure to progesterone or CRG047 should have a strong effect on PR palmitoylation and a much smaller one on SRC/ RAS palmitoylation, which is not activated by progesterone. We conclude that CRG047 action on T47D cells require the anchoring of PR to the cell membrane via palmitoylation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The purpose of this work was to explore whether a membrane-attached progestin derivative could activate the cellular response of breast cancer cells to progestins without the requirement of the hormone penetrating into the cell and binding the intracellular PR. The results are compatible with this hypothesis, although we do not exclude other possible explanations.</p><p>In support of our hypothesis, the above results show that the progestin linked to a stable phospholipid (CRG047) binds the mbPR with high affinity and remains attached to the cell membrane during the time of exposure of the cells (30 min). Chemically, the amide bond linking progestin to the phospholipid is not hydrolyzed during exposure of the cells to CRG047 as the resulting compound (CRG049) cannot be detected in the cell extracts. Our designed compound CRG047 induces the activation of the ERK kinase pathway leading to phosphorylation of the iPR at S294, which results in PR binding to genomic PREs, regulation of the associated progesterone sensitive genes, and entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Finally, our data show that anchoring of PR to the cell membrane via palmitoylation at C820 is essential for CRG047 action.</p><p>In fact, it has never been demonstrated that the PR that binds to chromatin PREs upon exposure of breast cancer cells to 10 nM or to 50 pM P4 is actually carrying a bound hormone ligand <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, and we cannot demonstrate the presence of P4 in nuclear extracts of cells exposed to 10 nM P4. Thus, the main function of the hormone ligand could be to activate the kinase pathway via mbPR, leading to phosphorylation of the intracellular PR, detachment from chaperones, dimerization and transfer to the cell nucleus.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that our assays are focused on the initial response of the cells to hormone, as we did not dare to expose the cells to CRG047 for longer than 30 min. The reason was that we wanted to exclude the possibility that the mbPR could be reaching the cell interior during the metabolic processing of the membrane. This short exposure time may also be responsible for the low percentage of cells (~ 20%) that responded to CRG047, since judging from the experiments with phospholipid vesicles, binding of CRG047 increased after longer incubation times, most likely due to the fraction of compound forming micelles (not available for binding to the cell membranes) is only gradually being released. Nevertheless, even this short exposure time was sufficient to initiate the cell cycle in the next 16 h. Note that, in classical experiments with progesterone, the effects are measured after exposure to nM steroid concentrations for longer times (hours). Then, a large fraction of cells respond to the hormone. In this study we used lower concentrations and shorter exposure times to avoid membrane degradation or formation of membrane vesicles, this is probably the reason why only 20% of the cells responded.</p><p>A further limitation of our study is that we have not explored the binding of the compound CRG047 to other known membrane-attached progestin binding proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. PAQRs are seven-transmembrane-helix proteins that bind progesterone and adiponectin Q, and are expressed in many tissues including the nervous system. To our knowledge, these PAQRs receptors are not expressed in the T47D cell lines we have used for this study. Progesterone Membrane Components 1 and 2 (PGRMC1/2) are single-pass transmembrane receptors that bind progesterone, cortisol, androgens, cholesterol and heme <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. We have not explored the possible function of PGRMCs in response to progestins, but we have shown through the palmitoylation of PR mutants that the effects of CRG047 require the binding of PR to the membrane.</p><p>Finally, the strategy used in this study has not been tested in experiments in living animals, as the phospholipidcontaining compounds we used may bind many components of the blood and other fluids, making difficult their interaction with the target cells at the required low concentrations.</p><p>In any case, the relevance of the mbPR for the hormone response suggests that it could be a novel target for endocrine therapy of breast cancers. For instance, developing selective inhibitors of its palmitoylation, or blocking its interaction with the SRC kinase. It is very likely that ERα is bound to the cell membrane by a similar mechanism, since it shares the conserved palmitoylation signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Thus, a selective palmitoylation inhibitor would block the action of both estrogens and progestins. This strategy would require a better understanding of the complex formed by mbPR with ERα, the SRC kinase, and other associated proteins.</p></div>

Finally, from the histogram distributions of median intensity we obtained the CDF of ethanol-exposed samples and took the 95% median intensity, which we used to define the inactive/active threshold. A 5% threshold was taken as a reference for activation because 5% of cells were activated by vehicle. Thus, those cells with a median intensity per pixel larger than the threshold are considered to be active.
