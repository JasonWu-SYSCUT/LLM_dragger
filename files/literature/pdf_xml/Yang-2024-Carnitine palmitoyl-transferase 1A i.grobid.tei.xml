The virus infection-induced suppression of the host immune responses may lead to secondary infections by diverse pathogens, such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 virus (PI3V), bovine coronaviruses, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Histophilus somni, and Mycoplasma spp, which may consequently result in the life-threatening pneumonia known as bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), the most important disease in cattle <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Fulton et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jones, 1998)</ref>. In addition, the virus infection is closely associated with viral abortion storms in cattle farms in North America. Thus, BoHV-1 infection is causing great economic loss to the cattle industry worldwide. An early report indicates that BoHV-1 infection costs the US cattle industry approximately 3 billion dollars annually <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jones and Chowdhury, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>We have previously reported that BoHV-1 productive infection results in mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhu et al., 2016)</ref>, which may contribute to infection-induced tissue damage. However, the mechanisms concerning these findings are not well understood. It is well known that fatty acids are important energy sources, catabolized primarily by fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) in mitochondria. Since FAO produces more than three-fold as much ATP per mole as glucose oxidation, it is the preferred energy source for highly metabolized cells in physiological conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kastaniotis et al., 2017)</ref>. However, the abnormal FAO process is related to a series of diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(He et al., 2018)</ref>. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 A (CPT1A) is the key rate-limiting enzyme for the process of FAO <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Prip-Buus et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rasmussen and Wolfe, 1999)</ref>. Overexpression of the CPT1A protein was found to be related to the pathogenicity of diverse diseases. For example, it promotes the progression of ovarian cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Shao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tan et al., 2018)</ref>, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Yang et al., 2021)</ref>. Accumulating studies have indicated that CPT1A is an attractive therapeutic target for intervention of various diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Dai et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schlaepfer and Joshi, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Although the roles of FAO that played in virus infection have been extensively studied in various viruses, including fish nodavirus <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Huang et al., 2020)</ref>, vaccinia virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Greseth and Traktman, 2014)</ref>, influenza A virus <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(van Liempd et al., 2021)</ref>, and HIV-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Loucif et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Prip-Buus et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rasmussen and Wolfe, 1999)</ref>, the effects of CPT1A signaling on virus replication are poorly understood. So far, only one virus, Marek's Disease Virus (MDV), has been exclusively investigated regarding its interaction with the CPT1A <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Boodhoo et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we showed that BoHV-1 productive infection leads to depletion of CPT1A protein expression and re-localization of CPT1A protein. CPT1A-specific inhibitor ETO significantly reduced the virus-productive infection. Taken together, for the first time, we found that CPT1A may play an important role in BoHV-1 productive infection, which may affect the CPT1A signaling pathway.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">BoHV-1 infection has effects on CPT1A protein expression</head><p>Whether and how BoHV-1 productive infection affects CPT1A signaling has not been well characterized. To investigate whether CPT1A plays a role during BoHV-1 productive infection, we initially detected the steady-state levels of CPT1A protein following infection of bovine kidney (MDBK) cells, which is widely used for studying the virus replication mechanism. Our data indicated that CPT1A protein levels were gradually reduced following virus infection, particularly at later stages (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Quantitative analysis showed that at 16, and 24 h post-infection (hpi), the protein levels were reduced to 71.24% and 57.53% relative to the control, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). These data suggested that virus infection has effects on CPT1A protein expression.</p><p>We then determined whether this effect showed a cell type-specific phenomenon. The steady-state protein levels of CPT1A were examined in two further cell lines, A549 and Neuro-2A, infected with BoHV-1, which also support the virus productive infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cardoso et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Fiorito et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Qiu et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rodrigues et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Thunuguntla et al., 2017)</ref>. These two cells were infected at much higher MOI of 1 and 10, respectively, because the virus replication efficiency is much lower in these cell cultures. As observed in MDBK cells, BoHV-1 productive infection may lead to depletion of CPT1A protein in both A549 and Neuro-2A cells (Figs. <ref type="figure">1C</ref> and<ref type="figure">1E</ref>). After 24 and 36 h infection, CPT1A protein levels decreased to approximately 62.84% and 52.98%, respectively, compared to the mock-infected control in A549 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">1D</ref>). CPT1A protein levels were reduced to approximately 46.53% in Neuro-2A cells after infection for 36 h (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>). These data suggested that BoHV-1 productive infection leads to the depletion of CPT1A protein in a cell type-independent manner. Furthermore, MDBK and Neuro-2A cells were infected with increasing MOI ranging from 0.1 to 10 to detect the variation of CPT1A protein levels at 16 and 36 hpi. As a result, CPT1A protein levels gradually decreased, to an extent correlated with increasing MOI (Fig. <ref type="figure">1G</ref> and<ref type="figure">I</ref>). In MDBK cells, CPT1A protein levels were reduced to approximately 67.12%, 52.89%, and 32.38% following infection with MOI of 0.1, 1, and 10, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1H</ref>). In Neuro-2A cells, CPT1A protein levels were decreased to 76.88% and 49.05% following infection with MOI of 1 and 10, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1J</ref>). These data suggested that BoHV-1 productive infection leads to depletion of CPT1A protein in an MOI-specific manner, validating that the virus infection could specifically decrease CPT1A protein expression levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">BoHV-1 infection re-localized CPT1A protein</head><p>Since the later-stage virus infection significantly reduced CPT1A protein expression, we wondered whether virus infection influenced CPT1A subcellular localization. For that purpose, confocal microscopy was performed 24 h after infection. In mock-infected MDBK cells, CPT1A was primarily detected in the nucleus, which was evenly distributed and overlapped well with DAPI staining (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> upper panels). After virus infection, the nuclear CPT1A protein was relocalized, making it look like several adjoining clusters with irregular shapes. Unlike the mock-infected cells, nuclear CPT1A staining did not overlap well with that of DAPI, making DAPI stand out and readily observed (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> bottom panels). In addition, higher levels of CPT1A proteins were readily detected in virus-infected cytosol relative to that of mock-infected controls (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Of note, all these images were captured under the same conditions. Thus, we suggested that the virus infection may increase the accumulation of cytosol CPT1A.</p><p>Another independent method was employed to evaluate further the effects of virus infection on CPT1A localization in MDBK cells, in which cellular fractions of both cytosol and nucleus were purified using a commercial nucleus isolation kit and subjected to Western blotting. In consistency with what we observed in the IFA assay (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>), CPT1A protein can be detected in the cytoplasmic fractions by Western blot (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>). Relative to the mock-infected controls, CPT1A protein levels were decreased to approximately 47.79% in the nucleus and increased approximately 2-fold in the cytoplasm after viral infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">3B</ref>), confirming that virus infection increased accumulation of CPT1A in cytoplasm, which incorporated with the data of IFA assay. LaminA/C, a marker for nuclear protein, was not detected in the cytoplasmic fraction, and β-tubulin, a marker for cytoplasmic protein, was not detected in the nuclear fractions, suggesting that neither fraction was contaminated by the counterpart (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A</ref>), which validates the findings that virus infection leads to re-localization of CPT1A protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">BoHV-1 infection has no effects on the accumulation of CPT1A protein in mitochondria</head><p>A subset of CPT1A molecules reside in mitochondria and play an important role in βoxidation of long-chain fatty acids <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Samudio et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xu et al., 2003)</ref>. We wondered whether virus infection affects the accumulation of CPT1A proteins in mitochondria. For this purpose, cellular fractions of mitochondria were purified using a commercial kit and subjected to immunoblot to detect the CPT1A protein. As a result, the protein levels of CPT1A protein were not changed in virus-infected mitochondria relative to the mockinfected controls (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">CPT1A-specific inhibitor Etomoxir can reduce BoHV-1 virus replication</head><p>Etomoxir (ETO) is a chemical inhibitor of FAO that has irreversible effects on inhibiting CPT1A activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Xu et al., 2003)</ref>. To understand whether CPT1A signaling plays a role in BoHV-1 productive infection, the impact of ETO at a concentration ranging from 1 to 5 μM on virus productive infection was analyzed in MDBK cells after infection for 24 h. ETO at a concentration of 5 μM did not show cytotoxic effects on MDBK cell cultures in the designated conditions, as determined by the trypan-blue exclusion test described by Fiorito et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Fiorito et al., 2008)</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). As a result, relative to the DMSO control, 1 μM ETO had no effects on virus yield, while 2.5 or 5 μM ETO consistently reduced the virus production approximately by 0.9-and 1.5-log, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>). The effect of ETO on BoHV-1 infection was then examined in A549 and Neuro-2A cells. The virus titers were decreased to approximately 1.12-and 1.24-log by 2.5 or 5 μM ETO, respectively, in A549 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5C</ref>). While, in Neuro-2A cells, the virus titers were deceased to around 1-log by 5 μM ETO (Fig. <ref type="figure">5D</ref>). 5 μM ETO did not show cytotoxicity in either A549 or Neruo-2A cells after treatment for 24 and 36 h, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). So the decrease of virus titers was not because of cytocoticity. Taken together, the CAT1A inhibitor, ETO, significantly reduced BoHV-1 replication in three permissive cell lines, MDBK, A549, and Neuro-2A cells.</p><p>Then, the effects of ETO on BoHV-1 replication were extensively characterized in MDBK cells. In line with the virus titers, the viral genome copies were reduced to approximately 68.8% and 60.9% by ETO at a concentration of 2.5 and 5 μM, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>). These data consistently suggest that ETO can inhibit virus-productive infection.</p><p>The same as HSV-1, BoHV-1 gene expression is divided into three distinct phases during the lytic infection: immediate early (IE), early (E), and late (L) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Harkness et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Honess and Roizman, 1974)</ref>. The viral regulatory proteins of IE genes play critical roles in regulating the expression of both E and L genes during productive infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Mossman and Smiley, 1999)</ref>. The effects of ETO on viral IE gene expression were detected by using qRT-PCR. The mRNA levels of the detected viral IE genes of both bICP0 and bICP22 were reduced by 5 μM ETO, which were decreased to approximately 47.7% and 55.0%, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>). The inhibition of viral IE (bICP0 and bICP22) gene transcription corroborates the findings that ETO inhibits virus replication.</p><p>In addition, the effects of ETO on the expression of viral glycoprotein of both gC and gD were detected by Western blot. We found that ETO at all the detected concentrations decreased the protein expression of both gC and gD in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>). After treatment by 1, 2.5, and 5 μM of ETO, gC protein levels were reduced to approximately 70.11%, 41.22% and 26.85%, respectively. The gD protein levels were reduced to approximately 72.01%, 57.12%, and 42.31%, respectively, compared to the mock-treated control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). Then, we performed additional studies to detect ETO's effects on the expression of virion-associated proteins. For this purpose, MDBK cells were infected with BoHV-1 for 24 h and treated with either DMSO control or ETO at increasing concentrations. Then, the cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using a commercial antibody developed against BoHV-1 virions. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6E</ref>, the antibody readily recognized at least six virion-associated proteins with distinct molecular weights denoted by a, b, c, d, e, f, and g. The expression levels of all the detected viral proteins were reduced by ETO treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, bands denoted by e, f, and g were rarely recognized when the cell cultures were treated with 5 μM of ETO. These data indicate that ETO may affect the viral protein expression, which further confirms that ETO could inhibit the virus-productive infection.</p><p>Taken these data together, CPT1A-specific inhibitor ETO reduced virus productive infection in MDBK cells, differentially affected viral IE gene expression, and inhibited the protein expression of virion-associated proteins. Thus, CPT1A signaling may play an important role in the virus-productive infection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">ETO treatment rescued the depletion of nuclear CPT1A protein induced by virusproductive infection</head><p>Since our results demonstrated that CPT1A-specific inhibitor ETO inhibits virus-productive infection and virus infection leads to CPT1A protein depletion, further studies were performed to detect whether ETO affects CPT1A protein expression in the context of virus-productive infection. When the virus-infected MDBK cells were treated with ETO at increasing concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 μM, CPT1A protein levels that decreased by the virus infection at later stages were significantly restored by 5.0 μM of ETO (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Compared to the mock-treated virus-infected control, CPT1A protein levels increased by approximately 32.3% after treatment with 5.0 μM of ETO (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>).</p><p>Since virus infection reduced the accumulation of CPT1A protein in the nucleus and increased the accumulation in the cytoplasm, we investigated whether ETO affects CP1A accumulation in distinct cellular fractions. As a result, ETO treatment rescued the depletion of nuclear CPT1A protein induced by virus infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">7C</ref>). Relative to the mock-treated controls, CPT1A protein levels in the nucleus were increased by approximately 28.42% in the context of virus infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">7C</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). Of note, ETO had no effects on the accumulation of CPT1A protein in cytosol fractions in the context of virus infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">7D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>), though ETO reduced virus replication (Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>). We suggested that the altered accumulation of nuclear CPT1A protein by ETO treatment may correlate with the decreased virus replication and vice versa, which further confirmed that CPT1A signaling is involved in BoHV-1 productive infection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Accumulating studies have indicated that viruses may interrupt or use the host metabolism to facilitate efficient viral replication. Fatty acids may serve as precursors for ATP production via mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO), a well-defined metabolic pathway that serves as a primary bioenergetic source in many tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Ma et al., 2018)</ref>. CPT1A is a key rate-limiting enzyme of FAO <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schlaepfer and Joshi, 2020)</ref>. Whether CPT1A signaling is involved in BoHV-1 productive infection is not well understood. Previous reports indicate that BoHV-1 productive infection results in mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP depletion <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zhu et al., 2016)</ref>. Therefore, we want to address whether CPT1A signaling is involved in the virus infection. Here, for the first time, we showed that BoHV-1 productive infection may have effects on CPT1A signaling at later stages during virus infection by demonstrating that the virus productive infection reduced CPT1A protein levels and re-localized CPT1A protein (Figs. <ref type="figure">1</ref><ref type="figure">2</ref><ref type="figure">3</ref>). Importantly, it is well established that mitochondria-associated CPT1A protein is involved in the regulation of fatty acid metabolism via catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the transport of long-chain acyl-CoAs from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Prip-Buus et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rasmussen and Wolfe, 1999)</ref>. Here, we found that virus infection rarely affects the accumulation of CPT1A protein in the fractions of mitochondria (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). So, whether virus infection has effects on FAO-mediated fatty acids metabolism via manipulation of the CPT1A signal pathway is an interesting question, deserving extensive studies in the future.</p><p>It has been well characterized that Etomoxir (ETO), a chemical inhibitor, could specifically inhibit mitochondrial transportation of long-chain fatty acids via irreversible blockage of CPT1A activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Samudio et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Xu et al., 2003)</ref>. ETO treatment of virus-infected cells could significantly decrease the virus-productive infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), indicating that either CPT1A signaling or CPT1A-associated fatty acid metabolism may play an important role in virus-productive infection. Particularly, the CPT1A protein expression decreased following BoHV-1 productive infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), making the mechanism of how CPT1A signaling is potentially involved in regulating BoHV-1 productive infection complicated.</p><p>When referring to the literature, we noticed that ETO is generally applied at much higher concentrations to inhibit CPT1A activity than that we used here. For example, ETO at a concentration of 200 μM has been used to inhibit FAO in radiation-resistant glioblastoma (RR GBM) cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Samudio et al., 2010)</ref>. In this study, we found that ETO at a concentration of 5 μM could significantly reduce the virus titer and rescue CPT1A protein depletion attributed to the virus productive infection at later stages (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). Though chemical inhibitors at lower concentrations may have less off-target effects, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CPT1A protein expression remains to be performed to confirm the specific roles of CPT1A signaling that played in BoHV-1 replication when the DNA sequence of CPT1A gene of Bos taurus origin is available in GenBank.</p><p>MDV is an avian alphaherpesvirus. Among all the viruses, MDV is the only one virus to have been investigated whether CPT1A signaling is involved in the virus replication. Unlike BoHV-1, CPT1A signaling is not required for MDV replication because the ETO inhibitor does not affect MDV productive infection in cell cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Boodhoo et al., 2020)</ref>. Here, we found that BoHV-1 infection led to the depletion of CPT1A protein in the detected cell lines, including MDBK, A549, and Neuro-2A cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). And the chemical inhibitor ETO inhibits virus productive infection without cell specificity (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Together with that report, we suggested that the roles of CPT1A signaling that played in virus infection are virus-specific.</p><p>A given host protein's biological activities may vary with distinct subcellular locations. Currently, it has been reported that a subset of CPT1A protein is located in the mitochondrial outer membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Faye et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Gobin et al., 2003)</ref>, inside the mitochondrion <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gaudet et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Prip-Buus et al., 2001)</ref>, as well as the cell membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ghosh et al., 2010)</ref>. CPT1A protein in the mitochondria regulates the fatty acid metabolic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Prip-Buus et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rasmussen and Wolfe, 1999)</ref>. However, the biological functions of CPT1A protein in cytoplasmic membrane remain to be elucidated. Here, for the first time, we found that the CPT1A protein is abundantly expressed in the nucleus via two independent studies (Figs. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>). Though we currently do not know the biological activities of nuclear CPT1A implicated in either mock-infected cells or virus-infected cells, our data suggest that it is involved in the virus-productive infection because the morphology of nuclear CPT1A protein is changed following virus infection (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The accumulation of nuclear CPT1A protein is significantly reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>), which is reversed by ETO treatment which may partially account for the decreased virus yield (Figs. <ref type="figure">5</ref> and<ref type="figure">7</ref>). To clarify the mechanism of how the nuclear CPT1A protein was re-localized and whether this re-localization is implicated in virus infection are interesting issues deserving further studies in the future.</p><p>In summary, in this study, for the first time, we report an interplay between CPT1A signaling and BoHV-1 productive infection. For the first time, we found that a subset of the CPT1A protein resides in the nucleus, where the accumulation is significantly reduced following virus infection at later stages. CPT1A-specific inhibitor ETO significantly inhibits the virusproductive infection in cell cultures and reverses the depletion of nuclear CPT1A protein induced by virus infection. These data suggested that the CPT1A protein may play an important role in the virus-productive-infection in vitro. These findings will shed light on a new important notion for the interaction between BoHV-1 replication and CPT1A signaling, which may add more knowledge toward understanding the virus pathogenicity. BoHV-1 infection in MDBK cells decreased the expression of CPT1A protein. MDBK (A), A549 (C), and Neuro-2A(E) cells were either mock infected or infected with BoHV-1 at an MOI of 0.1, 1, and 10, respectively, as routinely did, and at indicated time points, the cell lysates were prepared for western blotting to detect CPT1A. β-Actin was probed and used as a protein loading control and subsequent quantitative analysis. (G and I) MDBK(G) and Neuro-2A(I) cells were either mock infected or infected with BoHV-1 at an MOI of 0.1, 1, and 10, respectively. After infection for 16 h and 36 h, cell lysates of MDBK and Neuro-2A cells were prepared and subjected to Western blotting to detect the CPT1A protein, respectively. (B, D, F, H, and J) The band intensity was analyzed with free software image J. In detail, the band intensity of CPT1A was initially normalized to β-Actin, and the fold change after infection was calculated compared to that of mock-infected controls, which were arbitrarily set as 100%. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments with error bars indicating standard deviations. Significance was assessed with a student t-test (*p &lt; 0.05, ns: not significant). Subcellular localization of CPT1A protein in BoHV-1-infected MDBK cells. MDBK cells were either mock infected (upper panels) or infected (bottom panels) with BoHV-1 (MOI = 0.1) for 24 h. Then, they were stained with an antibody against CPT1A (green). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (blue). Then, the immunostaining was visualized, and images were captured using confocal microscopy. These images are representative of those from three independent experiments.

Protein levels of CPT1A were detected by Western blotting. LaminA/C, a marker for nuclear protein, and β-tubulin, a marker for cytoplasmic protein, were detected as a protein loading control, respectively. (B) The band intensity was analyzed with free software image J. Band intensity of CPT1A was initially normalized to either LaminA/C or β-Actin, and the fold change after infection was calculated by comparison to that of mock-infected controls, which were arbitrarily set as 100%.

Significance was assessed with a Student's t-test t-test (ns: not significant). Effects of CPT1A-specific inhibitor ETO on BoHV-1 productive infection. (A) MDBK and A549 cells in 24-well plates were either mock-treated with DMSO control or with 5 μM of ETO for 24 h. Neuro-2A cells in 24-well plates were either mock treated with DMSO control or with 5 μM of ETO for 36 h. Then, cell viability was assessed by a Trypan-blue exclusion test. The cell number of mock-treated controls was arbitrarily set as 100%. MDBK(B), A549(C), and Neuro-2A(D) cells in 24-well plates were infected with BoHV-1 with MOI of 0.1, 1, and 10, respectively, along with treatment of either DMSO control or ETO at indicated concentrations. After infection for 24 h, the cell cultures of both MDBK and A549 cells were collected. After infection for 36 h, the cell cultures of Neuro-2A cells were collected. Then, virus titers were measured, and the results were expressed as TCID 50 /mL.  Effects of ETO on the expression and nucleus accumulation of CPT1A protein in virusinfected cells. (A) MDBK and in 60 mm dishes were mock infected or infected with BoHV-1 (MOI = 0.1) along with treatment of either vehicle control DMSO or ETO at indicated concentrations. After infection for 24 h, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot to detect CPT1A proteins. (C and D) MDBK cells in 100 mm dishes were either mock-infected or infected with BoHV-1 (MOI = 0.1), followed by mock treatment with DMSO control or 5 μM of ETO. After infection for 24 h, the cells were collected for isolation of both nucleus and cytosol fractions using a commercial kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, cat# P0027), following the manufacturer's protocol. Protein levels of CPT1A were detected from individual fractions by Western blotting. LaminA/C, a marker for nuclear protein, and β-tubulin, a marker for cytoplasmic protein, were detected as a protein loading control, respectively. (B and E) The band intensity was analyzed with free software image J. Data shown are representative results of three independent experiments with error bars indicating standard deviations.
