			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Background Abnormal activation of FAK is associated with tumor development and metastasis. Through interactions with other intracellular signalling molecules, FAK influences cytoskeletal remodelling, modulation of adhesion signalling, and activation of transcription factors, promoting migration and invasion of tumor cells. However, the exact mechanism that regulates these processes remains unresolved. Herein, our findings indicate that the S-palmitoylation of FAK is crucial for both its membrane localization and activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The palmitoylation of FAK in U251 and T98G cells was assessed by an acyl-PEG exchange (APE) assay and a metabolic incorporation assay. Cellular palmitoylation was inhibited using 2-bromopalmitate, and the palmitoylation status and cellular localization of FAK were determined. A metabolic incorporation assay was used to identify the potential palmitoyl acyltransferase and the palmitoylation site of FAK. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays, colony formation assays, and Transwell assays were conducted to assess the impact of ZDHHC5 in GBM. Additionally, intracranial GBM xenografts were utilized to investigate the effects of genetically silencing ZDHHC5 on tumor growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Inhibiting FAK palmitoylation leads to its redistribution from the membrane to the cytoplasm and a decrease in its phosphorylation. Moreover, ZDHHC5, a protein-acyl-transferase (PAT), catalyzes this key modification of FAK at C456. Knockdown of ZDHHC5 abrogates the S-palmitoylation and membrane distribution of FAK and impairs cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Taken together, our research reveals the crucial role of ZDHHC5 as a PAT responsible for FAK S-palmitoylation, membrane localization, and activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>These results imply that targeting the ZDHHC5/FAK axis has the potential to be a promising strategy for therapeutic interventions for glioblastoma (GBM).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>GBM is the most common primary malignant and lethal tumor in the central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. With an annual incidence of approximately 5.26 per 100,000 population <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, it accounts for approximately 80% of intracranial cancers. Currently, the main treatments for GBM are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The substantial genetic variability of this disease results in resistance to conventional treatments, despite recent improvements in these therapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Thus, there is an urgent need to uncover the mechanisms underlying the progression of GBM to develop more effective therapeutic strategies.</p><p>In the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), epithelial cells undergo a transformation into migratory and invaded cells, which play a vital role in tumor the invasion and progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In glioma, EMT plays a crucial role in initiation of angiogenesis, resistance to cell death, and stimulation of invasion and metastasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. During EMT, glioma cells transition into a mesenchymal phenotype, acquiring enhanced invasion and migration capabilities. This transition is characterized by the expression of EMT markers including N-cadherin, β-catenin, Snail and Slug, and the repression of epithelial markers including E-cadherin <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. In addition, several mesenchymal gene sets have been found to exhibit obvious correlation with the radioresistance profile which indicates that EMT plays a crucial role in radioresistance in GBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Accumulating evidence indicates that a highly sensitive molecular regulator of EMT could serve as a promising marker for glioma.</p><p>FAK is a member of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase family and plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Integrin clustering causes FAK to be recruited to newly generated focal adhesion sites, and various downstream effectors are phosphorylated after FAK activation, resulting in angiogenesis, cell migration, and cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Moreover, increased FAK protein levels have been reported in cancers derived from many tissues and in tumor cell lines, while FAK expression is undetectable or low in benign neoplasms and normal tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. While recent studies have confirmed FAK's involvement in tumor invasion and metastasis, the underlying mechanism by which FAK influences tumor cell EMT remains unclear.</p><p>Protein acyltransferases are distinguished by a conserved catalytic domain known as the Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) domain and control protein palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>, a prevalent and reversible lipid posttranslational modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, that involves the addition of a 16-carbon palmitoyl group to a cysteine residue through a thioester linkage <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Accumulating investigations have demonstrated that DHHC proteins and their substrates are essential for tumor cell EMT, migration, and invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. ZDHHC19 exhibits elevated expression in malignant cervical cancer tissues, consequently driving cervical cancer cells EMT, migration, and invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Moreover, ZDHHC1 overexpression was found lead to increased expression of epithelial markers like E-cadherin and Occludin, while reducing the expression of mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin and N-cadherin, indicating that ZDHHC1 acts as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting EMT in human cancers. A recent study revealed that ZDHHC5 increases the self-renewal capability of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), thereby actively contributing to the tumorigenicity of glioma cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. However, the mechanism by which ZDHHC5 affects the EMT process in GBM remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we observed the palmitoylation of FAK in GBM cell lines, and this modification was found to play a crucial role in the membrane localization of FAK. Through additional screening assays for palmitoyltransferases (PATs), we found that ZDHHC5 is the key enzyme responsible for the S-palmitoylation of FAK. Specifically, ZDHHC5 palmitoylates FAK at Cys456, ensuring its membrane localization and contributing to the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes the development of GBM.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Invasion, migration, and wound healing assays</head><p>Invasion and migration assays were carried out using Corning Matrigel invasion chambers. U251 and T98G cells were seeded into a 24-well plate, and chambers containing a membrane with or without a Matrigel coating were inserted. The upper compartments were filled with 100 µL serum-free medium, the lower compartments were filled with 500 µL of DMEM containing 30% FBS, the plates were incubation at 37 °C for a duration of 24 h. The cells in the lower compartments were fixed and stained with Giemsa after the floating cells had been removed from the incubation chamber. Images of cells were analysed using a Nikon inverted microscope.</p><p>In the wound healing assay, cells were seeded into a 6-well plate and cultured to approximately 90% confluence. Subsequently, the cells were detached from the plate surface by gently scraping with a 10-μl pipette tip and maintained in serum-free DMEM after being washed with PBS. Photographs were taken at 0 h and 24 h after wounding. Cell migration was quantified by calculating the percentage of the gap width at the indicated time relative to the gap width at 0 h. Statistical analysis was conducted using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software, and the results are presented as the average values obtained from three independent experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immunofluorescence (IF) staining</head><p>Cells were plated in confocal dishes and then fixed with paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, permeabilized and blocked with a solution containing 0.1% saponin, 5% BSA, and PBS for 30 min. The cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C in the dark. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with a secondary antibody at room temperature in the dark for 1 h. The confocal dishes were then mounted with DAPI-Aqueous (Abcam, #104,139). Subsequently, the images were acquired using laser confocal microscope and analysed using LAS X software.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S-palmitoylation maintains the membrane localization of FAK</head><p>To investigate the palmitoylation of FAK, we conducted a metabolic incorporation assay. Our findings confirmed that endogenous FAK undergoes S-palmitoylation, which occurs through the formation of thioester bonds that can be cleaved by treatment with hydroxylamine (HAM) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). Additionally, FAK can be labelled with high efficiency using Alk-C16 or Alk-C18 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). However, it exhibits lower labelling efficiency with C14 or C20 chain length probes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>), suggesting that FAK is predominantly modified with palmitoyl (C16) or stearoyl (C18) groups, while other chain lengths may have lower affinity or specificity for FAK. To further explore the palmitoylation levels of FAK, we used an acyl-PEG exchange (APE) assay. Upon treatment with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), a paninhibitor of PATs, the palmitoylation level of endogenous FAK was significantly decreased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>). Moreover, in pulse-chase experiments, we observed that the turnover half-life of FAK palmitoylation was approximately one hour, while the overall protein level remained (See figure on next page.) Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> S-palmitoylation maintains the membrane localization of FAK (A) FAK palmitoylation was examined in lysates obtained from U251 cells that were metabolically treated with a palmitoylation probe (50 μM alkynyl palmitic acid [PA]) for a duration of 4 h. The analysis was carried out through click reaction and streptavidin bead pulldown, both in the absence and presence of hydroxylamine (HAM). The subsequent immunoblotting (IB) was performed using the indicated antibodies. B FAK fatty acylation levels were investigated using different chemical reporters of fatty acylation, ranging from Alk-C14 to Alk-C20. The analysis involved the use of streptavidin bead pulldown to isolate acylated FAK, followed by IB. C APE assays were conducted to examine the levels of FAK palmitoylation in U251 cells following treatment with 50 μM 2-BP, both in the absence and presence of HAM. D FAK palmitoylation studies were conducted in U251 cells that were metabolically labeled with 50 µM alkynyl PA for a duration of 4 h. The cells were treated either in the absence or presence of PalB (5 μM). After the specified time period, the cells were collected for further analysis of FAK palmitoylation. E FAK palmitoylation was analyzed using the APE assay after fractionation to distinguish between the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions. ATP1A1 and α-tubulin were used as controls for the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Quantification of FAK palmitoylation percentage in the cytoplasm and membrane in APE assays. All the data are presented as the mean ± SD, n = three independent experiments, and two-tailed Student's t test. F U251 and T98G cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 50 μM 2-BP for 8 h, and the cellular localization of endogenous FAK was visualized using immunofluorescence staining. Scale bar, 1 μm. G U251 and T98G cells were subjected to treatment with either DMSO or 50 μM 2-BP for 8 h. The levels of FAK in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were evaluated using IB with the indicated antibodies. ATP1A1 and α-tubulin were used as membranal and cytoplasmic fraction controls, respectively. WCL refers to the whole-cell lysate, Mem refers to the membrane, and Cyto refers to the cytoplasm. H U251 and T98G cells were treated with DMSO, 50 μM 2-BP, or 2.5 μM PalB. Then, IB was performed for the indicated proteins. I U251 and T98G cells were pretreated with 2-BP or DMSO as a control and then incubated with cycloheximide (CHX). Immunoblotting was used to analyze the FAK and β-actin levels at the specified time points. J U251 and T98G cells were cotransfected with HA-Ub and treated with DMSO, 50 μM 2-BP, or 5 μM PalB for 8 h. U251 and T98G cells were subjected to IP-IB and IB for the indicated proteins unchanged, indicating that FAK S-palmitoylation is a dynamic process (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>). Interestingly, the acyl-PEG exchange (APE) assay showed that membrane FAK was substantially palmitoylated (~ 80%) compared to cytoplasmic FAK (~ 20%) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>), suggesting a direct correlation between the palmitoylation and membrane localization of FAK. To further verify this hypothesis, we monitored its cellular distribution following 2-BP treatment via immunofluorescence (IF) staining and found that FAK was redistributed from the membrane to the cytoplasm upon 2-BP treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>). Consistently, immunoblot analysis confirmed that the membrane localization of endogenous FAK was significantly reduced upon treatment with 2-BP in U251 and T98G cells, whereas the total level of FAK protein remained unchanged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>).</p><p>It is established that membrane-bound FAK is primed for activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Upon the association of FAK with the membrane, FAK autoinhibition is released, leading to efficient autophosphorylation at Tyr397 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>, which consequently activates downstream pathways of FAK, including the PI3K/AKT, ERK, and Paxillin signalling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Given the above results, we next determined whether palmitoylation is required for FAK activation. U251 and T98G cells treated with palmostatin B (PalB), an inhibitor of deacylating enzymes, exhibited elevated levels of phosphorylated FAK, AKT, ERK, and Paxillin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>). In contrast, inhibition of FAK palmitoylation with 2-BP dramatically decreased the levels of p-FAK, p-AKT, p-ERK, and p-Paxillin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1H</ref>). Additionally, we found that neither 2-BP treatment nor PalB treatment altered the decay rate or polyubiquitination level of FAK (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1I</ref> and<ref type="figure">J</ref>). Taken together, these data suggest that FAK undergoes S-palmitoylation, which is required for maintaining its membrane localization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ZDHHC5 regulates FAK S-palmitoylation by directly binding to FAK</head><p>To recognize the potential palmitoyl acyltransferase targeting FAK, a series of siRNAs designed to target PATs were introduced into U251 cells and we found that knockdown of ZDHHC5 but not other PATs almost completely abolished the S-palmitoylation of FAK, suggesting that ZDHHC5 is the major PAT that mediates FAK palmitoylation in GBM cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). Moreover, coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays revealed endogenous and exogenous interactions between ZDHHC5 and FAK (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). Furthermore, the GST pulldown assay and in vitro binding experiment showed that both WT ZDHHC5 and its catalytically inactive C134S mutant could interact with FAK (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">S2A</ref>), which demonstrated a direct interaction between ZDHHC5 and FAK. To identify the regions required for this interaction, we generated a series of truncation mutants of Myc-ZDHHC5 and Flag-FAK (Fig. <ref type="figure">2E</ref>). We found that ZDHHC5 interacts with FAK through an N-terminal sequence (amino acids 1 to 200). Remarkably, ZDHHC5 ΔDHHC had the same affinity for FAK as the full-length ZDHHC5 protein, suggesting that the ZDHHC5-FAK interaction is not dependent on the PAT activity of ZDHHC5 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2F</ref>). Accordingly, we generated four Flag-FAK truncation mutants lacking either the FERM domain, kinase domain, Pro-rich region, or FAT domain. The coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that Myc-ZDHHC5 could be immunoprecipitated by the Δkinase, ΔPro-rich region, and ΔFAT Flag-FAK truncation mutants. However, when FAK lacked the FERM domain, the interaction between ZDHHC5 and FAK was significantly diminished (Fig. <ref type="figure">2G</ref>). These results indicate that ZDHHC5 binds directly to FAK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ZDHHC5 maintains FAK membrane localization and activation via S-palmitoylation</head><p>To further confirm that ZDHHC5 regulates the S-palmitoylation of FAK, we performed a metabolic incorporation assay and an APE assay. Silencing ZDHHC5 abrogated FAK S-palmitoylation (Fig. <ref type="figure">3A-C</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">S3A</ref>), and this effect was reversed upon introduction of WT ZDHHC5, but not the ZDHHC5 C134S mutant (Fig. <ref type="figure">3D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). These findings indicate that the enzymatic activity of ZDHHC5 is crucial for the S-palmitoylation of FAK. Moreover, immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that ZDHHC5 knockdown by shRNA significantly inhibited the association of FAK with the membrane and that this association was restored by introduction of WT ZDHHC5, but not the C134S mutant (Fig. <ref type="figure">3F</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">S3B</ref>). The findings were additionally validated through cellular fractionation assays (Fig. <ref type="figure">3G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). Consistently, silencing ZDHHC5 significantly decreased the phosphorylation of FAK and the activation of downstream signalling pathways (Fig. <ref type="figure">3I</ref> and<ref type="figure">S3C</ref>). Taken together, these findings reveal that ZDHHC5 facilitates the S-palmitoylation of FAK, maintains its membrane localization and promotes its activation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FAK is palmitoylated at Cys456</head><p>To investigate the site of FAK palmitoylation mediated by ZDHHC5, we mutated all cysteine (C) residues in FAK to serine (S) and found that the overexpression of ZDHHC5 had no impact on the palmitoylation level of the FAK C456S mutant (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>), suggesting that ZDHHC5 mediates the palmitoylation of FAK at C456. Notably, the amino acid sequence surrounding C456 exhibits marked species conservation (Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). Consistent with this finding, the Flag-FAK C456S mutant displayed decreased a level of palmitoylation compared to that of Flag-FAK WT in U251 and T98G cells, as determined by the metabolic incorporation assay and APE assay (Fig. <ref type="figure">4C-E</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">S4A</ref>).</p><p>We next investigated whether palmitoylation of FAK at C456 regulates its membrane localization and activation. The cellular fractionation assay confirmed that the FAK C456S mutant predominantly localized in the cytoplasm compared to FAK WT, resembling the effects observed following treatment with 2-BP (Fig. <ref type="figure">4F</ref> and<ref type="figure">G</ref>). Moreover, we examined the activation of FAK and found that overexpression of FAK WT but not the FAK C456S mutant promoted the phosphorylation of FAK and the activation of downstream signalling pathways (Fig. <ref type="figure">4H</ref> and<ref type="figure">I</ref>). This finding suggests that ZDHHC5 mediates FAK Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> ZDHHC5 regulates FAK S-palmitoylation by directly binding to FAK (A) U251 cells infected with siRNAs targeting different zDHHC proteins.

Cell lysates were analyzed by Flag bead pulldown, followed by IB using the indicated antibodies S-palmitoylation at C456, which promotes FAK membrane localization and activation.</p></div>

The results of CCK8 assays demonstrated that knockdown of ZDHHC5 significantly suppressed cell proliferation (Fig. <ref type="figure">5B</ref>), which was further validated through colony formation assays (Fig. <ref type="figure">5C</ref>). Subsequently, we investigated the influence of the ZDHHC5 shRNA on the migration and Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> ZDHHC5 maintains FAK membrane localization and activation via S-palmitoylation (A) and (B) U251 and T98G cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying either control shRNA or ZDHHC5 shRNAs. Subsequently, the cells were metabolically labeled with 50 μM alkynyl PA for a duration of 4 h. The levels of FAK palmitoylation were analyzed by performing a click reaction and streptavidin bead pulldown, followed by IB. C An APE assay was performed to analyze FAK palmitoylation in ZDHHC5-knockdown U251 cells. D and E ZDHHC5-knockdown U251 and T98G cells were rescued with Myc-ZDHHC5 WT or ZDHHC5 C134S. FAK palmitoylation levels were analyzed by APE assay. F ZDHHC5-knockdown U251 cells were rescued with Myc-ZDHHC5 WT or ZDHHC5 C134S, and endogenous FAK cellular localization was visualized by immunofluorescence staining using antibodies against FAK. Scale bar, 1 μm. Z5, ZDHHC5 (G), and (H) ZDHHC5-knockdown U251 cells were rescued with Myc-ZDHHC5 WT or ZDHHC5 C134S. The levels of FAK in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were evaluated using IB with the indicated antibodies. I U251 cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing control shRNA or ZDHHC5 shRNAs and then subjected to IB for the indicated proteins invasion capacities of U251 and T98G cells. The woundhealing assays showed that U251 and T98G cells with ZDHHC5 knockdown exhibited a significantly reduced wound closure area after 24 h compared to the negative control (NC) cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5D</ref>). The transwell assays also showed consistent results that knockdown of ZDHHC5 resulted in significant decreases in the percentages of migrated and invaded cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5E</ref>). Moreover, our findings revealed notable reductions in the expression levels of N-cadherin, snail, slug, and β-catenin, along with an Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> FAK is palmitoylated at Cys456 (A) U251 cells were cotransfected with Flag-FAK WT or the indicated mutants and/or Myc-ZDHHC5.

FAK palmitoylation levels were assessed by click reaction and streptavidin bead pulldown, followed by IB. E U251 and T98G cells were transfected with Flag-FAK WT or Flag-FAK C456S. The APE assay was conducted to analyze FAK palmitoylation in U251 cells with the specified modifications. F and G U251 and T98G cells were transfected with Flag-FAK WT or Flag-FAK C456S. The levels of FAK in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions were evaluated using IB with the indicated antibodies. H and I U251 and T98G cells were transfected with Flag-FAK WT or Flag-FAK C456S. Then, IB was performed with the indicated antibodies increase in the E-cadherin level, in ZDHHC5-depleted U251 and T98G cells compared to the control cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5F</ref>). Remarkably, we found that these inhibitory effects of ZDHHC5 depletion were largely reversed by the overexpression of membrane-anchored and constitutively active mutants of FAK (CD2-FAK) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> but not by FAK C456S (Figure <ref type="figure">S5A-F</ref>). In addition, in a published dataset, CGGA, the mRNA level of ZDHHC5 was significantly higher in high-grade tumors (WHO III and WHO IV) than in low-grade tumors (WHO II) (Figure <ref type="figure">S5G</ref>). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the mRNA level of ZDHHC5 had prognostic value for patient survival (Figure <ref type="figure">S5H</ref>).</p><p>To further investigate the role of ZDHHC5-mediated FAK S-palmitoylation in regulating cell proliferation, invasion and EMT, we knock down FAK in U251 and T98G cells and reintroduce Flag-FAK WT or FAK C456S mutant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S6A</ref>). The CCK8 assays revealed a notable reduction in cell proliferation upon FAK knockdown. This effect was reversed by the reintroduction of FAK WT, but not FAK C456S (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S6B</ref>), as further confirmed by colony formation assays (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S6C</ref>). Moreover, the decreased ability of invasion and migration caused by FAK silencing was rescued by FAK WT, but not by FAK C456S (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S6D-G</ref>). These results demonstrate that ZDHHC5-mediated FAK S-palmitoylation promotes GBM cell proliferation and EMT.</p></div>

Bioluminescence imaging revealed that ZDHHC5 depletion significantly decreased tumor growth in mice following the injection of U251 and T98G cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). This intervention led to a considerable increase in the survival time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). Moreover, the expression of EMT-associated proteins, such as Snail, Slug, and β-catenin was markedly downregulated upon ZDHHC5 knockdown, as demonstrated by the IHC assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). However, reconstitution of ZDHHC5 WT but not ZDHHC5 C134S prevented these alterations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">6A-F</ref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate that ZDHHC5 is required for GBM carcinogenesis.</p></div>

Both the protein level of ZDHHC5 and S-palmitoylation level of FAK were markedly elevated in glioma tissue compared to normal tissue (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>).</p></div>

This observation led to the hypothesis that proper localization of FAK to the membrane plays a critical role in facilitating its related biological processes. Here, we show that ZDHHC5 mediates the S-palmitoylation of FAK at Cys456 to maintain the membrane binding of FAK. Furthermore, the autophosphorylation of membranelocalized FAK and activation of downstream signaling pathways are increased, consequently promoting GBM development (Fig. <ref type="figure">7D</ref>).

The S-palmitoylation of FAK was previously discovered via proteomic analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. However, the impact of S-palmitoylation on the function of FAK remains unexplored. In this study, we determined that ZDHHC5-mediated S-palmitoylation of FAK is important for its biological function, especially in regulating its membrane localization and phosphorylation in human GBM cells. Importantly, in our study, the palmitoylation-deficient FAK mutant was not able to localize normally at the cell membran, which resulted in a decrease in its phosphorylation, Significantly, our results revealed that knockdown of ZDHHC5 effectively suppressed the migration, invasion, and proliferation of GBM cells in vitro, and inhibited GBM development in vivo.

However, it is not yet clear whether palmitoylation is associated with EMT. In this study, we found that GBM cell migration and invasion dramatically decreased via suppression of EMT following ZDHHC5 knockdown.
