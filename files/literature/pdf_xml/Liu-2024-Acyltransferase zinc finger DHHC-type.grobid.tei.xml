			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The significant regulatory role of palmitoylation modification in cancer-related targets has been demonstrated previously. However, the biological functions of Nrf2 in stomach cancer and whether the presence of Nrf2 palmitoylation affects gastric cancer (GC) progression and its treatment have not been reported. Several public datasets were used to look into the possible link between the amount of palmitoylated Nrf2 and the progression and its outcome of GC in patients. The palmitoylated Nrf2 levels in tumoral and peritumoral tissues from GC patients were also evaluated. Both loss-of-function and gain-of-function via transgenic experiments were performed to study the effects of palmitoylated Nrf2 on carcinogenesis and the pharmacological function of 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) on the suppression of GC progression in vitro and in vitro. We discovered that Nrf2 was palmitoylated in the cytoplasmic domain, and this lipid posttranslational modification causes Nrf2 stabilization by inhibiting ubiquitination, delaying Nrf2 destruction via the proteasome and boosting nuclear translocation. Importantly, we also identify palmitoyltransferase zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 2 (DHHC2) as the primary acetyltransferase required for the palmitoylated Nrf2 and indicate that the suppression of Nrf2 palmitoylation via 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), or the knockdown of DHHC2, promotes anti-cancer immunity in vitro and in mice model-bearing xenografts. Of note, based on the antineoplastic mechanism of 2-BP, a novel anti-tumor drug delivery system ground 2-BP and oxaliplatin (OXA) dual-loading gold nanorods (GNRs) with tumor cell membrane coating biomimetic nanoparticles (CM@GNRs-BO) was established. In situ photothermal therapy is done using near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation to help release high-temperature-triggered drugs from the CM@GNRs-BO reservoir when needed. This is done to achieve photothermal/chemical synergistic therapy. Our findings show the influence and linkage of palmitoylated Nrf2 with tumoral and peritumoral tissues in GC patients, the underlying mechanism of palmitoylated Nrf2 in GC progression, and novel possible techniques for addressing Nrf2-associated immune evasion in cancer growth. Furthermore, the bionic nanomedicine developed by us has the characteristics of dual drugs delivery, homologous tumor targeting, and photothermal and chemical synergistic therapy, and is expected to become a potential platform for cancer treatment.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Stomach cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the world, and it is well established that about 60 % of new signet-ring cell carcinoma cases occur in East Asia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. Early gastric cancer clinically has no characteristic features, and diagnosis primarily relies on endoscopic observation and identification of changes in pattern. Though the molecular mechanism revealing the pathogenesis of stomach cancer has been well investigated, further study is still necessary to search for novel and effective therapeutic strategies. Recently, epidemiological studies have found that patients with Helicobacter Pylori infection or high-nitrate diet intake may be an inducement or co-acting factor for stomach cancer, as its existence increases the risk of processing stomach tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. Gastric carcinoma frequently exhibits rapid progression, a poor response to therapeutic strategies, and high mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The pathogenesis of gastric cancer and its associated tumorigenesis has not been fully understood, but genetic, immunological, and environmental factors are regarded as critical positions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>Increasing reports have indicated that inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can result in upregulated oxidative stress through the inactivation of antioxidative stress signaling and activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, including the nuclear factor erythroid 2related factor 2/kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Nrf2/Keap1) axis, signal transducer and activator of transcription family (STATs), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), signal transducer and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs), synergistically promoting cancer cell survival and tumorigenesis progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Nrf2, a key regulator of oxidative stress, is considered the main regulator that governs cellular homeostasis during oxidative stress. During homeostasis conditions, Nrf2 activity is principally regulated by the redox sensor protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). The anti-inflammatory effects of most electrophilic Nrf2 activators are partly Nrf2-independent and include inhibition of other inflammatory mediators, such as the innate immune kinase interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Besides, KEAP1 serves as a sensor for endogenous and exogenous electrophiles and oxidants due to it containing several highly reactive cysteine residues that, upon chemical modification, prevent its ability to target NRF2 for degradation, leading to NRF2 accumulation and upregulation of a large network of cytoprotective proteins. Both NRF2 and KEAP1 can undergo post-translational modifications and interact with other proteins that affect their functions. Thus, in addition to NRF2, KEAP1 has multiple other binding partners, which in turn have roles in a plethora of cellular processes.</p><p>Abnormal Nrf2 signaling was continuously observed in a series of tumors, including gastric cancer, which was involved in carcinogenesis and carcinogenic ogression. Moreover, previous reports also demonstrated that the persistent NRF2 activation by agonist or transgenemediated Nrf2 overexpression can significantly increase metastasis and proliferation of tumor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Nevertheless, the regulatory functions of immune factors and Nrf2 signaling, particularly their corresponding underlying molecular mechanisms, are not fully understood. In particular, recent reports with different degrees of evidence have found that the risk of gastric cancer is markedly correlated with the Nrf2 signaling pathway 15, 16. Interestingly, during the progression of tumorigenesis, an increase in Nrf2 abundance in the cytoplasm significantly suppressed the degradation of Nrf2 itself, followed by an acceleration of Nrf2 trafficking and nuclear translocation. These findings also further illustrate that under different physiological pathological conditions, Nrf2 may have a variety of different posttranslation modifications that synergistically or antagonistically determine its protein fate.</p><p>Among a series of forms of protein chemical modifications, palmitoylation exhibits a decisive role in regulating a series of functional proteins. Posttranslational S-palmitoylation catches C16 fatty acid palmitate (PA) to the cysteine (Cys) residues of the anchored protein and governs distinct functions of targeted proteins under various pathological and physiological conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Importantly, palmitoylation has been determined to govern the targeted protein localization and trafficking. This biological process is dependent on catalysis by an acyltransferase family known as Zinc finger-aspartate-histidine-his tidine-cysteine (DHHC)-CRD (cysteine rich domain)-type palmitoyl acyltransferases. However, it is largely unknown whether palmitoylation participates in posttranslational modification of Nrf2 and the effects on Nrf2 function.</p><p>In this work, we uncovered that Nrf2 is posttranslationally S-palmitoylated at the C514 residue by the DHHC2 palmitoyltransferase, which promotes its stabilization and nuclear translocation. Gastric carcinoma with high levels of DHHC2 promoted palmitoylated Nrf2 abundance, and this modification blocked Nrf2 ubiquitin-proteasomerelated degradation via the removal of ubiquitination chains, thus increasing gastric carcinoma growth and decreasing ROS levels. Destabilisation of the palmitoylation of Nrf2 by DHHC2 deficiency in gastric tumor cells or by 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), a general suppressor of protein S-palmitoylation, retarded gastric carcinoma growth via destabilisation of Nrf2 signaling, thus also indicating a potential and promising therapeutic strategy for the therapeutic management of stomach carcinoma. More importantly, in light of the anti-cancer effect of 2-BP on stomach cancer, we constructed biomimetic cytomembrane-coating GNP nanoparticles with 2-BP and an OXA dual-drug delivery system. In response to near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, an in situ photothermolysis was performed, which subsequently operated hyperpyretic release-related on-demand drugs controlled-release from the CM@GNRs-BO reservoir to conclude a synergistic photothermal/ chemotherapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Nrf2 can be palmitoylated, and S-palmitoylated Nrf2 maintains its expression</head><p>To explore whether palmitoylated Nrf2 was involved in gastric carcinoma progression, we first detected its expression profiles alterations upon treatment of cells with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), a general inhibitor of protein palmitoylation challenge. When human NCI-N87 cells were exposed to 2-BP to downregulate palmitoylated proteins, the levels of Nrf2 protein expression markedly reduced in both dose-(Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>) and time-dependent manners (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Inversely, significant upregulation in palmitoylation by palmostatin B (Palm B) or palmostatin M (Palm M), the inhibitor of depalmitoylase enzymes, elevated Nrf2 protein levels in NCI-N87 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). Such effects of 2-BP, ABD957, Palm B and Palm M on Nrf2 expression were further evaluated by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure">1E</ref>). Also, cultured NCI-N87 cells treated with cycloheximide (CHX) treatment confirmed that interdiction of palmitoylation by 2-BP challenge promoted Nrf2 degradation, therefore decreasing its protein abundance, while ABD957, Palm B and Palm M increased Nrf2 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">1F</ref>). Considering the effects of 2-BP on reduction of Nrf2 expression, click chemistry assay was employed to visualize the palmitoylated Nrf2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1G</ref>). Indeed, marked palmitoylation of Nrf2 was observed by the streptavidin beads-mediated pull down and western blotting analysis. In addition, to study the effects of palmitoylated Nrf2 on oxidative stress in cancer cells, suppression of Nrf2 palmitoylation by increasing doses of 2-BP downregulated mRNA levels profiles of antioxidant-related Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, GCLC and GCLM genes, but upregulated ROS levels in SNU-1 and NCI-N87 cells (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Similar results were also observed in SNU-1 and NCI-N87 cells, where 2-BP administration led to long-term increases in ROS levels and decreases in transcriptional levels of genes associated to antioxidants (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">1C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). On the contrary, SNU-1 and NCI-N87 cells treated with inhibitors of depalmitoylase enzymes (Palm B or Palm M) reduced ROS production, accompanied by increase of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, GCLC and GCLM genes mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1E-L</ref>). The above results suggested that Nrf2 expression is stabilized by S-palmitoylation, and increased palmitoylation contributed to reduction in ROS production in vitro.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Recognition of the palmitoylation site in Nrf2</head><p>Considering the critical role of palmitoylation in the regulation of Nrf2 stabilization, this compelled us to identify the definite palmitoylated site of Nrf2. The predicted position of the palmitoylation site on Nrf2 for Homo sapiens and Mus musculuswas studied with a conjoint analysis of GPS-Palm software (MacOS_20,200,219) (The CUCKOO Workgroup, http://gpspalm.biocuckoo.cn/), and MDD-Palm algorithm (http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/MDDPalm/) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Both algorithms coincidentally predicated and provided Top 6 palmitoylation sites for Nrf2 with different confidence intervals and quality scores. Of note, cysteine 514 (C514) of human Nrf2 and cysteine 506 (C506) of mouse Nrf2 in the Neh1 domain were predicted to be the most likely and reliable protein palmitoylation modification sites (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). These cysteine residues showed strong conservation in different species (Fig. <ref type="figure">2C</ref>). The replacement of the C514 residue by serine strictly blocked the palmitoylation of Nrf2, as indicated by the Click-iT chemistry assay (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). The C514S mutant dramatically reduced Nrf2 protein expression profiles (Fig. <ref type="figure">2E-G</ref>). The Nrf2 with C514S mutant concurrently promoted its degradation during CHX treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure">2H</ref>), therefore decreasing the levels of the remaining Nrf2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2I</ref>), similar to the effect of 2-BP administration. Given the identification of C514 as the key site for Nrf2 palmitoylation, we wonder whether Nrf2 with the C514 mutant affected ROS production in tumor cells. As expected, inconsistent with Nrf2 WT, reduced antioxidant-related Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, GCLC and GCLM genes at mRNA levels, decreased glutathione (GSH) contents, and elevated ROS contents were significantly observed in SNU-1 and NCI-N87 cells with Nrf2 C514S overexpression (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">2A-D</ref>), as determined by qPCR analysis and DCFH-DA staining assay. However, no marked changes in ROS contents were detected in the above-mentioned cells with Nrf2 C325S, Nrf2 C199S, Nrf2 C199S, Nrf2 C242S and Nrf2 C422S overexpression, compared to the Nrf2 WT group (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2E</ref>). These results indicated that cysteine 514 is a key site for Nrf2 palmitoylation, and Nrf2 with the C514S mutant lost its ability to reduce ROS production and boost the endogenous antioxidant system in tumor cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Palmitoylation-stabilized Nrf2 retards its proteasome degradation</head><p>Previous reports have indicated that stable overexpression of Nrf2 resulted in enhanced resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin, doxorubicin and etoposide. Inversely, downregulation of the Nrf2-dependent response by overexpression of Keap1 or transient transfection of Nrf2-small interfering RNA (siRNA) rendered cancer cells more susceptible to these drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Thus, we suspected that Nrf2 may have a variety of different posttranslation modifications that determine its protein fate over the course  of distinct physiological and pathological conditions. Accordingly, with these regards, we investigated the effects of palmitoylated Nrf2 on its ubiquitin-proteasome degradation progression. The enhanced degradation of palmitoylation of Nrf2 with the C514S mutant could be interdicted by the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref>), but not by the lysosomal inhibitors chloroquine, NH 4 Cl or the autophagy suppressor 3-methyladenine (3-MA).</p><p>To determine the proteasome-dependent manner, palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP was used to block the endogenous Nrf2 palmitoylation in NCI-N87 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>), and evaluated the functional effects of a series of diverse indicated inhibitors on distinct degradation signals. Coincidentally, decreased stabilization of Nrf2 induced by 2-BP-triggered depalmitoylation could be significantly abolished by MG132 and by bortezomib, but not chloroquine, NH 4 Cl and 3-MA, suggesting that there may be antagonistic effects between ubiquitination and palmitoylation to regulate the stability of Nrf2. Notably, Nrf2 has been confirmed to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome previously, thereby blocking its trafficking to the nucleus <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. To investigate the functional effects of depalmitoylation on Nrf2 nuclear translocation, major elements for proteasome assembly, including PSMD1, PSMD4, PSMD7, PSMA1, and PSMB5  (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3C</ref>) were employed to study their colocalization changes with Nrf2 over the course of depalmitoylation. Indeed, treatment with 2-BP largely promoted the colocalization of Nrf2 with the 26 S proteasome while upregulating its colocalization with the 19 S subunit and 20 S subunit aggregation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>), as evidenced by the immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, interruption of palmitoylation in Nrf2 with the C514S mutant markedly increased the colocalization of Nrf2 with the proteasome (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>) in the investigated gastric cancer cell lines. These data suggested that depalmitoylated Nrf2 downregulated its stabilization and accelerated proteasome-related degradation progression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Acetyltransferase DHHC2 is required for Nrf2 palmitoylation, and DHHC2 activity is positively correlated with stomach cancer progression in human</head><p>Considering palmitoylation as a key posttranslational modification of Nrf2 in tumor cells, we next inquired which palmitoyltransferase exerts a major role in controlling Nrf2 palmitoylation during stomach cancer progression. To investigate the involvement of DHHC2 in stomach cancer, we detected its levels in tissues obtained from human patients with gastric cancer (stages 1-4) phenotypes and used an in vitro assay (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>). Indeed, the analysis of the top 4 distinguishable expressed candidates, including DHHC2, DHHC5, DHHC18, and DHHC23, was highlighted in the intersection of these experiment groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B</ref>). To deeply explore this, human NCI-N87 cells with different DHHCs knockout levels were established, to evaluate Nrf2 protein expression profile changes. Significant reduction in Nrf2 could be observed in DHHC2-deficient cells, but not at the level of other DHHCs members (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4C</ref>). In addition, all the indicators met the selection criteria for the intersection screening, among which Nrf2 and DHHC2 displayed the marked upregulation in the patients with gastric cancer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4D</ref>). The additional multiple linear regression, pearson multiple correlation analysis and histological analysis further determined the positive correlation of DHHC2 expression with clinic gastric cancer (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4E-H</ref>). Intriguingly, DHHC2 was identified as the major palmitoyltransferase for Nrf2, which did affect Nrf2 stabilization and palmitoylation in DHHC2 deficiency or 2-BP challenge (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4I</ref> and<ref type="figure">J</ref>). Coincidently, invalidation of palmitoylation by C514S decreased the coexpression of Nrf2 and DHHC2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4K</ref>). Given the possible tight correlation of DHHC2 with stomach cancer progression, to explore whether DHHC2 expression changes were involved in this process, we then analyzed the correlation of DHHC2 expression with gastric carcinoma (STAD) by bioinformatics analysis. The Oncomine database, PrognoScan database and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) database confirmed that DHHC2 expression in human patients with STAD phenotype was significantly increased compared with normal controls (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4A</ref>). Also, abnormal elevated DHHC2 expression markedly associated with increased tumor immune infiltration, reduced survival rates of patients, and dysfunctional Nrf2 activity (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4B-D</ref>). Of note, DHHC2 showed positive expression in clinical stomach cancer samples and weak expression levels in the normal tissues in histological analysis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4E</ref>). Moreover, patients with STAD expressing high DHHC2 showed poorer survival rates than that of the patients with low DHHC2 expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4F</ref>). Consistently, in our cohort, patients with STAD exhibited strong DHHC2 expression during observation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4G</ref>). qPCR and western blotting assays confirmed that DHHC2 expression at gene and protein levels were remarkably upregulated in tumor samples compared with the paired normal tissue from our cohort (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4H</ref>). Additionally, the enrichment score of each immune cell type in STAD was further evaluated, we noted the major infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which showed a positive relation with DHHC2 expression (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Also, the neutrophils' infiltration level had a markedly positive correlation (Spearman R = 0.335, p &lt; 0.001) with DHHC2 expression and was dramatically higher in the DHHC2 high-expression group (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). We also determined a positive correlation between DHHC2 expression and neutrophils' markers such as CD44 and CD55 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5E</ref>). The following KEGG assay results indicated that PPAR signaling and growth factor activity terms were markedly enriched (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5F</ref>). To further investigate the signaling and pathways influenced by DHHC2, we conducted correlation analysis between DHHC2 and all other mRNAs in STAD using TCGA datasets. The top 29 genes were exhibited in a heatmap as shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5G</ref>, including Nrf2 and MMP14, which are key molecules involved in inflammatory cell infiltration, cell proliferation and EMT processes. As expected, positive correlations between DHHC2 expression and MyD88, TLR4, RELA (NF-κB p65), TWIST, ZEB1, VEGFA and VEGFB expression were observed in STAD patients (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5H-J</ref>). A potential protein interaction between DHHC2 and Nrf2 was identified by the GENEMANIA online datasets (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5K</ref>). The qPCR and western blotting assays thereafter confirmed that DHHC2 knockdown significantly decreased Nrf2 and MMP14 gene and protein expression levels in SNU-1 and NCI-N87 cells (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5L</ref> and<ref type="figure">M</ref>). These findings demonstrated that DHHC2 upregulation might be associated with STAD progression via regulation of cell proliferation and the EMT process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5.">DHHC2-mediated S-palmitoylation of Nrf2 promotes its nuclear translocation</head><p>Having the DHHC2 as the major palmitoyltransferase for Nrf2, we next investigated the effects of DHHC2 on Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Also, ectopically expressed DHHC2 in different stomach cancer cell lines elevated Nrf2 protein expression and accelerated its cellular nuclear translocation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). Considering the interaction between DHHCs and their substrates, we inquired whether DHHC2 interact with Nrf2 in tumor cells. Indeed, Co-IP studies indicated that direct binding between DHHC2 and Nrf2 could be remarkably observed in ectopic expression of DHHC2 in human NCI-N87 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5F</ref>). In addition, given the determination of C514 as the key site for Nrf2 palmitoylation, we wonder whether C 16 -catched S-palmitoylation primarily contributed to chemical modification for Nrf2. Thus, a series of alkyl-labeled fatty acylation including alk-C 14 , alk-C 16 , alk-C 18 and alk-C 20 were used to study this biological process. The Nrf2 can be marked effectively by palmitoylation (with alk-C 16 ) labels, but much less-efficiently marked by labels with alk-C 14 chain lengths, stearoylation (alk-C 18 ) or alk-C 20 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>), this indicating that C 16 -catched S-palmitoylation are the main acyl groups for Nrf2 chemical modification. Having the C514S mutation as the key site of Nrf2 palmitoylation, we next examined functional effects of these mutants on C 16 -catched S-palmitoylation over the course of alkynyl palmitic acid (alk-C 16 ) treatment. As expected, Nrf2 with human C514S mutation significantly abolished palmitoylation (with alk-C 16 ) labels, as supported by streptavidin pull-down analysis, which further revealed that human C514S was required for S-palmitoylation of Nrf2 protein (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5I</ref>). Moreover, to further visualize Nrf2 palmitoylation in the presence of DHHC2, similar to the above protocol, we used the alk-C 16 as a metabolic sign to examine the effects of DHHC2 on palmitoylated Nrf2 and its nucleus translocation. Incubation with NH 2 OH markedly suppressed palmitoylation levels in Nrf2, indicating that upregulation of palmitoylated Nrf2 mainly occurred on cysteine and was induced by DHHC2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5J</ref>). Fractionation analysis in DHHC2 WT or DHHC2-deficient NCI-N87 cells further evidenced that DHHC2mediated palmitoylation of Nrf2 elevated the component of the modified Nrf2 protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus but not in the membrane components (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5K</ref>). The above findings consistently indicated that DHHC2 as a major palmitoyltransferase involved in occurrence of palmitoylated Nrf2, and its activity was positively correlated with stomach cancer progression. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6.">Nrf2 is required for DHHC2 targeting function, and palmitoylationstabilized Nrf2 is less subjected to its ubiquitination degradation</head><p>Given the role of DHHC2 in regulating the Nrf2 signal, the above obtained in vivo and in vitro results compelled us to study another critical issue, whether and how DHHC2 directly interacted with Nrf2 in vitro. In line with prime binding analysis in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5F</ref>, following Co-IP assay indicated that exogenously expressed DHHC2 did interact with Nrf2 and vice versa, in transfected SNU-1 and NCI-N87 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Interaction analysis also showed that the DHHC-CRD domain of DHHC2 was essential for binding to Nrf2. The Co-IP analysis with corresponding DHHC2 mutants further revealed that DHHC2 without the DHHC-CRD domain has no ability to interact with Nrf2. Thus, the DHHC-CRD domain of DHHC2 contributed to protein interaction with Nrf2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). Also, the inhibition of Nrf2 palmitoylation by 2-BP or DHHC2 deletion resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of HO-1 and NQO1 (critical targets of Nrf2) protein abundance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6E</ref> and<ref type="figure">F</ref>). These results revealed that depalmitoylation of Nrf2 could affect downstream signaling events of the Nrf2 transcriptional activity. Notably, palmitoylation has been shown to coordinate targeted proteins stabilization by obstructing ubiquitination-related degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Thus, we inquired whether ubiquitination of Nrf2 could be interrupted by DHHC2-mediated palmitoylation, followed by antioxidant-associated signaling activation. As expected, reduction of palmitoylation by 2-BP dramatically upregulated the ubiquitin of Nrf2 through K48 linkage, and ablation of DHHC2 in NCI-N87 cells led to a similar observation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6G</ref>). Subsequently, given the important role of DHHC2 in the regulation and catalysis of palmitoylation, we screened amino acid sequences of the DHHC domain of DHHC2 in various species and underlined a very conserved site in DHHC2 (C154). Indeed, in NCI-N87 cells, DHHC2 with C154A mutant did lose its catalytic function in the suppression of K48-linked Nrf2 ubiquitination and Nrf2 signaling activation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6H-K</ref>, Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6A-D</ref>), and this process of ubiquitination was also significantly downregulated by AdshUsp15 (deubiquitinating enzyme 15) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">6L</ref> and<ref type="figure">M</ref>). The above results did reveal that the C154 site in the DHHC domain of DHHC2 is required for its biological catalytic function and modulation of Nrf2 palmitoylation.</p><p>Having the positive correlation of DHHC2-Nrf2 axis with gastric carcinoma development, we further explored the effects of DHHC2-Nrf2 signaling on tumor cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Indeed, the Nrf2 expression was significantly restrained in shDHHC2-transfected SNU-5 and OCUM-1 cells, as validated by qPCR and immunoblotting (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">7A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). The additional CCK-8 and colony formation assays confirmed that DHHC2 knockdown significantly restrained the proliferative capacity of stomach cancer cell lines compared with the shControl group (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">7C-E</ref>). The transwell analysis demonstrated that DHHC2 silencing markedly decreased the invasion and migration of tumor cells, compared to the corresponding control group (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">7F</ref> and<ref type="figure">G</ref>). As expected, EMT-related markers including Vimentin, N-cadherin, ZEB1 and MMP2 were strongly decreased in SNU-5 and OCUM-1 cells, while E-cadherin expression was highly elevated (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7H</ref>). Moreover, in vivo experiments confirmed that DHHC2 suppression efficiently reduced the tumor growth rates and tumor weights in the established mice bearing OCUM-1 tumor model (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">7I</ref> and<ref type="figure">J</ref>). These results verified that DHHC2 absence contributed to the suppression of gastric cancer cell proliferation and EMT process. Additionally, immunoblotting results indicated that Nrf2-related signaling including HO-1, NQO-1 and p-NF-κB protein expression levels were obviously reduced in SNU-5 and OCUM-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8A</ref>). To further study the potential role of Nrf2 in DHHC2-mediated gastric carcinoma progression, DHHC2 was then overexpressed in cells, and empty vector served as a control. The qPCR and western blotting results verified the alterations of Nrf2 mRNA levels in DHHC2-overexpressing tumor cell lines (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">8B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). Furthermore, we found that promoting Nrf2 stabilization not only accelerated cancer cell proliferation, but also significantly abrogated the anti-proliferative capacity of shDHHC2, as indicated by the restored cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8D</ref>). Similarly, DHHC2 overexpression enhanced SNU-5 and OCUM-1 cells migratory and invasive properties. Meanwhile, DHHC2 knockdown-reduced migration and invasion of tumor cells were strongly abrogated upon Nrf2 overexpression (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">8E-G</ref>). Similarly, N-cadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1 and MMP2 gene expression levels were increased in SNU-5 and OCUM-1 cells with Nrf2 overexpression, while E-cadherin was restrained. Importantly, DHHC2 knockdown-mediated expression of these genes was remarkably abrogated in these Nrf2-overexpressing cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8H</ref>). These results demonstrated that Nrf2 is required for DHHC2 targeting function in suppression of stomach cancer progression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.7.">Interruption of Nrf2 palmitoylation by 2-BP inhibits tumor growth in mice</head><p>Since depalmitoylation exhibited important effects on Nrf2 expression and nuclear translocation, we inquired whether suppression of DHHC2 or the 2-BP treatment, was capable of restraining tumor cell survival and tumor growth in mice model. In this regard, NCI-N87 and SNU-1 cells were incubated with 2-BP or Palm B. Indeed, suppression of palmitoylation via 2-BP largely reduced Nrf2 binding and increased Caspase-3 binding in tumor cells, while the binding of Nrf2 and Caspase-3 processes were reversed by inhibitor of depalmitoylase Palm B (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9A</ref>). Similar findings were also found in the apoptotic cell raction of SNU-1 and NCI-N87 cells and apoptosis-associated indicators including Bcl2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP expression during 2-BP or Palm B treatment (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">9B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). In addition, by knocking down DHHC2, overexpression of Nrf2 WT and corresponding Nrf2 C514S led to similar protein levels in apoptosis-related indicators. This suggested that DHHC2 primarily controlled C514, which was a significant site of Nrf2 palmitoylation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9D</ref>). To further evaluate the requirement of palmitoylation for Nrf2 function in vivo, the lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting DHHC2 was used to knockdown DHHC2 in mice bearing  <ref type="figure">E-G</ref>, Pearson multiple correlation analysis for human subjects (E, F), and parameter covariance: multiple linear regression analysis (G) for the indicated parameter indexes. H, Representative immunohistochemical images of DHHC2 expression in clinic tissue of human donors with gastric carcinoma (200 × , n = 20 samples). I, Representative immunofluorescence images of Nrf2 and DHHC2 coexpression in NCI-N87 cells with WT and DHHC2(KO) phenotype, and corresponding fluorescence density analysis J, NCI-N87 cells were incubated with DMSO and 2-BP, followed by immunofluorescence analysis using Nrf2 and DHHC2 antibodies (n = 5 samples per group; P &lt; 0.05 vs. DMSO). Scale bars, 50 μm. K, The NCI-N87 cells with Nrf2 WT or Nrf2 C514S mutant transfection were incubated with Nrf2 and DHHC2 antibodies, and fixed sections were then subjected to immunofluorescence analysis (n = 5 samples per group; P &lt; 0.05 vs. WT). Scale bars, 50 μm. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. The relevant experiments presented in this part were performed independently at least three times. Significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test analysis or 2-sided Student's t-test. The P value less than 0.05 was considered for significant difference. NCI-N87 cells-triggered tumorigenesis, and enclosed a rescue treatment with overexpression of Nrf2. As expected, mice with shDHHC2 treatment significantly retarded NCI-N87 tumor growth, while increase of Nrf2 expression largely rescued tumor growth (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">9E-G</ref>). These findings collectively revealed that targeting DHHC2mediated Nrf2 palmitoylation conferred protection against tumor growth in the NCI-N87 tumor model.</p><p>Given the pharmacological activity of 2-BP in the suppression of DHHC2-Nrf2-related tumor growth in vivo, we investigated various different concentration of 2-BP (0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg) in the NCI-N87 tumor model. Mice treated with the above-mentioned doses of 2-BP exhibited a dose-dependent pharmacological effect on inhibition of mice bearing NCI-N87 tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9H</ref>). Coincidentally, the increasing doses of 2-BP also markedly elevated the infiltration of CD8 + cells in tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9I-L</ref>). In addition, the NCI-N87 with Nrf2 deletion cell line was established. Then, similar to the above method the adenovirus-mediated overexpressing vectors targeting Nrf2 WT (AdNrf2 (WT)) and Nrf2 C514S (AdNrf2 (C514S)) were used in mice bearing NCI-N87 (Nrf2 -/-) cellstriggered tumorigenesis. The adenovirus-mediated empty vector was treated as a control (AdControl). As expected, consistent with our other findings, mice with AdNrf2 (C514S) treatment significantly retarded tumor growth, while an increase in AdNrf2 (WT) administration largely promoted tumor growth. Indeed, the Nrf2 with C514S mutant loses its ability to support oncogenesis in mouse model-bearing xenografts (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9M -P</ref>). These above results confirmed that C514 is a key site of Nrf2 palmitoylation and played a critical role in tumor growth in the NCI-N87 tumor model. Targeting DHHC3-mediated palmitoylation of Nrf2-promoted antitumor immunity in the tumor model and targeting Nrf2 palmitoylation by 2-BP can efficiently suppress Nrf2dependent immune evasion of tumor cells and tumor growth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.8.">Establishment and characterization of a novel biomimetic nanoreservoir delivery system</head><p>Given the anti-tumor effect of 2-BP on tumor cells proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo, we designed a novel biomimetic nanoreservoir delivery system based on gold nanorods (GNRs), which was packaged with a stomach cancer cell cytomembrane for cooperative cancer photothermal and chemotherapy (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref>). The GNRs with hyaluronic acid (HA) modification were used in this section as nanocarriers. The 2-BP was first added by electrostatic interaction, followed by incubation with OXA via a chelation reaction, and the GNPs were finally packaged into a stable OXA cross-linked 2-BP-loaded nanoreservoir (GNRs-BO). Subsequently, these nanoparticles were then coated with a cytomembrane harvested from NCI-N87 cells (CM@GNRs-BO), which was highly expressing CD74. Membrane proteins, especially CD74, play a key role in isotypic interactions between NCI-N87 cells. Due to the dual stabilizing effect of HA-modified nanocarriers and cancer cell cytomembrane, the delivery system significantly prolongates blood circulation and avoids premature release. The unique capacity of cytomembrane-coated nanoparticles to specifically target homologous cells, together with the synergistic effects of photothermal therapy and chemotherapy using gold nanorods and 2-BP-OXA, results in the outstanding efficacy of CM@GNRs-BO in vivo against cancers. The ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy exhibited two characteristic peaks including the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peak at 660 nm and transverse surface plasmon resonance peak at 510 nm, indicating the successful fabrication of rod-shaped nanocarriers (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>). Then, OXA was subjected to these nanoparticles as a physical crosslinker to form OXA and a 2-BP dual drug-loading GNRs (GNRs-BO) mixture based on the chelation of OXA with the side carboxyl groups from HA. The nanocarriers were finally packaged with cytomembrane vesicles (CM) isolated from stomach cancer cell line NCI-N87 via ultrasonication and physical co-extrusion (CM@GNRs-BO). The LSPR peak of the obtained nanoparticles was red-shifted to about 670 nm, probably due to the altered molecular conformation after packaging with cytomembrane or drugs. Of note, the characteristic peaks of 2-BP were detected in CM@GNRs-BO, suggesting the integrity of the designed dual drug-loading nanocarriers after physical co-extrusion (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>). The dual drug-packaging abundance and loading content of CM@GNRs-BO were 10.1 % and 52.8 % for 2-BP, and 4.7 % and 61.2 % for OXA, respectively.</p><p>Next, dynamic light scatterer (DLS) and zeta potential analysis were used to determine the size of GNR, GNRs-BO, CM@GNRs-BO and corresponding cytomembrane (CM) vesicles. In Fig. <ref type="figure">7C</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>, the prepared CM@GNRs-BO nanoparticles (93.5 ± 6.7 nm) displayed a larger particle size than those detected for pure GNRs (61.2 ± 3.3 nm), which indicated that the HA component of about 31 nm thickness was packaged into the GNRs. Also, after determination of structure, the photothermal properties were then examined with a real-time infrared thermal camera. The temperature of nanoparticles containing HA-GNRs, GNRs-BO, and CM@GNRs-BO significantly increased above 55 • C under laser irradiation for 500 s (808 nm, 1 W/cm 2 ) while the temperature of PBS only elevated about 3 • C (Fig. <ref type="figure">7E</ref>), suggesting that nanoparticles and cell membrane packaging did not influence the photostability. In addition, to evaluate the photostability, 4 cycles of 808 nm laser irradiation were delivered to CM@GNRs-BO nanoparticles, which all exhibited consistent and similar photothermal conversion (Fig. <ref type="figure">7E</ref>). Notably, the results further showed that the thickness of the nanocarriers was relatively close to the lifting size of GNRs-BO, indicating 2-BP, OXA, HA and GNRs were loaded into a consolidated system. The TEM images of CM@GNRs- BO also conferred visual data that a core (GNRs-BO)-shell (cytomembrane) structure was constructed with a cell membrane thickness of about 5 nm (Fig. <ref type="figure">7F-H</ref>). Treated cells with CM@GNRs-BO nanoparticles incorporated in vitro more nanoparticles than cells treated with GNR-or GNRs-BO in vitro experiments. Meanwhile, the markedly decreased cell viability could be attributed to CM@GNRs-BO uptaken by the different gastric cancer cell lines, as shown in Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">10A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.9.">Treatment with CM@GNRs-BO performs a synergistic photothermal and chemical therapy in suppression of gastric cancer cell growth</head><p>Considering the establishment of CM@GNRs-BO nanoparticles based on our above characterization data, this forced us to evaluate whether administration of CM@GNRs-BO could markedly suppress cancer cell survival and tumor growth in an animal model. Accordingly, the NCI-N87 and SNU-1 cells were treated with CM@GNRs-BO nanoparticles, followed by treatment with recombinant human DHHC2 and Caspase-3. In Fig. <ref type="figure">8A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>, Caspase-3 expression in both NCI-N87 and SNU-1 cells was significantly increased by CM@GNRs-BO nanoparticles administration, compared to the DMSO group. Inversely, NCI-N87 and SNU-1 cells treated with CM@GNRs-BO exhibited lower DHHC2 expression than those in DMSO-treated controls. Consistent results were also found in apoptotic cell raction of SNU-1 and NCI-N87 cells and apoptosis-associated indicators including Bcl2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP expression during CM@GNRs-BO treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure">8C</ref>). Given the pharmacological activity evaluation of CM@GNRs-BO in the suppression of stomach cancer cell survival, we examined the protection exerted by CM@GNRs-BO in the NCI-N87 tumor model. Mice treated with CM@GNRs-BO displayed a marked pharmacological effect on the tumor growth of mice bearing NCI-N87 tumor growth (Fig. <ref type="figure">8C-H</ref>). Consistently, the CM@GNRs-BO treatment also remarkably increased positive CD8 cell infiltration in tumor tissue with a significant reduction in Ki67-positive cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">8I</ref> and<ref type="figure">J</ref>), and decrease in mRNA levels of Nrf2 and downstream genes including HO-1, GCLC, NQO1, SOD and CAT expression (Fig. <ref type="figure">8K</ref>). These data suggested that CM@GNRs-BOtreated suppression of DHHC2-related palmitoylation was capable of inhibiting tumor growth.</p><p>Given the pharmacologic action of CM@GNRs-BO on the inhibition of stomach cancer progression, we further investigated the effects of CM@GNRs-BO on tumor cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. In agreement with the decreased Nrf2 expression during knockdown of DHHC2, the Nrf2 expression was markedly reduced in CM@GNRs-BOadministrated SNU-5 and OCUM-1 cells, as validated by the qPCR and immunoblotting assaya (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">11A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). The CCK-8 assay suggested that CM@GNRs-BO treatment significantly suppressed the proliferative capacity of gastric cancer cell lines compared with the control group (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">11C</ref>). The transwell detection indicated that CM@GNRs-BO significantly restrained the invasion and migration of tumor cells, compared to the corresponding controls (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">11D-G</ref>). Unsurprisingly, EMT-related markers including Vimentin, N-cadherin, ZEB1 and MMP2 were sharply reduced in SNU-5 and OCUM-1 cells (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">11H</ref> and<ref type="figure">I</ref>). Furthermore, in vivo experiments also demonstrated that CM@GNRs-BO intervention effectively decreased the tumor growth rates and tumor weights in the established mice bearing OCUM-1 (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure">11J</ref> and<ref type="figure">K</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>With the rapid development of early diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, particularly the application of targeted therapy, the overall survival rate of gastric carcinoma has improved. However, the prognosis of gastric carcinoma patients still remains poor due to the imperfect understanding of the pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma development. Although the proliferation and drug resistance processes of gastric cancer are known to strongly influence the prognosis of patients, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still not fully understood, leading to unsatisfactory treatment efficacy. Herein, investigating promising molecules and associated mechanisms of stomach cancer progression may aid the treatment outcomes of patients. Lately, a sequence of DHHCs (Zinc Finger DHHC-Type Palmitoyltransferases) members have received increasing attention owing to their special palmitoylationrelated enzymatic catalytic function <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. Our current study highlighted 4 of the most dramatically changed palmitoyltransferases (i.e., DHHC2, DHHC5, DHHC18 and DHHC23) in different models in vitro or in patients with stomach cancer phenotypes. Nrf2, although not an absolutely perfect hallmark for tumorigenesis, predisposes to tumor cell survival, drug resistance generation, and even tumor metastasis and proliferation, and was previously treated as an important influencing factor serving as metabolism and oxidative stress regulator in long-term mortality of patients with different tumor progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. In addition, we uncovered an important role of palmitoylation in governing the stabilization of the Nrf2 protein, which associated with the suppression of ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation of Nrf2. DHHC2 further exerts effects on stomach cancer progression by stabilizing Nrf2 and activating its downstream anti-antioxidant cascade signaling, thereby enhancing cancer cell survival, proliferation, and tumor growth. Of note, downregulated ROS contents by activation of Nrf2 signaling is the primary pathway for stomach cancer progression, however, the process of endogenous regulation of Nrf2 palmitoylation-associated signaling via blockers may be quite different.</p><p>This study extends and suggests candidates for possible pharmacological targets, conferring potential experimental evidence for stomach cancer treatment and drug development.</p><p>Increasing studies have identified that a series of clinical chemotherapeutic &amp; radiotherapeutic drugs (e.g., fluorouracil, cisplatin, Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.

Considering the complicated tumorigenesis and chemoresistance identified in progressive gastric cancer with metastasis, malignant ascites and tissue infiltration, a series of potential targeted drugs in clinical trials did not meet the expected requirements. Currently, Nrf2, a key transcription factor, exhibits a vital role in redox regulation challenge and control of the innate immune response and cell survival by promoting the antioxidant response <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. However, as a "double-faced' role in tumorigenesis regulation, a series of compounds that target Nrf2 to regulate gene expression and then act as a chemical prevention, including synthetic chemicals (i.e., Oltipraz) and some natural active products, such as curcumin, sulforaphane, resvertrol have been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. More importantly, recent studies have shown that the constitutive high activity of the Nrf2 signal pathway in diverse cancers remarkably increases the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, prevents apoptosis, enhances the self-renewal ability of cancer stem cells (CSC), thereby facilitating the chemical and radiation resistance of cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>. Therefore, blocking the endogenous Nrf2 signal via posttranslational modification is a promising cancer treatment strategy, especially for cancer with higher levels of Nrf2 levels. Indeed, among posttranslational modification forms, palmitoylation has been shown to modulate protein stabilization by blocking ubiquitination. In this regard, we confirmed for the first time that progression of stomach cancer could be promoted by increased Nrf2 abundance through upregulation of S-palmitoylation, accompanied by inhibition of Nrf2-related ubiquitin-proteasome degradation.</p><p>Zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 2 (DHHC2), a critical member of Zinc finger-aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine (DHHC)-CRD (cysteine rich domain)-type palmitoyl acyltransferases, is regarded as a "Janus-faced" factor involved in immune response, nervous diseases, metabolism, tumorigenesis and development by catalyzing palmitoylation modification of targeted proteins, leading to targeted substrates trafficking or translocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Previous report have indicated that DHHC2 was tightly correlated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and deletion of DHHC2 prompted cell migration via cooperating with miR-155, thereby promoting cell proliferation and tumor growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. Of note, DHHC2 was acted as fusion factor with LTBP1 in breast carcinoma, and with PPP2R2 A in ovarian cancer progression, contributing to the development of carcinogenesis. These findings collectively suggested that DHHC2 served as its distinct function in the progression of various tumor types. On top of being a marked promoter in a series of diseases, in our current work, we did provide a novel role of DHHC2 in stomach cancer development by targeting Nrf2 palmitoylation. DHHC2 promoted promotion of cell survival, proliferation and migration by increasing the levels of S-palmitoylation-stabilized Nrf2 along with decrease in proteasome degradation of Nrf2. The accelerated effects of DHHC2 on Nrf2 and its downstream signaling cascade are tightly depend on the DHHC domain activity. DHHC2 activity is positively correlated with Nrf2 abundance, upregulated hallmarks of stomach cancer (e.g., CA125, CEA, CA242, CA50, CA199 etc.) in both human subjects with gastric carcinoma phenotype and in cell lines. In line with these findings, mice bearing tumor model with DHHC2 knockdown exhibited decreased severity of tumor growth. Notably, we also determined that Nrf2 is a direct and novel interaction protein partner of DHHC2. DHHC2 accelerated Nrf2 expression by reducing its degradation via upregulating palmitoylation-stabilized Nrf2, followed by suppression of ubiquitination degradation of K48 linkage, further promoting Nrf2 signaling nuclear translocation and downstream events. Meanwhile, stomach cancer cells with high DHHC2 levels not only facilitated Nrf2-triggered antioxidant factor synthesis, but also lowered ROS levels, boosted DHHC2 expression, tumor cell proliferation, and tumor growth. This mechanism eventually results in a vicious cycle and positive feedback, which accelerates the spread of stomach cancer.</p><p>Additionally, DHHC2 displays its catalytic function at molecular levels, mainly depending on a specific DHHC domain. Evidence-based reports have indicated that the DHHC domain of DHHCs is evolutionary conserved and is required for interaction with potential targeted proteins. Actually in our work, DHHC-CRD domain of DHHC2 is required for interaction with Nrf2, while the C154 site of DHHC-CRD domain in DHHC2 is responsible for enzymatic activity and catalytic function. Furthermore, the importance of Nrf2-ECH homology (Neh1-Neh7) domain of Nrf2 for its binding to other partner factors has been widely determined. It was not clear, however, whether the Nrf2-ECH homology of Nrf2 region had other functions beyond the known forward trafficking for nuclear localization and co-binding signaling. Interestingly, cysteine 514 (C514) of human Nrf2 in Neh1 domain was predicted to be the most likely and reliable protein palmitoylation modification site by algorithm analysis. Indeed, in the presence of DHHC2, Nrf2 with C514S mutant lost its ability to interact with the DHHC2 protein, followed by decrease in Nrf2 nuclear translocation and Nrf2 downstream signaling, and increase in K48-linked ubiquitin proteasome degradation of Nrf2. These also revealed that the C514 of Nrf2 is necessary for DHHC2-induced palmitoylation. The mutation reduced the stability of Nrf2, and blocked the function of DHHC2 to use Nrf2 as the main catalytic substrate, ultimately leading to enhanced degradation of Nrf2Besides, as a well-characterized suppressor of protein S-palmitoylation, 2-BP has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in the mitigation of neuropathic pain and bone cancer pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. However, the role of 2-BP in inhibiting the development of stomach cancer remains unknown. Our results further uncover that 2-BP can be beneficial to the suppression of pathological symptoms of gastric tumor growth via cell proliferation and EMT process at appropriate doses, which also provides the possibility for the development of 2-BP as a drug with potential pharmacological efficacy in the treatment of stomach cancer via targeting palmitoylation.</p><p>In light of the molecular mechanism of DHHC2 in the progression of stomach cancer, a multi-combination of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy confers better anti-tumor results than monotherapeutic approaches. Thus, a novel anti-tumor drug delivery system based on 2-BP and oxaliplatin (OXA) dual-loading gold nanorods (GNRs) with tumor cell membrane-coating biomimetic nanoparticles (CM@GNRs-BO) was developed. In situ photothermal therapy was performed under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation to further mediate the on-demand release of high-temperature-triggered drugs from the CM@GNRs-BO reservoir to accomplish photothermal/chemical synergistic therapy. The antitumor mechanisms of this combination strategy are likely that (i) the efficacy of DHHC2-mediated palmitoylation is suppressed by 2-BP released from 2-BP-coated GNRs; (ii) OXA was added to the Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>.
