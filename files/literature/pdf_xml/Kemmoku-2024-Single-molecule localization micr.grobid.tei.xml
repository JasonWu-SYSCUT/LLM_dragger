<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is critical for the type I interferon response to pathogen-or self-derived DNA in the cytosol. STING may function as a scaffold to activate TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), but direct cellular evidence remains lacking. Here we show, using single-molecule imaging of STING with enhanced time resolutions down to 5 ms, that STING becomes clustered at the trans-Golgi network (about 20 STING molecules per cluster). The clustering requires STING palmitoylation and the Golgi lipid order defined by cholesterol. Single-molecule imaging of TBK1 reveals that STING clustering enhances the association with TBK1. We thus provide quantitative proof-of-principle for the signaling STING scaffold, reveal the mechanistic role of STING palmitoylation in the STING activation, and resolve the long-standing question of the requirement of STING translocation for triggering the innate immune signaling. The innate immune system is an evolutionary ancient system to fight against invading pathogens 1,2 . It acts as the first line of defense, detecting the virus and bacteria through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and activating intracellular signaling cascades that promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, type I interferons, and other antiviral proteins that all coordinate the elimination of pathogens and infected cells. PRRs include Toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors, and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> . Furthermore, STING (also known as MITA, ERIS, MPYS or TMEM173) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> has been shown to control a sensing pathway that is essential for the innate immune response against double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses. While the STINGmediated dsDNA-sensing signaling pathway is critical for successful protection against infections, dysregulated STING activity leads to the excessive production of inflammatory mediators with detrimental effects on surrounding cells and tissues 10 . Recent studies have revealed the critical role of STING in the pathogenesis of a number of autoinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, such as STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , COPA syndrome 13-18 , Parkinson's disease 19 , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</p></div>

The activation of TBK1 and IRF3 by STING requires the palmitoylation of STING on Cys88 and Cys91 and the Golgi lipid order <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , leading to the hypothesis that STING becomes clustered in the specific lipid microdomain at the TGN in palmitoylation-dependent manner and that the cluster facilitates the activation of TBK1 and IRF3 by recruiting multiple TBK1 and IRF3 molecules simultaneously onto it. In the present study, we examined whether STING formed the signalingcompetent homocluster at the TGN by photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) and direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cluster formation of STING at the TGN</head><p>To quantitatively analyze the STING cluster, we performed live-cell PALM observation of mEos4b-STING. First, we performed data acquisition using purified mEos4b embedded in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on glass at 33 ms/frame and quantified the blinking and photoactivation based on the kinetic model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). This is the calibration for the actual experiment that is described later. The distribution of fluorescence intensity of mEos4b could be fitted with a single lognormal function based on both Akaike and Bayesian information criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>), indicating that only the mEos4b monomer was observed. The measured probability distribution of the number of blinking times before photobleaching (N blink ) and the probability density function of T on were fitted with predicted geometric distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1d</ref>) or single exponential function (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1e</ref>), respectively, which allowed us to estimate &lt;N blink &gt; (=k d /k b ) to be 1.7.</p><p>The photo-switching behavior of mEos4b in PVA was similar to that in bacterial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that PVA matrix restricts oxygen accessibility and exerts redox effects, and the imperative necessity arises to validate the methodology. Therefore, to test if we could accurately estimate the number of molecules in clusters using &lt;N blink &gt; , we performed positive control observations. PC3 cells express caveolin but remain devoid of cavin1, thereby resulting in the absence of caveolae. A previous report <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> showed that the transfection of PC3 cells with cavin1 cDNA induced the formation of caveolae. Accordingly, we performed PALM observations of mEos4b-cavin1 in PC3 cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f</ref>, left and middle), taking advantage of the 100% labeling efficiency of cavin1 with mEos4b. The images were binarized (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1f</ref>, right) using a traditional method of kernel density estimation (KDE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , which is applicable to a wide range of objects of observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . By dividing the numbers of emission bursts of mEos4b in clusters with 1 + &lt;N blink &gt; for the unbiased multi-blinking correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> , the number of cavin1 molecules in each caveolae (hereafter, denoted as [#cavin1/caveolae]) was determined. The average of [#cavin1/caveolae] was estimated to be 52 ± 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>, left), which is close to the previously reported one (50 ± 5) measured by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Another segmentation method of the PALM images, SR-Tesseler <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> , which has been frequently used <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , gave essentially the similar results (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1g</ref>, right). These results unequivocally affirm the successful quantification of molecular counts in clusters using &lt;N blink &gt; of mEos4b in PVA.</p><p>mEos4b-STING was stably expressed with virus transduction in STING-knockout (KO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In these cells, the expression level of STING was comparable to that of endogenous STING in MEFs (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1a</ref>). mEos4b-STING activated TBK1 and IRF3 with less potency than wild-type (WT) STING. We stimulated the cells with DMXAA (a membrane-permeable STING agonist) for the indicated time and obtained live-cell PALM images (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1h-k</ref>). The number of STING molecules in each cluster (hereafter, denoted as [#STING/cluster]) was determined and we found that the average of [#STING/cluster] increased up to 360 min after stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>). The clusters consisting of &gt;800 STING molecules formed around 30-60 min after stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1k</ref>). SR-Tesseler also gave essentially the similar results (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>). Importantly, STING clusters were also observed after stimulation with HT-DNA transfection (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>).</p><p>The average of [#STING/cluster] estimated by performing the PALM data acquisitions at 5 ms/frame, was not significantly different from those at 33 ms/frame (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). We also corrected multi-blinking of mEos4b by the recently reported model-based correction (MBC) workflow, calibration-free estimation of blinking dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> , and found no significant difference between two methods of multiple-blinking correction (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</p><p>Phosphorylated TBK1 (p-TBK1) and phosphorylated STING (p-STING) emerged 30-60 min after stimulation in cells expressing mEos4b-STING (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>). Given that STING activates TBK1 at the TGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , not the other domains of the Golgi, these results suggested that mEos4b-STING reached the TGN by that time. To corroborate this, we performed simultaneous dual-color observation of PALM of mEos4b-STING and dSTORM of a cis-Golgi network (CGN) protein, GM130-HaloTag7, or a TGN protein, TGN38-HaloTag7 labeled with SaraFluor650B (SF650B) in living cells. As indicated by arrowheads (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2a</ref>), the mEos4b-STING clusters colocalized with GM130 10 min, not 30 min after stimulation. The quantitative coordinatebased colocalization (CBC) analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> showed that the localization coordinates of mEos4b-STING and GM130-HaloTag7-SF650B were distributed in higher CBC scores (0.7-1.0) more frequently than control 10 min after stimulation, but were reduced to the control level 30 min after stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). In contrast, the mEos4b-STING clusters became extensively colocalized with TGN38 30-60 min after stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2d-f</ref>). The colocalization of mEos4b-STING with TGN38 then decreased during 60-120 min after stimulation. It is of note that Spearman's correlation coefficients pertaining to the amounts of mEos4b-STING or TGN38-HaloTag7 and the CBC scores 60 min after stimulation consistently fell within the range of -0.3-0.3 across all instances (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). These results indicated that the colocalization of mEos4b-STING with TGN38-HaloTag7 was less affected by the expression level of mEos4b-STING or TGN38-HaloTag7.</p><p>After the exit of STING from the Golgi/TGN, STING translocates to recycling endosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . In line with this, colocalizations of mEos4b-STING with recycling endosomal proteins (transferrin receptor (TfnR) and Rab11) increased only 120-360 min after DMXAA stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a-f</ref>).</p><p>In sum, the PALM analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>) showed that STING became clustered at the TGN, with some clusters containing &gt;800 STING molecules (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1k</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Palmitoylation of STING is required for the cluster formation at the TGN</head><p>We previously demonstrated that STING palmitoylation, the posttranslational modification essential for the STING signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , facilitated the STING clustering to trigger the activation of TBK1 and IRF3. To prove this, we performed live-cell PALM observation of mEos4b-STING in the presence of palmitoylation inhibitors, 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) and a STING-specific palmitoylation inhibitor H-151 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The STING cluster colocalizes with cholesterol-enriched domains</head><p>The role of cholesterol in the STING signaling and clustering led us to examine the subcellular localization of cholesterol. To visualize cholesterol, we exploited a recently established cholesterol biosensor iD4H (derived from the Clostridium Perfringens theta-toxin) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> . Recombinant mNeonGreen-tagged iD4H bound to liposomes at which cholesterol exceeded 20% molar content (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). In the resting state, mRuby3-STING localized at the ER and did not colocalize with puncta positive with mNeonGreen-iD4H (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7i,</ref><ref type="figure">j</ref>). In contrast, after STING stimulation with DMXAA, mRuby3-STING, especially the one forming puncta at the Rab6 (a TGN protein)-positive area, partly colocalized with mNeonGreen-iD4H. We also noted the stimulation-dependent increase of the signal of mNeonGreen-iD4H at the Rab6-positive area (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7k</ref>).</p><p>The increased signal of mNeonGreen-iD4H did not colocalize with lipid droplets visualized by Lipi-Blue (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">11</ref>), suggesting that lipid droplet was not involved in the enhanced accumulation of mNeonGreen-iD4H at the TGN.</p><p>The treatment with OSW-1 suppressed the increase of mNeonGreen-iD4H at the Rab6-positive area (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>). The area of the Rab6-positive region was not affected with OSW-1 treatment (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10e</ref>). Intriguingly, palmitoylation inhibitors (2-BP and H-151) abolished the increase of the signal of mNeonGreen-iD4H at the Rab6-positive area (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7i-k</ref>). These results indicated the STING palmitoylation drove the local accumulation of cholesterol in the cytosolic leaflet of the TGN membranes.</p><p>We also examined the subcellular distribution of cholesterol by filipin, a polyene macrolide antibiotic. As shown (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">12</ref>), DMXAA stimulation did not increase the signal of filipin at the Rab6-positive area. Thus, the level of the cholesterol in the TGN membranes was not grossly affected by STING stimulation.</p><p>After STING stimulation, mNeonGreen-iD4H colocalized also well with TBK1-mScarletI (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10f</ref>). The treatment with OSW-1 partially suppressed the TBK1-positive puncta formation, which was also indicated by the remaining cytoplasmic signal of TBK1. The  colocalization of the TBK1-positive puncta with iD4H motivated us to examine the lipid order of the Golgi membranes. We observed that the TBK1-positive puncta showed a high value of the generalized polarization (GP) of di-4-ANEPPDHQ (movie S1). These results suggested that the membrane domains positive with TBK1 had high membrane rigidity or were highly ordered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The clustering of STING facilitates TBK1 recruitment</head><p>STING has long been assumed to act as a protein scaffold to recruit and activate TBK1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> . To directly examine if the clustering of STING facilitates TBK1 recruitment from the cytosol, simultaneous dual-color livecell PALM and single-molecule imaging were performed. We observed that single molecules of TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T molecules were transiently recruited to mEos4b-STING clusters after STING stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8a-c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1c</ref>, and movie S2). The lifetime of the colocalization durations of single-molecules of TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T with STING clusters was determined as around 150 ms in DMXAA-stimulated cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>). The result indicated that the large TBK1 clusters shown in Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">10f</ref> were formed by transient recruitment of TBK1 to STING clusters. Treatment of cells with H-151, which reduced the size of STING cluster (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c-f</ref>), significantly reduced it to 74 ms (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>By in vitro and in silico analyses, STING is suggested to oligomerize in the presence of cGAMP <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> , which may facilitate the activation of the STING signaling. However, these results do not explain the reason why TBK1/IRF3 activation occurs at the Golgi/TGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> , not at the ER where STING binds cGAMP. On the basis of the present cellular data by single-molecule localization microscopy, we propose a model underlying STING activation at the TGN (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8h</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13d</ref>): Binding of cGAMP to STING dimer induces conformational change and/or oligomerization of STING <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> , which allows STING to translocate from the ER to cis-Golgi network. STING further translocates to the TGN along the exocytic membrane flow, during which STING undergoes palmitoylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . At the TGN, STING clusters with the aid of the palmitoyl groups on Cys88 and Cys91 on STING (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>), cholesterol (a lipid directly transported from the ER to the TGN by lipid-transfer proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>), and sphingomyelin (a lipid synthesized at the TGN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). Palmitoylation of STING drove the local accumulation of cholesterol in the cytosolic leaflet of the TGN membranes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>), which may further facilitate STING clustering given the affinity of palmitoylated proteins and raft lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</p><p>By the analysis of the durations and frequencies of colocalization of TBK1 with STING (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>), we suggested that STING clustering facilitated TBK1 recruitment. The advantage of STING clustering in TBK1 recruitment may be explained as follows: Once TBK1 is detached from STING, there are other TBK1-free STING molecules around, in addition to the STING molecule that TBK1 originally binds to. Thus, STING clustering increases the encounter probability of TBK1 and STING. Clustering of STING may also be beneficial for TBK1 activation because two TBK1 dimers need to be placed close each other for autophosphorylation/autoactivation.</p><p>We noted that p-TBK1 was less affected in the conditions where the Golgi cholesterol was reduced (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). In contrast, p-TBK1 was severely reduced in the conditions where palmitoylation of STING was inhibited (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a,</ref><ref type="figure">b</ref>). We assume that orientation of individual STING molecules in the small STING cluster may differ in the two conditions. In cholesterol-depleted conditions, even a small STING cluster may accommodate two TBK1 dimers simultaneously, thus still facilitating autophosphorylation of TBK1. In contrast, a small cluster that palmitoylation-deficient STING forms may not accommodate two TBK1 dimers.</p><p>The TGN functions as the central hub for secretory cargo protein sorting and trafficking to the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> . A number of studies have established a cholesterol-and/or sphingolipid-based system for cargo sorting and membrane-carrier biogenesis at the TGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> . In the present study, we showed that a cholesterol-based system at the TGN operated also in triggering the innate immunity signaling. By exploiting a cholesterol biosensor and an environmentally sensitive probe for lipid membranes, we further demonstrated that cholesterol generated a specific membrane domain, or a liquid-ordered domain, in which palmitoylated STING formed clusters to activate TBK1 at the TGN. Our results provided direct evidence of the generation of liquid-ordered lipid microdomain in the TGN, which was originally postulated as "lipid raft" by Simons' group 26 years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . Our results also endorsed in vitro observations that palmitoylation of proteins increased the affinity to liquid-ordered phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</p><p>STING activates a wide array of innate immune and proinflammatory genes in addition to the type I interferons. However, the significance of the activation of these genes remains mostly elusive. One example is cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> , which metabolizes cholesterol to 25-HC <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> . Given the inhibitory effect of 25-HC on the STING signaling, the induction of CH25H in response to STING activation may contribute to the homeostasis of the STING signaling. Of note, knockdown of CH25H in B16 melanoma cells enhanced the STING signaling (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14</ref>), suggesting the causal link between the STING signaling and CH25H/25-HC.</p><p>H-151, a small-molecule inhibitor that suppresses STING palmitoylation on Cys91, has been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .

The purified mEos4b was diluted to 5 nM in a solution of 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, nacalai tesque) in HBSS (pH = 7.4). Then, 150 µl of the mEos4b solution was placed in a glass window of the glass base dish and was incubated for 1 h at room temperature to form a uniform thin layer. After washing with HBSS, 1 ml HBSS was added to the dish.</p><p>The blinking and photoactivation behaviors of mEos4b molecules were observed under the same laser illumination condition as that in cells. As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1b</ref>, we observed single mEos4b molecule emission trace, and measured the number of times mEos4b blinks &lt;N blink &gt; before a photobleaching event, the fluorescence-on time (T on ) before the molecule goes into the dark state or it photobleaches, the fluorescence-off time (T off ) or the time the molecule spends in the dark state as previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . The estimation of these parameters from the obtained images of mEos4b immobilized in PVA was performed by using the GDSC SMLM plugin of ImageJ (Time threshold was set to 2.5 s).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of images obtained by super-resolution microscopy</head><p>The detection of the fluorescent spots in the images was performed by using the ThunderSTORM plugin of ImageJ with "Wavelet filtering" (B-Spline order = 6 and B-Spline scale = 6.0) and the "Local maximum method" (Peak intensity threshold = 30-50 and Connectivity = 8neighborhood). After spot detection, the post-processing steps of "Remove duplications" (Distance threshold = uncertainty) and "Drift correction" (cross-correlation with 5 bins) were further performed. Several methods for PALM image segmentation have been proposed, but which method is the most appropriate is under debate and depends on characteristics of the objects of observation such as molecular density, cluster size, and the ratio of molecules in clusters to those in bulk phase, etc <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . For example, a pair-correlation method identifies molecular interactions inside clusters by analyzing distance correlation between localizations, but this method does not give us the number and position of clusters, and can be applied only to small clusters of relatively homogenous sizes. Density based spatial clustering analysis with noise (DBSCAN), which allows the classification of molecules in clusters, is known to be sensitive to background noise and difficult to parameterize experimentally. In the present study, we employed two kinds of ways for the image segmentation to detect mEos4b-STING clusters, kernel density estimation (KDE) and SR-Tesseler. In these methods, image segmentation is performed directly from the localization coordinates, which is applicable for the analysis of clusters of heterogenous size, and insensitive to background noise. Furthermore, these methods can be applicable to a wide range of the objects of observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . SR-Tessler 34 is one of the most frequently used methods for PALM image segmentation. Meanwhile, KDE <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> is a traditional image segmentation method and can rapidly determine the criterion for segmenting PLAM images as reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> and described below. KDE provides a way to interpolate object boundaries without bias by the random fluctuations of activated boundary fluorophores. In this study, the binarized PALM images of STING clusters were used for estimation of the residency time of single-molecules of TBK1-HaloTag7 inside the STING clusters upon stimulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8d,</ref><ref type="figure">e</ref>).</p><p>The datasets obtained by Thunderstorm were imported to the KDE software (MATLAB) for the cluster analysis and the image reconstruction. We used not only localization coordinates, but also uncertainty outputted by Thunderstorm, which represents the degree of spatial precision of the spot. Let x i ,y i , and u i ,i = 1,2, Á Á Á ,N be the horizontal and vertical localization coordinates and uncertainty of spot i, respectively. N represents the total number of spots. Considering the uncertainty of the location measurement of spot i, it is considered that the existence probability p i x,y ð Þ of the spot i spreads to the Gaussian distribution with the center coordinate x i ,y i and the standard deviation (S.D.) that is proportional to the uncertainty u i as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p i x,y ð Þ= 1 2πðAu i Þ 2 e À ðxÀx i Þ 2 + ðyÀy i Þ 2 2ðAu i Þ 2<label>ð2Þ</label></formula><p>in which, A is the proportional coefficient of S.D. to the uncertainty u i ; that is estimated as A≈6 by some preliminary experiments. Gaussian distribution constructing each existence probability p i x,y ð Þ is called Gaussian kernel. The existence probability distribution for all spots, i.e., the PALM image is obtained by the average of the existence probability distribution p i x,y ð Þ as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">p x,y ð Þ= 1 N X N i = 1 p i x,y ð Þ<label>ð3Þ</label></formula><p>excluding spots having extremely small or large uncertainty u i because such spots are likely to be noise. It can be considered that clusters exist where the PALM image, which represents the cluster existence probability distribution, takes above a certain threshold value θ because the spots appear uniformly inside the clusters with a certain probability. It is necessary to appropriately determine the optimal threshold value θ for each obtained PALM image because the optimal value differs depending on the target molecule and the experimental environments. In general, the histogram of pðx,yÞ values for all x,y forms a bimodal shape consisting of both larger values created by dense spots appeared in clusters and smaller values created by sporadic noise. Therefore, the threshold value θ should be determined so as to separate these two clusters. Otsu's method is well known as a method for determining such a threshold value <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> . Let S in and S out be sets of coordinates ðx,yÞ where pðx,yÞ ≥ θ and p x,y ð Þ&lt;θ, respectively. The sets S in and S out mean the inside and outside of clusters, respectively. The number of elements of the sets S in and S out are respectively represented by N in and N out .

Cluster contour detection was performed by using a Voronoi polygon density factor of 2 without correction of blinking and multi-ON frame detections by the"Detection cleaner" function (within the whole ROI).</p><p>Multiple blinking effects were corrected by two methods. One of them is the most commonly used method to merge events that appear close in space and time which is referred to as dark-time thresholding (DTT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . To estimate the numbers of mEos4b-STING in clusters, the numbers of localizations in clusters obtained by the KDE or SR-Tesseler method were divided by 1 + &lt;N blink &gt; , which is the number of localizations per one mEos4b molecule (2.7 for observation at 33 ms/ frame and 2.9 for observation at 5 ms/frame observation). The previous study demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> that this method accomplishes unbiased counting of molecules in clusters.</p><p>DTT has been most commonly used for the correction of multiple-blinking, but we need to assume that the blinking behaviors of isolated mEos4b are maintained also in cells. Therefore, to validate the STING numbers per cluster, we also corrected multiple-blinking artifacts by another method, using the PALM dataset and the parameters of a realistic model of fluorescent protein photophysics, which was recently reported and referred to as model-based correction (MBC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . MBC requires neither user input nor additional calibration data.</p><p>Using two methods of PALM image segmentation (KDE and SR-Tesseler) and two methods of multiple-blinking correction (division by 1 + &lt;N blink &gt; and MBC), we estimated averaged numbers of mEos4b-STING in clusters by three ways. Namely, we performed PALM image segmentation and multiple-blinking correction in the following three ways; (1) The number of localizations segmented by KDE was divided by 1 + &lt;N blink &gt; , (2) The number of localizations segmented by SR-Tesseller was divided by 1 + &lt;N blink &gt; , (3) mEos4b-STING spots corrected by MBC was segmented by SR-Tessler.</p><p>Simultaneous dual-color observation of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING and dSTORM of GM130-HaloTag7, TGN38-Halo-Tag7, TfnR-HaloTag7 or HaloTag7-Rab11 and coordinate-based colocalization analysis of PALM and dSTORM data Simultaneous data acquisitions of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING and dSTORM of GM130-HaloTag7 (a CGN protein), TGN38-HaloTag7 (a TGN protein), TfnR-HaloTag7 (an endosome protein) or HaloTag7-Rab11 (an endosome protein) were performed at 5 ms resolution and at 37 °C. The data acquisition of PALM of mEos4b-STING was performed as described in the method section of "Data acquisition of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING". For live-cell dSTORM of GM130-HaloTag7, TGN38-HaloTag7, TfnR-HaloTag7 or HaloTag7-Rab11, these molecules expressed in cells and labeled with SaraFluor650B (SF650B) were illuminated with the oblique-angle illumination mode using an excitation laser (647 nm, approximately 16 µW/µm 2 ). In the excitation arm, a multiple-band mirror (ZT405/488/561/647rpc, Chroma) was employed. The two-color fluorescence images of mEos4b and SF650B were separated into the two detection arms of the microscope by a dichroic mirror (Chroma: ZT561rdc-xr-UF2 or ZT647rdc-UF2). The detection arms were equipped with band-pass filters of FF01-600/37-25 (Semrock) or ET700/75 (Chroma), and the data acquisitions of PALM/dSTROM were performed at 5 ms/frame with an image size of 512 × 512 pixels, using two high-speed gate image intensifiers (C9016-02MLG; Hamamatsu Photonics) coupled to two sCMOS cameras (OCRA-Flash4.0 V2; Hamamatsu Photonics). The superimposition of images in different colors obtained by two separate cameras was performed as reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> .</p><p>To quantitatively analyze the degree of colocalization between mEos4b-STING and GM130-HaloTag7-SF650B, TGN38-HaloTag7-SF650B, TfnR-HaloTag7-SF650B, or SF650B-HaloTag7-Rab11, we performed coordinate-based colocalization (CBC) analysis of PLAM and dSTORM data according to ref. 36. with modification. Briefly, to estimate CBC values, for each molecule of protein A, the number of localizations of protein A (mEos4b-STING) and protein B (GM130-HaloTag7-SF650B, TGN38-HaloTag7-SF650B, TfnR-HaloTag7-SF650B, or SF650B-HaloTag7-Rab11) within circles of the increasing radius was calculated, respectively, providing the density gradients of localizations of protein A and protein B around this molecule.</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">D Ai,A ðrÞ = N Ai,A<label>ðrÞ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">πr 2 × πR 2 max N Ai,A ðR max Þ = N Ai,A ðrÞ N Ai,A ðR max Þ × R 2 max r 2<label>ð8Þ</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_9">D Ai,B ðrÞ = N Ai,B ðrÞ N Ai,B ðR max Þ × R 2 max r 2<label>ð9Þ</label></formula><p>Here, N Ai,A (r) is the number of localization of protein A within the distance r around protein Ai, and N Ai,B (r) is the number of localization of protein B within the distance r around Ai.

R max and dR (the bin of radius for analysis) were set at 500 nm and 50 nm, respectively, and if both the number of localizations of protein A and that of protein B were less than 50 (= R max dR × 5) in a circle with R max , CBC values were not calculated because the density gradients cannot be accurately calculated. A uniform distribution gives an expected value of D(r) = 1 for all r.</p><p>The two distributions were compared by calculating a rank correlation coefficient (Spearman), in which the colocalization coefficient was weighted by a value proportional to the distance to the nearest neighbor to avoid long-distance effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> .

The summation of C Ai and C Bi in the bins between 0.7 and 1 was used as an index for the colocalization. For control analysis, dSTORM images of GM130-HaloTag7-SF650B, TGN38-HaloTag7-SF650B, TfnR-HaloTag7-SF650B, or SF650B-HaloTag7-Rab11 were rotated by 180°and overlapped with PALM images of mEos4b-STING and the CBC scores were estimated.</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">S Ai = P R max r j = 0 ðO D Ai,A ðr j Þ À O D Ai,A ÞðO D Ai,B ðr j Þ À O D Ai,B Þ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi P R max r j = 0 ðO D Ai,A ðr j Þ À O D Ai,A 2 Þ r ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi P R max r j = 0 ðO D Ai,B ðr j Þ À O D Ai,B Þ 2 r<label>ð10Þ</label></formula><p>Simultaneous live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING, to visualize STING clusters and single-molecule imaging of TBK1-HaloTag7, to track their recruitment to STING clusters, and estimation of the residency lifetimes of TBK1-HaloTag7 inside the STING cluster</p><p>Simultaneous data acquisitions of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING and single-molecule tracking of TBK1-HaloTag7 labeled with Sara-Fluor650T (SF650T) were performed at 37 °C. The data acquisition of PALM of mEos4b-STING was performed as described in the method section of "Data acquisition of live-cell PALM of mEos4b-STING". Single-molecules of SF650T bound to TBK1-HaloTag7 were illuminated with the oblique-angle illumination mode using a 647 nm laser at 2.0 µW/µm 2 . The two-color fluorescence images of mEos4b and SF650T were recorded at 33 ms/frame. Under the conditions, the photobleaching lifetimes for SF650T was 7.3 ± 0.1 s.</p><p>Each individual fluorescent spot in the image was identified and tracked as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> . The superimposition of images in different colors obtained by two separate cameras was performed as reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> . The PALM image segmentation of mEos4b-STING was performed by KDE and the boundaries of STING clusters were determined by binarizing the STING cluster image as described in the section of "Analysis of images obtained by super-resolution microscopy". After binarization, the coordinates of the pixels located at the edges of the STING clusters were defined as the boundary. We measured the periods of trajectories of TBK1-HaloTag7 labeled with SF650T inside the boundary of STING clusters, and estimated the residency lifetimes by fitting the histograms with a single-exponential decay function. For control analysis to measure the lifetimes of nonspecific colocalization, PALM images of mEos4b-STING after DMXAA stimulation were superimposed with images of single-molecules of TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T before the stimulation.</p><p>To quantitatively evaluate STING densities in the cluster at which TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T molecules were recruited, we estimated the numbers of mEos4b-STING molecules within 100 nm radius around all the recruited TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T spots for all the frames. For control analysis, we generated the pseudo-trajectories by shifting the trajectories of TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T in random directions by random distances. In PALM image, let x(t) and y(t) be the x and y coordinates in the PALM image is defined as x = 1, 2, •••, N x and y = 1, 2, •••, N y , respectively. We generated two random natural numbers x 0 and y 0 , both less than or equal to N x and N y , respectively, then use x(t)x(0) + x 0 and y(t) -y(0) + y 0 as the trajectories of the control. In case that any part of the trajectories exceeds the range of x and y coordinates in the PALM image, we regenerate the random numbers and start over the process. Then, we estimated the numbers of mEos4b-STING molecules within 100 nm around the same numbers of randomized TBK1-HaloTag7-SF650T spots in silico. Subsequently, we created the histograms of the difference between the numbers of STING molecules around the observed TBK1 spots and the randomized spots in silico, which was normalized by periods and areas of the observations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8f</ref>, bottom). The reason for choosing 100 nm as the distance around the recruited TBK1 molecules to quantify the number of STING molecules is that shorter distances make analysis more difficult. For example, if we employ 50 nm as the distance, the area the number of STING molecules become one forth and the bars in the histogram of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8f</ref> fluctuate very much and the negative values often appear. It becomes hard to perform the same analysis shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8f</ref>.</p></div>
