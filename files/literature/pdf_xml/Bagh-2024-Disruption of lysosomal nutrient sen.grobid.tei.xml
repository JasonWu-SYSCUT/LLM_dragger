<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal 1 (CLN1) disease, formerly called infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, is a fatal hereditary neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder. This disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the CLN1 gene, encoding palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1). PPT1 catalyzes depalmitoylation of S-palmitoylated proteins for degradation and clearance by lysosomal hydrolases. Numerous proteins, especially in the brain, require dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycles) for endosomal trafficking to their destination. While 23 palmitoylacyl transferases in the mammalian genome catalyze S-palmitoylation, depalmitoylation is catalyzed by thioesterases such as PPT1. Despite these discoveries, the pathogenic mechanism of CLN1 disease has remained elusive. Here, we report that in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice, which mimic CLN1 disease, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1) kinase is hyperactivated. The activation of mTORC1 by nutrients requires its anchorage to lysosomal limiting membrane by Rag GTPases and Ragulator complex. These proteins form the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold to which mTORC1 must attach to activate. We found that in Cln1 -/-mice, two constituent proteins of the Ragulator complex (vacuolar (H + )-ATPase and Lamtor1) require dynamic S-palmitoylation for endosomal trafficking to the lysosomal limiting membrane. Intriguingly, Ppt1 deficiency in Cln1 -/-mice misrouted these proteins to the plasma membrane disrupting the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold. Despite this defect, mTORC1 was hyperactivated via the IGF1/PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway, which suppressed autophagy contributing to neuropathology. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K/Akt suppressed mTORC1 activation, restored autophagy, and ameliorated neurodegeneration in Cln1 -/-mice. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role of Cln1/Ppt1 in regulating mTORC1 activation and suggest that IGF1/PI3K/Akt may be a targetable pathway for CLN1 disease.</p><p>Dysregulated signaling pathway of the mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase has been linked to the development of human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.

Mutations in at least 14 different genes ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal(CLN1-CLN14) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> underlie various forms of NCLs. The CLN1 disease, formerly called infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>, is a devastating neurodegenerative LSD, caused by inactivating mutations in the CLN1 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. Despite this discovery, the mechanism of pathogenesis underlying CLN1 disease has remained elusive for more than 2 decades. Children with CLN1 disease are phenotypically normal at birth, but by 6 to 18 months of age they manifest psychomotor retardation. Around 2 years of age, these children are completely blind due to retinal degeneration and develop frequent seizures. MRI of the brain shows marked cortical atrophy. At around 4 years of age, an isoelectric EEG attests to a vegetative state. They remain in this condition for several more years before eventual death <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>. These grim facts underscore an urgent need for understanding the mechanism of pathogenesis of CLN1 disease, which may facilitate the development of curative therapies.</p><p>The CLN1 gene encodes palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> which catalyzes the removal of palmitate from S-palmitoylated proteins (constituents of ceroid lipofuscin) preventing their accumulation in lysosomes. Although PPT1 was originally reported to be localized in the lysosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>, recently, extra lysosomal presence of catalytically active PPT1 has been clearly demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>. Numerous proteins in the brain undergo S-palmitoylation (also called S-acylation), a posttranslational modification in which a saturated fatty acid (generally palmitate) is attached to specific cysteine residues in polypeptides via thioester linkage <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. S-palmitoylation confers hydrophobicity to proteins, increasing their membrane-affinity and promoting protein-protein interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. Dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref> facilitates endosomal trafficking of many proteins for their trafficking to the appropriate cellular destinations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. While S-palmitoylation is catalyzed by 23 palmitoyl acyltransferases (called ZDHHC-PATs or simply ZDHHCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>, depalmitoylation is mediated by thioesterases <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Recently, in a detailed unbiased proteomics study &gt;100 novel proteins, suggested to be PPT1 substrates, have been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Although the physiological functions of these proteins in the context of CLN1 disease remain largely unclear, the loss-of function mutations of the Cln1 gene may disrupt the functions of at least some of those genes and activate various pathways of mTORC1 activation contributing to pathogenesis.</p><p>The lysosome has been suggested to play critical roles in multiple cellular functions, including signaling in response to environmental cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. Emerging evidence has remarkably transformed our understanding of the lysosome from a terminal degradative organelle to a critical signaling hub for fundamental metabolic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Sensing essential nutrients is an important function of the lysosome to coordinate cellular metabolism and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. Signals from nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, and cholesterol are integrated by the lysosome, turning the cellular events from anabolic to catabolic processes like autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>. Whereas materials from extracellular sources are transported to the lysosome via endocytosis, those originating from intracellular sources are delivered by autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. Notably, activation of the mTORC1, situated at the crossroads of nutrient signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, suppresses autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. The loss of autophagy in the central nervous system has been reported to cause neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. There are three types of autophagy: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy in all of which the lysosome plays a pivotal role in degrading the cargo contained in the autophagosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Indeed, dysregulation of autophagy has been implicated not only in the pathogenesis of common neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref> but also in most LSDs in which neurodegeneration is a devastating manifestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>.</p><p>In the present study, we used tissues from the cerebral cortex of the brain of Cln1 -/-mice (40), a reliable animal model of CLN1 disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. Cortical tissues were used because in a previous clinical study (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT00028262), MRI of the brain of children affected with CLN1 disease showed a rapid degeneration of the cerebral cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Since CLN1/PPT1 is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues and cells, we also used cultured cells from INCL patients to determine whether the loss of Cln1/Ppt1 causes aberrant activation of the mTORC1 kinase and suppresses autophagy contributing to pathogenesis of CLN1 disease.</p></div>

Autophagy plays an essential role for neuronal survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Moreover, suppression of autophagy by activated mTORC1 underlies neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. Thus, we first sought to determine whether the level of activated mTORC1 in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice is higher than that in their WT littermates. Accordingly, we measured the levels of phosphorylated 70/S6 kinase-1 (pS6K1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (p4E-BP1), which are the canonical substrates of mTORC1 kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>. The results of Western blot analyses of total lysates of cortical tissues from Cln1 -/-mice revealed that the levels of both pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 were significantly higher than those in their WT littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). Since the Cln1/Ppt1 gene is expressed in all cells and tissues in mice and in humans, we also determined the levels of pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 in cultured lymphoblasts from patients with CLN1 disease and those from age-and sex-matched normal subjects. The results showed that the levels of pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 in cultured lymphoblasts from patients with CLN1 disease were substantially higher than those in their normal counterparts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the activation of mTORC1 signaling is significantly higher in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice, as well as in cultured lymphoblasts from patients with CLN1 disease.</p><p>Activation of mTORC1 signaling in developing and adult brain of WT and Cln1 -/-mice During their lifetime, all organisms encounter some environmental stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>. To cope with these stresses, most organisms have evolved survival mechanisms. In all placental mammals, a stressful event occurs during parturition when the transplacental nutrient supply is abruptly disrupted for a brief period. To cope with this brief but critical period of starvation, the neonates have evolved autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52)</ref> for the supply of nutrients. Several studies have demonstrated that mTORC1 senses and responds to cellular nutrient status via Rag family of GTPases <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(55)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>. The importance of lysosomal nutrient sensing in mammalian physiology has been elegantly demonstrated using a knockin mouse model that expressed a constitutively active form of Rag A (Rag A GTP ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. The results of this study showed that although the Rag A GTP/GTP mice were normal during in utero development, these pups succumb to death on postnatal day 1 (P1).</p><p>Since the activation of mTORC1 signaling suppresses autophagy and dysregulation of autophagy underlies neurodegeneration in most LSDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref> the levels of pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 in cortical tissues from WT and Cln1 -/-fetuses on gestational days 17 (G17) and 18 (G18). We chose these two dates because previously we found that the expression of Cln1/Ppt1 gene is detectable from as early as the 17th-18th day of gestation in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57)</ref>. Our results showed that there were no significant differences in the level of pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 in the brain of G17 and G18 fetuses from WT and Cln1 -/-mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>). Remarkably, compared with WT pups the levels of these markers of mTORC1 activation in the brain of Cln1 -/-pups were consistently higher from P1, which persisted throughout adulthood (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>). These results suggested that although during prenatal development, there were no significant differences in mTORC1 signaling between WT and Cln1 -/-pups, it was substantially increased in those of P1-Cln1 -/-pups and persisted throughout adulthood.</p><p>Hyperactivation of mTORC1 suppresses autophagy in Cln1 -/- mouse brain Lysosomes degrade endocytosed material from both extracellular sources as well as dysfunctional intracellular macromolecules and organelles accumulated in autophagosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37)</ref>. For this reason, the LSDs have been called the disorders of dysregulated autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Indeed, dysfunctional autophagy underlies virtually all neurodegenerative LSDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>. One of the roles mTORC1 activation is to maintain nutrient homeostasis through lysosomal biogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. The activation of mTORC1 signaling also inhibits the recycling of damaged organelles and aged macromolecules via autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Emerging evidence indicates that mTORC1 and autophagy are closely integrated processes. Moreover, dysregulated mTORC1 signaling may lead to a range of human ailments like cancer, neurodevelopmental, and neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58)</ref>. The activation of mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy by phosphorylating several autophagy-related proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>. Phosphorylation of some of these proteins like ULK and ATG-13 by mTORC1 results in inhibition of the ULK complex, thereby, preventing the initiation of autophagy. Further, the VPS34 complex plays a critical role in the induction of autophagy and vesicle trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>. The mTORC1 also regulates autophagy by phosphorylating ATG14L in the VPS34 complex to inhibit it. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the activation of mTORC1 signaling in Cln1 -/-mice inhibited autophagy by phosphorylating the autophagy-related proteins. Our results showed that compared with WT controls, the phosphorylation of ATG13 of the ULK complex was significantly higher in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). The level of phospho-ATG14 of the VPS34 complex, however, was not significantly higher in Cln1 -/-mice compared with that of the WT controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>). We also measured the levels of autophagy markers, LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1, to evaluate the status of autophagy in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice. The levels of both LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 were significantly higher in Cln1 -/- mice than those in their WT littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>). Taken together, these results suggested that in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice aberrant hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling dysregulated autophagy most likely contributing to neuropathology in this CLN1 disease model.</p><p>Genetic loss of Cln1/Ppt1 disrupts lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold in Cln1 -/-mice Emerging evidence indicates that sensing of essential nutrients is an important function of the lysosome <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60)</ref>. The lysosome integrates nutrient and metabolic cues to control cellular functions via mTORC1 signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>. Signals from nutrients regulate the activation of mTORC1 through the Rag GTPases. The Rag GTPases are obligate heterodimers of Rag A or Rag B complexed with Rag C or Rag D. The Ragulator complex (composed of Lamtor 1-5), vacuolar (H + )-ATPase (vATPase), and SLC38A9 on the lysosomal limiting membrane, which constitute the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. The mTORC1 must attach to the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold on lysosomal membrane (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>) to manifest its kinase activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61)</ref>. The acidic pH of the lysosomal lumen facilitates the degradation and clearance of cargo delivered to it from intracellular and extracellular sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(62)</ref>. The acidification of the lysosomal lumen is achieved primarily by the action of vATPase (63), a large multisubunit protein localized to the lysosomal membrane. The vATPase is also an important component of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65)</ref> as it catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP, which is essential for the vATPase-Ragulator interaction by nutrients such as amino acids. The lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold also facilitates the translocation of mTORC1 from the cytosol to the lysosomal membrane where it undergoes activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>.</p><p>Previously, we reported that a critical subunit of vATPase, V0a1, required dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylationdepalmitoylation) for endocytic trafficking to the lysosomal membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>. Intriguingly, we also found that in Ppt1deficient Cln1 -/-mice, V0a1 was misrouted to the plasma membrane instead of its normal location on lysosomal membrane, which dysregulated lysosomal acidification <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>. Therefore, we sought to determine whether other constituent proteins of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold such as the Rag-GTPases and the Ragulator complex also require dynamic S-palmitoylation and are misrouted to the plasma membrane in Cln1 -/-mice. Accordingly, we first determined the mRNA and protein levels of the Rag-GTPases and the Ragulator complex proteins in cortical tissues from WT and Cln1 -/- mice. We found that the mRNA levels of Rag A and Rag B in Cln1 -/-mouse brain were significantly higher than those in their WT littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2A</ref>). However, the protein levels of all the Rag-GTPases in total cortical lysates from WT and Cln1 -/-mice were virtually identical (Fig. <ref type="figure">2, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>). Remarkably, the purified lysosomal fractions from cortical tissues of Cln1 -/-mice contained significantly lower levels of Rag-GTPases (Fig. <ref type="figure">2D</ref>). Most notably, while the mRNA and protein levels of some of the Ragulator complex proteins were substantially higher in total cortical lysates from Cln1 -/-mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2B</ref> and<ref type="figure">E</ref>), those in the purified lysosomal fractions were significantly lower (Fig. <ref type="figure">2F</ref>). Intriguingly, SLC38A9, a component of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68)</ref>, also failed to localize on lysosomal membrane of Cln1 -/-mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">2, G</ref> and<ref type="figure">H</ref>). These results suggested that the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold in Cln1 -/-mice may be disrupted. This may be because one of the constituent proteins requiring S-palmitoylation (i.e., vATPase) is misrouted to the plasma membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>.

The p18/Lamtor1 plays critical roles in organizing the Ragulator-Rag GTPase complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>, essential for the assembly of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold and for nutrient-dependent activation of mTORC1 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61)</ref>. We reasoned that Lamtor1, like V0a1, may also require S-palmitoylation for trafficking to the lysosomal membrane and Ppt1 deficiency in Cln1 -/-mice may misroute it, thereby, disrupting the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold.</p><p>Previously, in a low-throughput proteomic study, Lamtor1 was predicted to be S-palmitoylated <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>. This prediction was confirmed by acyl biotin exchange assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref>, although the specific S-palmitoylated cysteine residue(s) in Lamtor1 was not identified. To identify the specific cysteine residue(s) that may be S-palmitoylated, we first analyzed the peptide sequence of Lamtor1 using CSS-Palm ( <ref type="formula">73</ref>), a computer program, which predicts the specific cysteine residues in polypeptides that are likely to be S-palmitoylated. The results of this analysis identified Cys3 and Cys4 in Lamtor1 from both humans and mice as potential S-palmitoylation sites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3A</ref>). Notably, these Cys residues in Lamtor1 are also evolutionarily conserved (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3B</ref>). To confirm whether Cys3 and Cys4 are indeed the S-palmitoylated residues, we transfected HEK293T cells with complementary deoxy ribonucleic acid constructs of Myc-tagged WT-and mutant-Lamtor1 (Cys3Ala, Cys4Ala, or Cys3Ala + Cys4Ala). We then analyzed the proteins for S-palmitoylation using acyl Rac assay <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(74)</ref>. We used Cys to Ala mutations because Ala does not undergo S-palmitoylation. We found that Cys3Ala or Cys4Ala mutants alone only partially reduced the level of S-palmitoylation. However, Cys3Ala and Cys4Ala mutations in the same construct completely abolished S-palmitoylation of Lamtor 1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3C</ref>). These results confirmed that both Cys3 and Cys4 are the S-palmitoylation sites in Lamtor 1. Notably, the level of S-palmitoylated Lamtor1 in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice was significantly higher than that in their WT littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3D</ref>). The reason behind this result is unclear. We also analyzed the peptide sequence of SLC38A9 using CSS-Palm and performed acyl Rac assay using native SLC38A9 protein from mouse brain lysate. The results showed that SLC38A9 does not undergo S-palmitoylation despite the prediction by CSS-Palm analysis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3, A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to confirm the lysosomal localization of Lamtor1 using confocal imaging of cultured cortical neurons from WT and Cln1 -/-mice. We found that in neurons from Cln1 -/-mice, there was a substantially reduced colocalization of Lamtor1 with the lysosomal membrane marker, Lamp2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3E</ref>). We also found that the level of Lamtor1 in enriched plasma membrane fractions of brain tissues from Cln1 -/-mice was significantly higher than that of their WT littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3F</ref>). Taken together, these results raised the possibility that like V0a1 subunit of vATPase <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>, Lamtor1 in neurons from Cln1 -/-mice may also be misrouted to the plasma membrane. Therefore, at least two of the most important constituent proteins in the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold (i.e., vATPase and Lamtor1), which require S-palmitoylation for trafficking to the lysosomal surface, were misrouted to the plasma membrane in Cln1 -/-mice. Cumulatively, these findings suggested that most likely the organization of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold is disrupted in Cln1 -/-mice but the pathway underlying aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling remained unclear. Thus, we sought to identify alternative pathways that may mediate aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling in the brain of this mouse model of CLN1 disease.</p><p>Growth factor-mediated pathway underlies mTORC1 activation in Cln1 -/-mice The lysosomal degradative function and the activation of mTORC1 signaling are highly coordinated processes. Whereas signals from nutrients within the cell facilitate the translocation of mTORC1 from the cytoplasm to the lysosomal membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>, those from growth factors can mediate mTORC1 activation via PI3K/Akt pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76)</ref>. Moreover, genetic studies in mice and humans have also revealed the important physiological functions of the PI3K/Akt network in virtually all organ systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(77)</ref>. Dysfunction of this network underlies diverse pathological conditions, including developmental abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases, insulin-resistance in type 2 diabetes, inflammatory, and neurological disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>. One potential pathway that may mediate aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling in Cln1 -/-mouse brain may involve tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes. Indeed, the knockdown of TSC2 gene in fetal tubers and in mouse neuroprogenitor cells has been reported to cause aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>. The TSC is an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder, caused by mutations in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(79)</ref>. It has also been reported that mTOR signaling plays a pivotal regulatory role during the development of cerebral cortex in mammals including humans. Consistent with this finding, rapid degeneration of neurons in the cerebral cortex of patients with CLN1 disease (16) has been observed. Moreover, the loss of function mutations of TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, and STRADα genes mediate mTORC1 activation, which causes epilepsy and neurobehavioral problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(80,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81)</ref>. Furthermore, suppression of mTORC1 activation has been reported to ameliorate seizure activity in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82)</ref>, which is a common manifestation in CLN1 disease.</p><p>A complex interplay between TSC2 and PI3K/Akt have also been reported to cause hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(83)</ref>. Accordingly, we investigated the growth factor-mediated pathway of mTORC1 signaling via PI3K/Akt, which phosphorylates TSC2 activating the small GTPase, Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4A</ref>). Notably, phosphorylation of TSC2 by PI3K/Akt promotes the activation of Rheb to the lysosomal membrane, thereby, activating mTORC1 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(84)</ref>. We reasoned that aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling in Cln1 -/-mouse brain may be mediated via TSC1-TSC2/Rheb pathway despite the disruption of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold. To test this hypothesis, we determined the levels of TSC complex consisting of TSC1, TSC2, and TBCD17 in the brain of WT and Cln1 -/-mice. The results showed that while there was no difference in the basal level of the constituent proteins of the TSC complex between WT and Cln1 -/-mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4A</ref>), the levels of phosphorylated TSC2 (Ser939) were significantly higher in Cln1 -/-mouse brain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4B</ref>). Since the activation of Rheb requires the conversion of GDP-Rheb (inactive) to GTP-Rheb (active), we measured the level of active Rheb by pull-down assay using antibody to GTP-Rheb. Our results showed that although there was no difference in the total level of Rheb between WT and Cln1 -/-mice, there was a significantly higher level of active Rheb in Cln1 -/- mouse brain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4C</ref>). We also evaluated the phosphorylation status of a 40-kDa proline-rich Akt-substrate-40 (PRAS40), which releases its inhibitory effects on Raptor promoting the activation of mTORC1 signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(85)</ref>. The results showed that in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice, the levels of pPRAS40 were significantly higher than those in their WT littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4D</ref>). Since phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) catalyzes the phosphorylation of TSC2 and PRAS40, we measured the levels of pAkt in the brain of WT and Cln1 -/-mice. We found that compared with WT mice, the pAkt levels in Cln1 -/-littermates were significantly higher (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4E</ref>). Our results also showed that in Cln1 -/-mice, there was a markedly higher level of pGSK-3β (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4, B</ref> and<ref type="figure">C</ref>), which is a substrate of Akt. Taken together, these results suggested that PI3K/Akt is at least one of the pathways that mediate aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling in this mouse model of CLN1 disease.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor-1 mediates aberrant mTORC1 signaling in Cln1 -/-mice The lysosomal degradative function is highly integrated with cues from intracellular nutrients, which promote translocation of mTORC1 from the cytoplasm to the lysosomal membrane. Signals generated from growth factors are relayed by phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt-mediating mTORC1 activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(86)</ref>. Both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) can mediate the activation of PI3K/Akt (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4D</ref>). To delineate whether mTORC1 signaling is mediated via growth factor pathway, we first measured the levels of both insulin and IGF1 in cortical tissues from WT and Cln1 -/-mice. We found that while there was no significant difference in the levels of insulin among these animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4E</ref>), the level of IGF1 in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice was significantly higher than that in their WT littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4F</ref>). Interestingly, even though the IGF1receptor levels were unaltered in Cln1 -/-mouse brain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4F</ref>), the phosphorylated PI3K level was appreciably higher (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4G</ref>). The PI3K catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3). While PIP3 is required for the activation of AKT by PDK1, PTEN catalyzes the conversion of PIP3 back to phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4D</ref>). Notably, the levels of phosphorylated PTEN were significantly reduced in Cln1 -/-mouse brain (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S4G</ref>). Cumulatively, these results suggested that in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice, the aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling, at least in part, is mediated by IGF1 via PI3K/Akt pathway.</p><p>Earlier studies have indicated that mTORC1 can be activated by spatial association with focal adhesions near the plasma membrane. Coupling of mTORC1 with growth factor signaling and amino acid input into the cell may be sufficient to activate mTORC1, even when it is not on the lysosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(87)</ref>. It is therefore possible that mTORC1 in Cln1 -/-cells are activated near the plasma membrane in response to IGF1. We therefore determined the plasma membrane level Rheb, Raptor, and mTOR to determine if it was the site of mTORC1 activation in Cln1 -/-mouse brain. The results however indicated no difference in the plasma membrane level of Rheb, Raptor, or mTOR between WT and Cln1 -/-mouse (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5A</ref>). Earlier studies on mTOR localization using live and fixed cell imaging have shown that translocation of mTORC1 to lysosome is a transient event and occurs within minutes of amino acid addition. However, the chain of events following mTORC1 translocation is delayed suggesting a dynamic process of mTORC1 translocation for its activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(88)</ref>. Therefore, it may not be possible to capture a dynamic event from isolated plasma membrane fractions from mouse brain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/Akt suppresses mTORC1 activation</head><p>Thus far, our results have shown that Ppt1 deficiency in Cln1 -/-mice, via growth factor (IGF1)-mediated pathway, activated aberrant mTORC1 signaling. Next, we sought to determine whether nontoxic, pharmacological inhibitors of Akt may suppress aberrant mTORC1 activation and rescue autophagy in PPT1-deficient cells. Since Cln1/Ppt1 gene is universally expressed in all cells and tissues, we used cultured lymphoblasts from patients with CLN1 disease and those from age-and sex-matched healthy subjects to test the effects of these inhibitors (e.g., A674563, MK2206, Afuresertib, or Uprosertib). We quantified the levels of pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 before and after treatment of the cells with AKT inhibitors. The results showed that treatment of cultured lymphoblasts from CLN1 disease patients with recombinant PPT1 (positive control) significantly suppressed pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5B</ref>). Notably, treatment of these cells with pharmacological inhibitors of Akt also significantly suppressed pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 levels compared with those in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO)-treated controls (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5, B-D</ref>). Since AKT phosphorylates GSK3β we also measured the level pGSK3β to determine the extent of AKT inhibition. The results showed that treatment of cultured CLN1 disease lymphoblasts with Akt inhibitors also significantly reduced the level of pGSK3β (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5C</ref>), indicating the suppression of Akt activity. Furthermore, since the Akt inhibitors, Afuresertib and Uprosertib, are nontoxic and orally administrable (89), we treated Cln1 -/-mice with these drugs by gavage feeding. The results showed that after only 14 days of treatment, the levels of mTORC1 signaling in the brain of these mice were significantly lower than those in their untreated counterparts (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>). As expected, the levels of pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 in the brain of vehicle-treated mice were unaltered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S5E</ref>). We did not observe any adverse effects during this short period of treatment. It should be noted, however, that the Akt inhibitor, Afuresertib, is currently undergoing phase-2 clinical trial (NCT04374630) for the treatment of ovarian cancer. To further evaluate the beneficial and/or adverse effects of these drugs, we conducted a long-term (5 months) treatment of Cln1 -/-mice with Afuresertib starting at 1 month of age. Importantly, the results showed that long-term treatment of Cln1 -/-mice with Afuresertib significantly reduced the levels of pS6K1, p4E-BP1, and pGSK3β in these mice compared with those in the untreated controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5C</ref>). Notably, we did not observe any apparent adverse effects. Taken together, these results suggested that treatment of cells from CLN1 disease patients in vitro as well as Cln1 -/-mice with nontoxic pharmacological inhibitors of Akt such as Afuresertib suppressed aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling with no apparent adverse effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K/Akt rescues autophagy</head><p>Since the activation of mTORC1 signaling suppresses autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref> and loss of autophagy in the brain causes neurodegeneration <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>, we sought to determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of Akt may rescue autophagy in PPT1-deficient cells and in Cln1 -/-mice. Accordingly, we determined the level of LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 to evaluate the status of autophagy in CLN1 disease lymphoblasts with/ without treatment with Akt inhibitors. The results showed that the levels of both autophagy markers, LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 in treated cultured lymphoblasts from CLN1 disease patients were reduced in a dose-dependent manner and comparable to levels in lymphoblasts from healthy adults (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6A</ref>). Since phosphorylation of ULK and ATG13 is directly regulated by mTORC1, we measured the levels of pULK and pATG13 levels in cultured lymphoblasts from healthy adults and CLN1 disease patients with/without Akt inhibitors. The results showed a significant reduction in the levels of phosphorylated, ULK and ATG13 in treated cultured lymphoblasts from CLN1 disease patients in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6A</ref>).</p><p>Next, we determined the level of LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 to evaluate the status of autophagy in untreated and Afuresertib-treated Cln1 -/-mice.

We also determined the phosphorylation status of the autophagy-related proteins ULK, ATG13, and ATG14 in cortical tissues from untreated and Afuresertib-treated mice. The results showed a significant reduction in the levels of phosphorylated, ATG13 and ATG14 in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice treated with Akt inhibitor compared with those of their untreated Cln1 -/-littermates (Fig. <ref type="figure">S6D</ref>). Taken together, these results showed that pharmacological suppression of mTORC1 activation in Cln1 -/- mice rescued autophagy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Afuresertib-treatment ameliorates neuroinflammation in</head><p>Cln1 -/-mice Despite the notion that the brain is an immune privileged site, it is not uncommon to encounter immune responses in this organ <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90)</ref>. The microglia and astrocytes are the primary constituents of the innate immune system in the central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(91)</ref>.

Recently, we reported that activated astrocytes stimulating microglia proliferation contributed to neuroinflammation mediating neuronal death in Cln1 -/-mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(92)</ref>. Therefore, we sought to determine if suppression of mTORC1 by Afuresertib arrested the progression of neuroinflammatory changes characteristically found in these animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93)</ref>. Accordingly, we evaluated the levels of the astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the microglial markers, CD68 and IBA1, respectively, by Western blot analysis. Our results showed a significantly higher levels of these proteins in the brain of untreated Cln1 -/-mice than those in the WT mice (Figu. 6, A-C). Remarkably, treatment of the Cln1 -/-mice with Afuresertib resulted in a substantially reduced levels of these neuroinflammatory markers (Fig. <ref type="figure">6, A-C</ref>). Confocal imaging of brain sections from Afuresertib-treated animals further confirmed a significant reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein-, CD68-, and IBA1-positive cells compared with those in untreated Cln1 -/-mice (Figs. <ref type="figure">6, D</ref> and<ref type="figure">E,</ref> and<ref type="figure">S6E</ref>).</p><p>Next, we sought to evaluate whether Afuresertib treatment reduced brain atrophy by measuring the cortical thickness and neuron density in Cln1 -/-mice. Accordingly, we evaluated the cortical thickness of WT, untreated, and Afuresertib-treated Cln1 -/-mice using H&amp;E staining. The results showed that compared with WT mice, there was significant reduction in cortical thickness in untreated Cln1 -/-mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7A</ref>). Remarkably, treatment of the Cln1 -/-mice with Afuresertib showed a modest but significant preservation of cortical thickness compared with that in untreated mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7A</ref>). We also analyzed the level of neurons by Nissl staining and detection of neuronal marker, NeuN, in cortical tissues of these animals by Western blot analysis. We found that treatment with Afuresertib significantly prevented the decline in the level Nissl-positive cells in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A</ref>). Moreover, the level of NeuN was also significantly higher in Cln1 -/-mice treated with Afuresertib than untreated Cln1 -/-mice (Fig. <ref type="figure">7B</ref>). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections for layer-specific neuronal markers, using Cux1 (for cortical layers II-IV) and Ctip2 (for cortical layers IV-VI) showed that there was a substantial reduction in the number of both Cux1-and Ctip2-positive neurons in the untreated Cln1 -/-mouse brain. Importantly, compared with untreated controls, Afuresertib-treatment provided significant protection of Cux1-and Ctip2-positive neurons (Fig. <ref type="figure">S7B</ref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that the pharmacological inhibitors of Akt are effective in suppressing aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling, which suppressed neuroinflammation, thereby, protecting the neurons from degeneration in this mouse model of CLN1 disease.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we sought to understand the mechanism underlying pathogenesis of CLN1 disease, a devastating neurodegenerative LSD, which mostly affect children and young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>. We uncovered that some of the proteins that are constituents of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold (e.g., vATPase and Lamtor1), require dynamic S-palmitoylation for their localization on lysosomal membrane where mTORC1 must attach for its activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>. We also found that the loss of Cln1/Ppt1 in Cln1 -/-mice caused misrouting of vATPase and Lamtor1, which most likely disrupted the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold impairing lysosomal nutrient sensing. Interestingly, a component of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold (e.g., SLC38A9), which does not undergo S-palmitoylation, also failed to localize on lysosomal surface, although the mechanism of this defect remained unclear. It has been reported that disruption of any component of the Ragulator complex suppresses the activation of mTORC1 by mistargeting the Rags as well as mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(95,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96)</ref>. Notably, the disruption of the Rag-Ragulator complex constituting the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold has been reported to suppress mTORC1 activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>. We reasoned that in Cln1 -/-mice failure of these Ragulator proteins to localize on lysosomal surface disrupted the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold. However, we found that despite this defect there was hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice from P1, which persisted throughout adulthood.</p><p>How might loss-of-function mutations in the Cln1 gene lead to mTORC1 hyperactivation and contribute to pathogenesis of CLN1 disease? In a recent unbiased proteomic study, using synaptosomes from WT and Cln1 -/-mice &gt;100 proteins have been identified as PPT1 substrates <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Although the physiological functions of these proteins remain largely unknown, some of them may require dynamic S-palmitoylation for their localization in various cellular compartments. Thus, it is conceivable that Cln1 mutations may impair dynamic S-palmitoylation of some of these proteins rendering them to promote various pathways of mTORC1 activation suppressing autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref> contributing to neurodegeneration in CLN1 disease.

Recently, by isolating autophagic vesicles from mouse brain it has been demonstrated that nucleoid-associated proteins are enriched in these vesicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(96)</ref>.

The V0a1 subunit of vATPase requires dynamic Spalmitoylation for trafficking to the lysosomal surface and in PPT1-deficient Cln1 -/-mice, this critical subunit of vATPase is misrouted to the plasma membrane instead of its normal location on lysosomal membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>. While the specific substrates of PPT1 are yet to be identified and characterized, it is possible that this enzyme may have a role in promoting dynamic S-palmitoylation of some of the proteins that are constituents of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold. Consequently, PPT1 deficiency may misroute these proteins to unintended targets. Our results confirmed that Cys3 and Cys4 in both human and mouse Lamtor 1 are S-palmitoylated. Furthermore, our study revealed that PPT1 deficiency in Cln1 -/-mice also misrouted Lamtor 1 to the plasma membrane. Since lysosomal localization of Lamtor1 as well as vATPase is critical for the organization of the Ragulator complex, misrouting of Lamtor 1, and vATPase to the plasma membrane most likely disrupted the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold. Notably, the Rag GTPases tethered to the lysosomal membrane by a Rag GTPase/Ragulator scaffold brings mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface where its signaling pathway is activated. Although the disruption of lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold has been reported to inhibit mTORC1 activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>, our results showed that despite this defect, mTORC1 was aberrantly activated in the brain of Cln1 -/-mice. We reasoned that even though the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold may be disrupted, a cell may utilize alternative pathways for the activation of mTORC1 signaling in Cln1 -/-mouse brain.</p><p>The convergence of a complex molecular machinery on the lysosomal surface ensures that signals generated from growth nutrition, energy, and stress-regulating cell growth and proliferation through phosphorylation of substrates that activate various anabolic processes like protein, lipid, and nucleotide synthesis and inhibit catabolic processes like autophagy. The lysosomal nutrition sensing scaffold (LNSS) (consisting of V-ATPase and Rag-Ragulator complex), plays critical roles in amino acid sensing and mTORC1 activation. The growth factor pathway consisting of the PI3K and AKT also regulates mTORC1 activation through the TSC complex (TSC1, TSC2, TBCD17) and RheB. Upon activation, AKT phosphorylates TSC2 and inhibits it promoting the conversion of Rheb-GDP (inactive) to Rheb-GTP (active), which can then activate mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface. Despite misvocalization of the components of the LNSS complex in Cln1 -/-cells the mTORC1 is activated via the growth factor-mediated pathway. Constitutive activation of mTORC1 in Cln1 -/-cells contributes to the suppression of autophagy and increased cell proliferation contributing to neurodegeneration in CLN1 disease. CLN, ceroid lipofuscinosis neuronal; AKT, protein kinase B; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; IGFR, insulin-like growth factor receptor; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor-1; mTORC1, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex-1; Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain.</p><p>factors can activate mTORC1 and this pathway is tightly regulated. A small GTPase, Rheb, allosterically binds to lysosomal membrane and activates mTORC1 in a highly coordinated manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(84)</ref>. Moreover, the growth factors like insulin and IGF1 have been reported to mediate the activation of mTORC1 signaling via TSC1, TSC2, and Rheb GTPase <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86)</ref>. Our results are consistent with this mechanism as they show that the level of IGF1 in Cln1 -/-mouse brain is significantly than that in the brain of their WT littermates. Moreover, we found that IGF1-mediated activation of mTORC1 signaling via phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt causing Rheb to localize on the lysosomal membrane. Therefore, even though the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold may be disrupted in Cln1 -/-mice, IGF1 via PI3K/Akt provided an alternative pathway to mediate the aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling.</p><p>How might aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling in the brain leads to neuropathology in this mouse model of CLN1 disease? One of the consistent clinical findings in CLN1 disease is the development of seizures <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. Recently, it has been reported that hyperactive mTORC1 plays a critical role in the development of epilepsy, ameliorated by fasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82)</ref>. Indeed, it has been shown that hyperactive mTORC1 signaling causes epilepsy and inhibition of mTORC1 reduces seizures in this model of epilepsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">99)</ref>. Persistent mTORC1 activation has been reported to mediate both neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. The activation of mTORC1 in dividing cells as well as in postmitotic cells like the neurons have been reported to dysregulate autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>. Indeed, suppression of autophagy is found in virtually all LSDs in which neurodegeneration is a devastating manifestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. It is noteworthy that the molecular details of mTORC1 activation and its regulation have been investigated almost exclusively using in vitro experimental models <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">100)</ref>. While the in vitro cell culture models provide important information, the results may not always be extrapolated in vivo. Thus, studies using animal models provide an additional measure of confirmation of the results obtained from the in vitro experiments.</p><p>Intense research for more than several decades have shown that the PI3K signaling regulates virtually all aspects of normal cellular function and dysregulation of one or more proteins in the PI3K-signaling pathway invariably leads to human pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(101,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">102)</ref>. Our results show that despite disruption of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold, aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling in Cln1 -/-mouse brain occurs via growth factor (IGF1)-mediated pathway. Since this pathway required phosphorylation of Akt, we sought to determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of Akt-phosphorylation may suppress the aberrant activation of mTORC1 signaling. Accordingly, we treated both Cln1 -/-mice and cultured lymphoblasts from CLN1 disease patients with A674563, MK2206, Afuresertib, or Uprosertib and evaluated the activation of mTORC1 signaling by quantitating pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 levels. The results showed that Akt inhibitors were effective in significantly reducing the levels of phosphorylated canonical substrates of mTORC1 kinase. These results suggested that inhibition of growth factor-mediated pathway suppresses mTORC1 activation. To further confirm the effects of these inhibitors in vivo, we treated 1-month-old Cln1 -/-mice for 2 weeks with the orally administrable AKT inhibitors (Afuresertib and Uprosertib) and measured pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 levels. We found that the levels of pS6K1 and p4E-BP1 were substantially downregulated suggesting the effectiveness of these inhibitors in vivo. Studies with various Akt-inhibitors have been reported to reduce glial activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">103)</ref>. Further, we found that long-term treatment with Afuresertib not only suppressed aberrant mTORC1 signaling but also reduced glial activation, microglial proliferation, and improved motor function in the treated Cln1 -/-mice.</p><p>Numerous proteins in the brain require dynamic S-palmitoylation (palmitoylation-depalmitoylation) for endosomal trafficking and function. While S-palmitoylation is catalyzed by ZDHHCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>, depalmitoylation is mediated by thioesterases <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. The results of our present investigation support a model in which the activation of mTORC1 signaling in WT mice is regulated primarily by lysosomal nutrient sensing via the Rag-Ragulator pathway (Fig. <ref type="figure">7D</ref>, left panel). For example, when the nutritional content in the cell is low, as happens during parturition, activation of autophagy generates energy required for survival of the fetus. However, in PPT1deficient Cln1 -/-mice misrouting of several constituent proteins of the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold to the plasma membrane most likely disrupts the lysosomal nutrient sensing scaffold disabling the nutrition-sensing pathway of mTORC1 activation. In the PPT1-deficient Cln1 -/-mice, impaired nutrient-mediated mTORC1 signaling promotes its activation via growth factor (i.e., IGF1)-mediated pathway, which requires phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. <ref type="figure">7D</ref>, right panel). Our results have shown that in Cln1 -/-mice, mTORC1 remains persistently activated from P1, which continues through adulthood. Activated mTORC1 in Cln1 -/-mouse brain suppresses autophagy, contributing to neurodegeneration. Interestingly, activation of mTORC1 signaling in both hippocampal neurons and non-neuronal cells has been reported to require dynamic S-palmitoylation of Lam-tor1 as well as mTOR <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>. We confirmed that Lamtor1 is Spalmitoylated but have not determined whether mTOR is also required S-palmitoylation for localization on lysosomal surface. Recently, it has been shown that S-palmitoylation plays a regulatory role on Akt <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(103)</ref>. It remains unclear, however, whether Akt undergoes dynamic S-palmitoylation for its role in IGF-mediated mTORC1 activation and how this pathway may be affected by PPT1 deficiency in Cln1 -/-mice. The phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt, localized upstream of the IGF1-mediated mTORC1 activation, when inhibited by a pharmacological inhibitor of this pathway suppressed mTORC1 signaling, which rescued autophagy. Moreover, this treatment also inhibited neuroinflammation, which protected neurons and preserved motor function in Cln1 -/-mice. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized role of CLN1/PPT1 in regulating mTORC1 activation and how PPT1 deficiency may contribute to a pathway leading to neurodegeneration in CLN1 disease.</p></div>

For testing the endurance on rotarod, we used 6-and 8-month-old WT (n = 7), untreated (n = 7) and Afuresertib-treated Cln1 -/-(n = 7) mice. Animals were habituated in the training room and trained (at Rotarod speed 8 rpm) twice for 1 min each for 4 days. Animals were given 1 min rest between two trials. On the 5th and the final day, the animals were designated as group A (WT), group B (untreated Cln1 -/-) and group C (Afuresertib-treated Cln1 -/-) The tests were performed in the same training room, by a single operator who was unaware of the identity of the groups. The animals were allowed to stay on the rotating rod for up to 300 s. All the training sessions and the final rotarod test were conducted at the same time in the morning between 9 AM and 11 AM.</p></div>
