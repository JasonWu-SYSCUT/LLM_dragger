<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To the editor, Carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 1A deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive condition deriving from a mutation in the CPT1A gene. Carnitine is found in nearly all cells of the body, and the CPT pathway has a crucial role in energy production through its enzyme and transporting functions. CPT1A (the hepatic isoform) is located on the outside of the mitochondrial membrane and is essential in transport of fatty acids to facilitate fatty acid oxidation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> A defect in the CPT1A pathway results in the inability to transport or break down longchain fatty acids.</p><p>CPT1A deficiency commonly presents in children with symptoms of hypoketotic hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, and encephalopathy during periods of fasting. The worldwide incidence is 1:500,000 to 1:1,000,000. Diagnosis is made by finding elevated total and free plasma carnitine levels and confirmed by a demonstrable mutation of the CPT1A gene or by means of enzyme activity in fibroblasts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> We describe a case of CPT1A deficiency presenting with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) in a previously well adult. It is believed to be the first reported case of an adult presentation requiring liver transplantation for hepatic failure due to CPT1A deficiency. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to submission of this case report.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CASE REPORT</head><p>A 21-year-old previously well female of Indian descent presented with 3 weeks of malaise, lethargy, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Painless jaundice was noted 3 days prior to presentation. There was no recent travel, no medications, over-the-counter or recreational drug history, no alcohol use, and no family history of liver disease. She had hepatic impairment with an INR 1.8, bilirubin 391 μmol/L, alanine transaminase (ALT) 80 U/L, aspartate transaminase (AST) 153 U/L, and albumin 27 g/L. Initial tests were negative for viral causes (hepatitis A, B, C, and E) and serum paracetamol level was absent. Blood glucose was 5.4 mmol/ L and urinalysis was negative for ketones.</p><p>Over 24 hours she developed grade 1 encephalopathy and was transferred to a liver transplant unit for management. There was evidence of grade 1 HE with nontender hepatomegaly, scleral icterus, and no ascites. Testing was negative for additional viral causes, autoimmune markers, and Wilson disease. Cross-sectional imaging revealed gross fatty infiltration of the liver. Liver biopsy demonstrated a macrovesicular steatohepatitis with a NAFLD activity score (NAS) of 6 and NASH fibrosis stage 1b. Blood triglyceride level was elevated at 3.3 mmol/L.</p><p>Over the subsequent 72 hours, the patient developed multiorgan dysfunction characterized by grade 3 encephalopathy, blood glucose level 0.7 mmol/L, and acute renal failure. Intensive care unit management included intubation, inotrope support, and dialysis. During this period, bilirubin was 125 μmol/L, ALT 528 U/L, AST 1144 U/L, and INR 2.0.</p><p>Emergency deceased donor liver transplant occurred 5 days after admission. During transplantation, the explant appeared to be grossly deposited with fat and required resection in 2 parts (Figure <ref type="figure">1 A</ref>). The posttransplant course was complicated by a bile leak and acute rejection. Multifactorial acute kidney injury occurred requiring peritransplant and post-transplant dialysis, resulting in chronic kidney impairment.</p><p>The explant liver pathology (Figure <ref type="figure">1B-D</ref>) suggested diffuse steatohepatitis with severe steatosis ( &gt;66%, macrovesicular and microvesicular), NAS 8, and NASH fibrosis stage 3. The presentation was inconsistent with NAFLD, and the possibility of a metabolic cause was entertained. Elevated plasma carnitine levels were found with whole exome sequencing showing a homozygous mutation in the CPT1A gene. Confirmatory testing with cultured skin fibroblasts was consistent with CPT1 deficiency (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), with CPT1 activity 0.13 nmol/min/ mg (normal control 0.92-1.23). Genetic familial screening of siblings was recommended.</p><p>Further history revealed she was born to nonconsanguineous parents with no history of similar illnesses or previous episodes of encephalopathy and excelled at school. Her younger brother was well with no similar presentations in extended family members. Her mother had not had any complications during pregnancies.</p><p>The patient was maintained on a high carbohydrate, normal protein, low-fat diet and advised to avoid prolonged periods of fasting. Following a period of rehabilitation she was discharged home.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>CPT1A deficiency is an incredibly rare metabolic condition. Most hepatic presentations in the literature have been in childhood with deranged liver function tests, jaundice, hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, or encephalopathy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> The outcome for those with CPT1A deficiency is expected to be normal; however, some patients develop neurological impairment from repeated periods of metabolic decompensation. Homozygous pregnant women should be monitored closely as the fetus may develop the condition which can then lead to acute fatty liver of pregnancy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Our patient presented in adulthood with no previous symptoms. The precipitant for the presentation was presumed to be anorexia and vomiting prior to admission; the cause of this was not determined. The degree of liver dysfunction was severe and despite maximal medical management resulted in liver transplantation. While there are some case reports of adults with CPT1A deficiency, most have had less severe presentations of liver dysfunction prior to presenting with liver failure or have been diagnosed in childhood. In one case report, an adult patient, not previously known to have CPT1A deficiency, presented with cholestatic jaundice during a pregnancy with Graves disease, and a subsequent presentation with jaundice and fatty liver during intercurrent illness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> This patient retrospectively had symptoms for many years.</p><p>It is not clear why our patient had chronic liver disease, as this is not normally seen in long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders; however, there are case reports of patients with CPT1A deficiency and features of chronic liver disease. An adult with CPT1A deficiency diagnosed in childhood presented with ACLF and had evidence of splenomegaly and varices. It is unclear if this patient proceeded to liver transplantation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> In another report, a child with CPT1A deficiency and cirrhosis was described. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> The mechanism of this is not clear and warrants further research. We hypothesize that episodic or persistent steatohepatitis leads to fibrosis.</p><p>This appears to be the first case of an adult presentation with CPT1A deficiency requiring liver transplantation for liver failure. CPT1A deficiency should be considered, along with other metabolic conditions, as a rare cause of liver failure. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>F</head><label></label><figDesc>I G U R E 1 (A) Explanted liver demonstrating severe steatosis.
