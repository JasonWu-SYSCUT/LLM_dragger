    "abstract": "Hedgehog signaling is involved in embryonic development and cancer growth. Functional activity of secreted Hedgehog signaling proteins is dependent on N-terminal palmitoylation, making the palmitoyl transferase Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT), a potential drug target and a series of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridines have been identified as HHAT inhibitors. Based on structural data, we designed and synthesized 37 new analogues which we profiled alongside 13 previously reported analogues in enzymatic and cellular assays. Our results show that a central amide linkage, a secondary amine, and (R)-configuration at the 4-position of the core are three key factors for inhibitory potency. Several potent analogues with low- or sub-muM IC(50) against purified HHAT also inhibit Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) palmitoylation in cells and suppress the SHH signaling pathway. This work identifies IMP-1575 as the most potent cell-active chemical probe for HHAT function, alongside an inactive control enantiomer, providing tool compounds for validation of HHAT as a target in cellular assays.\n",
    "fragment": "The Hedgehog (HH) signaling proteins Sonic (SHH), Indian (IHH), and Desert (DHH) Hedgehog, are secreted morphogens that play a critical role in development and disease, with SHH being the most studied homologue. SHH is post-translationally modified through covalent attachment of two lipids which are critical for functional signaling. 8 Intein-like autocatalytic cleavage of SHH precursor proteins results in the formation of a cholesteryl ester at the C-terminus of the signaling domain; 9,10 the signaling domain is subsequently Npalmitoylated by HHAT (Figure 1A), which is a multipass transmembrane protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. 11,12 HHAT specifically recognizes t h e fi r s t 1 1 a m i n o a c i d s o f p r o c e s s e d S H H (CGPGRGFGKRR), and is proposed to act as an Sacyltransferase at the N-terminal cysteine thiol; the resulting S-acyl cysteine thioester is proposed to rearrange through an Sto-N acyl shift to form a stable N-acyl modification at the Nterminal amine. 13 Recent structural determination of HHAT using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) shows that HHAT is composed of 12-transmembrane (TM) helices with both termini located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (Figure 1B). 14,15 These structures reveal that palmitoyl-CoA (Pal-CoA) binds to a continuous solvent cavity through HHAT. The structural changes caused by Pal-CoA binding from the cytosolic side leads to a rearrangement of the active site of HHAT and primes HHAT for SHH binding, positioning the two key residues (His379 and Asp339) in the catalytic core close to the thioester of Pal-CoA (Figure 1B). Subsequently, the SHH N-terminus binds to HHAT via a luminal cavity to access the active site for palmitoylation. Dually lipidated SHH is secreted from the signaling cell and binds its receptor Patched (PTCH) at the receiving cell, thereby releasing the inhibition of Smoothened (SMO). Subsequently, SMO accumulates in the primary cilium and activates downstream transcription factors of the GLI family that induce expression of HH-responsive genes. [16][17][18] Dysregulation of the HH pathway is connected with a variety of diseases including several types of cancer, chronic cholecystitis, and pulmonary fibrosis. 19,20 A synergistic combination of the Smoothened (SMO) inhibitor GDC-0449 (vismodegib) and doxorubicin-loaded PEG-PCL copolymer micelles as chemotherapeutic agent has recently been reported as a potential treatment strategy in fibroblastenriched pancreatic cancer. 21 In the case of basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, treatment with vismodegib results in clinically useful and rapid tumor regression, 22,23 although mutations in the target SMO rapidly drive resistance to vismodegib. 24,25 These findings have led to a growing interest in inhibitors of other targets in the HH pathway as tools to further investigate the impact of inhibition of HH signaling on disease progression. [26][27][28] HHAT is a potential drug target due to its key role in the maturation process and HHAT mediated SHH N-palmitoylation is essential for HH signaling. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that mutation of the N-terminal cysteine of SHH prevents palmitoylation and abolishes induction of neuronal cell differentiation and limb patterning in mice, 29 and knockdown of HHAT produces antiproliferative effects on cells dependent on HH signaling for growth. 30 A class of 5-acyl-6,7-dihydrothieno [3,2-c]pyridine small molecule HHAT inhibitors were previously identified. 27 Early studies focused on compound RUSKI-43 (3); [31][32][33] however, chemical biology profiling demonstrated that RUSKI-43 exhibits significant off-target toxicity independent of HHAT inhibition (Figure 1C). 26,34 A related analogue RUSKI-201 (22) acts on-target within the concentration range required to inhibit HHAT and displays limited off-target toxicity. 35 Metabolic labeling of cells with an alkyne palmitic acid analogue followed by bioorthogonal \"click chemistry\" functionalization and isolation of modified proteins for identification by quantitative proteomics demonstrated that treatment with RUSKI-201 only affects palmitoylation of HH proteins, supporting the hypothesis that HH proteins are the only substrates of HHAT and highlighting HHAT as a selective target to block HH signaling. 35 A preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) study on this series identified IMP-1575 (30) as the most potent HHAT inhibitor  to-date, with an IC 50 of 0.75 \u03bcM for inhibition of purified HHAT. The binding mode of IMP-1575 was determined through both photoaffinity labeling and cryo-EM, indicating that IMP-1575 binds to the HHAT active site and is a potent competitive inhibitor of Pal-CoA (K i = 38 nM), blocking substrate access to two key catalytic residues (Asp339 and His379) and causing rearrangement of a gatekeeper residue (Trp335) to block the Pal-CoA binding channel. 14,36 Here we report the first comprehensive SAR study and profiling of tetrahydropyridine HHAT inhibitors in cells. We synthesized 37 novel derivatives and compared their potency alongside 13 known inhibitors [36][37][38] in purified HHAT assays and cytotoxicity screens, and progressed compounds with high inhibitory potency and low cytotoxicity into a cell-based substrate tagging assay for in-cell target engagement, alongside a dual-luciferase reporter assay to assess downstream SHH pathway inhibition. We demonstrate that IMP-1575 and its inactive enantiomer are robust tool molecules to study HHAT inhibition in cells, and deliver a comprehensive pharmacophore determination for HHAT inhibition, off-target toxicity, and metabolic stability.",
    "fullText": "**\u25a0 INTRODUCTION**\nThe membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) protein superfamily is found in all kingdoms of life and catalyzes transfer of acyl groups from acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) to a range of substrates. The majority of MBOATs transfer lipids to small molecule substrates such as glycerol; however, three MBOATs in mammals modify signaling peptides or proteins. Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), Porcupine (PORCN), and Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT), acylate Ghrelin, Wnt, and Hedgehog proteins, respectively. 1,2 These acyltransferase enzymes are potential drug targets in type II diabetes and obesity (GOAT), neurodegeneration (PORCN), and cancer (PORCN and HHAT). Inhibitors of PORCN are under active development for the treatment of neurological disorders and cancers, with inhibitors WNT974 and ETC-159 in early phase clinical trials. [3][4][5] Inhibition of GOAT by peptide-coenzyme A product mimetic GO-CoA-Tat, along with triterpenoid-based inhibitors, indicate a potential route to target this MBOAT for therapeutic benefit in type II diabetes and obesity. 6,7 However, inhibitor development programs targeting HHAT have shown more limited progress to-date.\nThe Hedgehog (HH) signaling proteins Sonic (SHH), Indian (IHH), and Desert (DHH) Hedgehog, are secreted morphogens that play a critical role in development and disease, with SHH being the most studied homologue. SHH is post-translationally modified through covalent attachment of two lipids which are critical for functional signaling. 8 Intein-like autocatalytic cleavage of SHH precursor proteins results in the formation of a cholesteryl ester at the C-terminus of the signaling domain; 9,10 the signaling domain is subsequently Npalmitoylated by HHAT (Figure 1A), which is a multipass transmembrane protein that resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. 11,12 HHAT specifically recognizes t h e fi r s t 1 1 a m i n o a c i d s o f p r o c e s s e d S H H (CGPGRGFGKRR), and is proposed to act as an Sacyltransferase at the N-terminal cysteine thiol; the resulting S-acyl cysteine thioester is proposed to rearrange through an Sto-N acyl shift to form a stable N-acyl modification at the Nterminal amine. 13 Recent structural determination of HHAT using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) shows that HHAT is composed of 12-transmembrane (TM) helices with both termini located on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane (Figure 1B). 14,15 These structures reveal that palmitoyl-CoA (Pal-CoA) binds to a continuous solvent cavity through HHAT. The structural changes caused by Pal-CoA binding from the cytosolic side leads to a rearrangement of the active site of HHAT and primes HHAT for SHH binding, positioning the two key residues (His379 and Asp339) in the catalytic core close to the thioester of Pal-CoA (Figure 1B). Subsequently, the SHH N-terminus binds to HHAT via a luminal cavity to access the active site for palmitoylation. Dually lipidated SHH is secreted from the signaling cell and binds its receptor Patched (PTCH) at the receiving cell, thereby releasing the inhibition of Smoothened (SMO). Subsequently, SMO accumulates in the primary cilium and activates downstream transcription factors of the GLI family that induce expression of HH-responsive genes. [16][17][18] Dysregulation of the HH pathway is connected with a variety of diseases including several types of cancer, chronic cholecystitis, and pulmonary fibrosis. 19,20 A synergistic combination of the Smoothened (SMO) inhibitor GDC-0449 (vismodegib) and doxorubicin-loaded PEG-PCL copolymer micelles as chemotherapeutic agent has recently been reported as a potential treatment strategy in fibroblastenriched pancreatic cancer. 21 In the case of basal cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma, treatment with vismodegib results in clinically useful and rapid tumor regression, 22,23 although mutations in the target SMO rapidly drive resistance to vismodegib. 24,25 These findings have led to a growing interest in inhibitors of other targets in the HH pathway as tools to further investigate the impact of inhibition of HH signaling on disease progression. [26][27][28] HHAT is a potential drug target due to its key role in the maturation process and HHAT mediated SHH N-palmitoylation is essential for HH signaling. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that mutation of the N-terminal cysteine of SHH prevents palmitoylation and abolishes induction of neuronal cell differentiation and limb patterning in mice, 29 and knockdown of HHAT produces antiproliferative effects on cells dependent on HH signaling for growth. 30 A class of 5-acyl-6,7-dihydrothieno [3,2-c]pyridine small molecule HHAT inhibitors were previously identified. 27 Early studies focused on compound RUSKI-43 (3); [31][32][33] however, chemical biology profiling demonstrated that RUSKI-43 exhibits significant off-target toxicity independent of HHAT inhibition (Figure 1C). 26,34 A related analogue RUSKI-201 (22) acts on-target within the concentration range required to inhibit HHAT and displays limited off-target toxicity. 35 Metabolic labeling of cells with an alkyne palmitic acid analogue followed by bioorthogonal \"click chemistry\" functionalization and isolation of modified proteins for identification by quantitative proteomics demonstrated that treatment with RUSKI-201 only affects palmitoylation of HH proteins, supporting the hypothesis that HH proteins are the only substrates of HHAT and highlighting HHAT as a selective target to block HH signaling. 35 A preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) study on this series identified IMP-1575 (30) as the most potent HHAT inhibitor  to-date, with an IC 50 of 0.75 \u03bcM for inhibition of purified HHAT. The binding mode of IMP-1575 was determined through both photoaffinity labeling and cryo-EM, indicating that IMP-1575 binds to the HHAT active site and is a potent competitive inhibitor of Pal-CoA (K i = 38 nM), blocking substrate access to two key catalytic residues (Asp339 and His379) and causing rearrangement of a gatekeeper residue (Trp335) to block the Pal-CoA binding channel. 14,36 Here we report the first comprehensive SAR study and profiling of tetrahydropyridine HHAT inhibitors in cells. We synthesized 37 novel derivatives and compared their potency alongside 13 known inhibitors [36][37][38] in purified HHAT assays and cytotoxicity screens, and progressed compounds with high inhibitory potency and low cytotoxicity into a cell-based substrate tagging assay for in-cell target engagement, alongside a dual-luciferase reporter assay to assess downstream SHH pathway inhibition. We demonstrate that IMP-1575 and its inactive enantiomer are robust tool molecules to study HHAT inhibition in cells, and deliver a comprehensive pharmacophore determination for HHAT inhibition, off-target toxicity, and metabolic stability.\n\n**\u25a0 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**\n**Design and Synthesis of HHAT Inhibitor Analogues.**\nOur inhibitor-bound HHAT cryo-EM structure demonstrates that IMP-1575 (30) binds to the active site of HHAT, forming two hydrogen bonds. 14 One is between the carbonyl of IMP-1575 and HHAT His379; the other between the secondary amine of IMP-1575 and Asp339 (Figure 2). As noted above, IMP-1575 causes a rearrangement of Trp335 in the reaction center and thereby blocks Pal-CoA loading, consequently inhibiting HHAT activity. Our preliminary SAR investigation of analogues of RUSKI-201 also revealed that the amine is critical for inhibition, and changes to the nitrogen position or substitution lead to a decrease in activity. 36 The cryo-EM structure also confirms that the stereogenic center of IMP-1575 is the (R) configuration. In addition, docking studies suggested that the (R)-enantiomer of RUSKI-43 (3) occupied a similar space in the pocket (Figure 2), forming two hydrogen bonds with the same two residues (Asp339 and His379) as IMP-1575. The binding modes of IMP-1575 and RUSKI-43 in HHAT show that there are additional binding cavities around the aliphatic amine chain, thiophene ring, and 4-position of the core. We synthesized and tested 50 analogues to investigate whether favorable binding contacts could be formed in these regions, using various amino acids to introduce substituents into the \u03b1-position of the aliphatic amine chain. The thiophene ring was removed or exchanged for different substituted aromatic systems, and the substituent at the 4-position of the tetrahydropyridine core was varied with differently substituted aromatic or aliphatic rings.\nWe have previously reported synthetic routes to this class of HHAT inhibitors, [36][37][38] which can be divided into four groups based on pharmacophores. Compounds 1-36 are 4,5,6,7tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridines and 37-45 are 1,2,3,4tetrahydroisoquinolines. Compound 46 contains a 1,2,3,4tetrahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine core, while compounds 47-50 have a piperidine core. The synthesis of some analogues (1-6, 14-26, 28, 30, 31, 33, and 35) has been reported previously, [36][37][38] and new analogues were prepared following the synthetic methods in Schemes 1 and 2. In general, Bischler-Napieralski cyclization and subsequent reduction of the imine 39 were employed to prepare the heterocyclic cores, which were coupled with various carboxylic acids, followed by Boc-deprotection where required to afford the final compounds. Urea-linked analogues were synthesized via carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) mediated coupling reaction. Chiral preparative HPLC was used to obtain the (S)-or (R)enantiomers in >95% ee. Analogues are numbered and grouped based on their structures (Table 1 andTable 2); all final products were characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and HRMS, with enantiomers further confirmed by chiral HPLC.\nTo further expedite analogue synthesis, we recently developed a more concise route toward the synthesis of compound 24. In our optimized synthetic route, a Pictet-Spengler reaction is used to build the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno- [3,2-c]pyridine core in a one-pot reaction from 2-thiopheneethylamine and 6-methylpicolinaldehyde with higher yields. 36 To accelerate side chain synthesis, chloro acetamide was installed to provide a functional group that can be coupled to various amines (Scheme 3). This improved route offers the potential to rapidly prepare analogues with a diverse range of substitutions.\nAnalysis of Purified HHAT Inhibition Using the Acyl-cLIP Assay. The inhibitory potency of all 50 compounds against purified HHAT was quantified using the acylationcoupled lipophilic induction of polarization (acyl-cLIP) assay recently developed in our lab, a universally applicable assay for high-throughput analysis of protein-lipid transferases and hydrolases. 31,40 In brief, in this assay a fluorescently labeled peptide based on the N-terminal sequence of SHH is incubated with N-dodecyl \u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM) solubilized purified HHAT, palmitoyl-CoA, and HHAT inhibitors. Binding of the lipidated peptide product to the DDM micelle results in decreased tumbling rate and an increase in polarization of fluorescence emission, enabling facile quantification of HHAT activity. Initially, % HHAT inhibition was determined at 50 \u03bcM and 25 \u03bcM for all analogues. Subsequently, IC 50 values were obtained for all compounds that showed an HHAT inhibition >50% at 25 \u03bcM (Table 1 and 2, more details in Supporting Information (SI), Table S1 and Figure S1). HHAT is a 12-pass TM protein, 14 and we considered whether lipophilicity might bias inhibition; pIC 50 values were compared to calculated log D, which indicated no significant correlation (SI, Table S1 and Figure S2). We concluded that lipophilicity is not a general driver of HHAT inhibitory potency.\nWe first explored the SAR of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2c]pyridines. Acyl-cLIP assays revealed that nonacylated core molecules (1, 4, 14, and 20) were inactive against HHAT. Allylated compound 15 also shows no inhibitory effect against HHAT, in line with structural analysis indicating the carbonyl oxygen of the side chain forms a hydrogen-bond to His379 (Figure 2A). The existence of this interaction is further supported by the different activity between acetamide compound 5 and the less potent thioamide derivative 6, because thioamides are generally weaker hydrogen-bond acceptors than oxoamides. 41 To further explore whether additional groups could be accommodated in the binding cavity, the side chain was replaced by \u03b1-functionalized natural or unnatural amino acids (7-11). Remarkably, no compound in this subseries showed more than 50% inhibition of HHAT at 25 \u03bcM, presumably due to the steric demand of the additional substituents at the \u03b1-carbon of the side chain. Additionally, the decreased activity of allyl compound 15 compared to acrylamide 16, as well as the potency of 18 and 21, all point to the conclusion that an amide bond at the 5position is crucial for the potency of the analogues.\nAlthough previously identified inhibitors contain a secondary amine in the side chain (e.g., 17 and 22), 26,35 which forms an ionic interaction between the secondary amine and Asp339, acetyl and acryloyl derivatives (5, 16, 18, and 21) show potency with IC 50 values of 5.3, 15, 24, and 13 \u03bcM against HHAT, respectively, despite their simplified structures. However, changing the side chain to a lipophilic C8 short chain fatty acid (13) resulted in a loss of activity, highlighting a size limit in the binding cavity. Analogue 26 in which the amide and the secondary amine was exchanged for a urea regioisomer significantly decreased inhibitory activity in comparison to 25. 36 Three different alkyl groups were investigated as secondary amine substituents (compounds 22, 24, and 25); however, the isobutyl of IMP-1575 remained the most favorable substituent. We conclude that both position and substitution of the secondary amine is important to allow formation of the ionic interaction with Asp339.\nThe 4-position on the core tolerates various substituents containing an aromatic ring. Compounds 2 and 12 both contain a 2-(allylamino)acetyl side chain and exhibit similar potency, despite bearing (4-chlorophenoxy)methyl and phenyl substitutions on the 4-position, respectively. Another group of compounds 3, 17, 19, 22, 32, and 34, which only differ on the 4-position, show IC 50 values between 1.4 and 8.1 \u03bcM, again illustrating that the 4-position has high tolerability toward substitution. Interestingly, compounds 3, 17, and 22, which all feature a meta-methyl group on the 4-position aromatic ring, are about 2-5-fold more potent than analogues 19, 32, and 34. Exchanging the aryl substituent with an aliphatic cyclohexane ring led to the loss of activity of compounds 35 and 36, suggesting a potential \u03c0-stacking interaction in aryl derivatives. Taken together, aryl containing substituents are well tolerated on the 4-position of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridines and show potential for further optimization to improve binding potency.\nThe absolute configuration at the 4-position is critical for the inhibitory potency of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno [3,2-c]pyridines against HHAT. The (S)-enantiomers (27 and 28) have no inhibitory activity against HHAT, while the (R)-enantiomers (29 and 30) show a 2-fold increase in potency compared to racemates 21 and 24. This important observation is in line with the binding mode and docking studies which show the (R)-configured core is critical for forming the two key Table 1. Summary of the Acyl-cLIP Assay and MTS Assay Results for 4,5,6,7-Tetrahydrothieno [3,2-c]pyridines Journal of Medicinal Chemistry hydrogen bonds. Docking of the (S)-enantiomer 28 showed a large deviation from the binding mode of IMP-1575 for the top 5 poses (SI, Figure S3) and suggested that the two key hydrogen bonds were lost, consistent with lack of inhibitory potency in 28. In contrast, inhibitors containing racemic or (S)-enantiomer of the (2-methylbutyl)glycine side chain (22  and 23) show no difference in activity against HHAT, indicating this chiral center is not critical for binding.\nHaving analyzed the impact of the 4-position aromatic group and the secondary amine side chain on inhibitory potency, we next investigated the thiophene moiety of IMP-1575. HHAT inhibitory potency was preserved when changing the thiophene to a phenyl ring, as long as the favorable substituents on the side chain were present (38 and 39). However, with an acetyl group at this position, 37 shows decreased activity compared to 38. Similar to compound 26, replacing the amide with a urea also led to inactivity of the tetrahydroisoquinoline analogues (40 and 41). The importance of the absolute conformation of the 4-position was also confirmed with this new core; the (R)-enantiomer (42) had no inhibitory activity, while the (S)-enantiomer (43) was 2-fold more potent than the racemate (39). Electron-donating dimethoxy substituents on the phenyl ring (44) resulted in a complete loss of HHAT inhibition. Decreasing electron density in the core by introducing a meta chloro substituent (45) did not interfere with inhibitory activity, while exchanging the thiophene with a pyrrole moiety (46) resulted in a loss of potency. Removing the heteroaromatic ring (47-50) resulted in a loss of potency. These findings indicate that a thiophene or phenyl substituent is essential; however, the influence on rigidity of the core may be more important than the effective electron density for this moiety. This can be explained by the X-H\u2022\u2022\u2022\u03c0 interaction between HHAT Asn443 and the thiophene of IMP-1575 or phenyl of 43 (Figure 3).\nToxicity of Compounds. The survival of HEK293a SHH + cells is independent of HH signaling, 35 therefore, the cytotoxicity of analogues was tested using the MTS assay to investigate off-target toxicity. In this assay, HEK293a SHH + cells were treated with DMSO vehicle or varying concentrations of analogues for 72 h. Subsequently, a mixture of 1- methoxy phenazine methosulfate (PMS) and [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] (MTS) was added to enable quantification of cell number via colorimetric analysis. The majority of active HHAT inhibitors exhibited minimal effect on cell viability (<30%) at 12.5 \u03bcM (compounds 5, 12, 18, 19, 21-25, 29, 30, 39, 43, and 45), while compounds 2 and 3 induced 44% and 69% decrease in cell survival, respectively, consistent with our previous finding that the mechanism-of-action for cytotoxicity of 2 and 3 is independent of HHAT (SI, Table S2 and Figure S4). 35  Compounds 3, 17, 19, 32, 34, 38, and 45, which all contain a 2-((2-methylbutyl)amino)acetyl, were toxic to HEK293a SHH + cells, as were ureas 26, 40, and 41. In contrast, analogues 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, 39, and 43 showed minimal toxicity in HEK293a SHH + cells (50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) > 50 \u03bcM) and good on-target potency in purified enzyme assays (HHAT IC 50 < 10 \u03bcM), indicating these analogues were suitable for further progression toward target engagement studies (Figure 4).\nCharacterizing Inhibitory Potency in Cellular Signaling. Compounds that showed both IC 50 < 20 \u03bcM in the acyl-cLIP assay and CC 50 > 10 \u03bcM in the MTS assay against HEK293a SHH + were progressed into cellular HH signaling assays (SI, Figure S2). The second selection step was essential to exclude artifacts resulting from nonspecific cytotoxicity, which would decrease viability and therefore signaling from SHH expressing cells. Inactive (S)-enantiomer 28 was included as a control to investigate the stereochemical stability of the tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine core in a cellular environment and to further control for off-target effects.\nWe first quantified the direct impact of previously reported HHAT inhibitors on palmitoylation of SHH using a cell-based metabolic tagging assay. 27,36 In this assay, HEK293a SHH + cells were incubated with varying concentrations of inhibitors in the presence of alkyne palmitic acid derivative YnPal (Figure 5A). 35 Following cell lysis and bioorthogonal derivatization of palmitoylated proteins with capture reagent azide-TAMRAbiotin (AzTB) 67 using a copper catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, AzTB-labeled SHH is shifted to higher apparent molecular weight in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), thereby enabling quantification of acylated SHH by \u03b1-SHH immunoblotting (compound 2, 17, and 22) or fluorescence imaging (compound 24, 28, and 30; SI, Figure S5-S6). 42 HHAT inhibitors that exhibited high potency in the acyl-cLIP assay also strongly inhibited SHH tagging by YnPal.   was the most potent and inhibited cellular YnPal labeling of SHH with a IC 50 of 76 nM, while the (S)-configuration counterpart 28 was inactive. These results demonstrate that compounds 28 and 30 remain stereochemically stable in a cellular environment and, moreover, 30 is highly potent in both enzymatic and cellular assays of HHAT function.\nSubsequently, the effect of analogues on HH signaling was investigated using a cellular luciferase reporter assay. Light2 cells derived from NIH3T3 cells constitutively express Renilla luciferase as an internal control for cell density alongside Firefly luciferase under the control of a HH-responsive Gli promoter. 43 HEK293a SHH + cells were incubated with varying inhibitor concentrations and SHH-containing conditioned media transferred to the NIH3T3-Light2 cells to mimic paracrine signaling 30,35 (Figure 6A). In this assay, 2, 17, 22, and 24 showed low \u03bcM to nM potency, 35 while 28 was inactive, in good agreement with the tagging assay, and highlighting the direct dependence of HH signaling on HHAT activity in cells (SI, Figure S6 and Table S3). Four compounds (19, 22, 30, and 43) exhibited nM potency against HH signaling, with IMP-1575 (30) again exhibiting the most potent EC 50 of 99 nM (Figure 6B, and SI, Figure S7). Furthermore, comparison of pEC 50 values from the Light2 cellular signaling assay against the pIC 50 data from the acyl-cLIP biochemical assay revealed a Pearson's correlation coefficient \u03c1 of 0.71 (p = 0.0021) (Figure 6C) between the cellular and enzymatic potencies of the inhibitors. Taking these data together, we conclude that IMP-1575 represents the optimal tool HHAT inhibitor to-date, with nM potency in both enzymatic assay and cellular assays and no detected offtarget cytotoxicity.\nMetabolic Stability and Pharmacokinetic Analysis. To assess the potential of HHAT inhibitors for in vivo target validation, drug metabolism and permeability studies were undertaken. The parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) was performed with compounds 2, 5, 17, 22, 37, and 38 (SI, Tables S5 andS6), where all compounds except compound 17 showed high passive permeability at pH 7.4. The passive permeability of compounds containing the secondary amine in the side chain (2, 17, 22, and 38) was pH dependent (SI, Table S4), while the acetylated derivatives  5 and 37 showed high permeability over the full pH range tested. The Caco-2 assay for compounds 2 and 22 indicated that these compounds had moderate-high permeability with no detectable efflux (SI, Table S5). However, microsomal stability experiments with inhibitors 2, 5, 17, 22, 30, 37, and 38 (Figure 7A) indicated that all tested compounds were rapidly metabolized (>90% after 15 min) in mouse liver microsomes (MLMs), which undermines the applications of this series for in vivo studies. Metabolite identification by mass spectrometry on 22 in MLM was performed to identify metabolically unstable sites, detecting five major metabolites and four possible labile sites (Figure 7B,C, and SI, Figure S8 and Table S6 andS7). Metabolites include N-dealkylation resulting from an isopentane loss in the side chain, two mono-oxidation and two bis-oxidation products that could be caused by S-oxidation at the thiophene moiety, N-oxidation at the secondary amine 44 and N-oxidation of the pyridine moiety 45 leading to hydroxylate derivatives. Taken together, compounds from this chemical series are cell permeable but metabolically unstable. Our findings on the pharmacophore for HHAT inhibition will help to guide future studies to improve the metabolic stability of this series of HHAT inhibitors.\n**\u25a0 CONCLUSIONS**\nHHAT inhibition holds high promise to block HH signaling from cancer cells. Supported by information from recent cryo-EM structures of HHAT, we have designed, synthesized, and evaluated 50 inhibitor analogues, including the most potent HHAT inhibitor reported in the literature to-date, IMP-1575. SAR analysis demonstrated that an aromatic ring with (R)absolute configuration at the 4-position of the core and the 5position amide carbonyl are essential for HHAT inhibition. Cellular assays show that IMP-1575 has no detectable offtarget toxicity in vitro and inhibits the palmitoylation of SHH as well HH signaling with nM potency in cells; an interesting question for future investigation remains whether HHAT inhibition impacts HH secretion as well as signaling. The (S)enantiomer 28 shows no inhibition in both enzyme and cellular assays and, in combination with IMP-1575, therefore provides a powerful set of tool molecules for investigation of HHAT activity in cells. We further determined that compounds from this series are highly metabolically unstable in mouse and human microsomes, at positions within the pharmacophore required for target inhibition. We conclude that new series of HHAT inhibitors are likely to be required to progress to HHAT target validation in vivo. In summary, we present IMP-1575 as an optimum molecule to investigate SHH signaling via HHAT inhibition in vitro (Table S7), along with extended SAR understanding to guide development of HHAT inhibitors in future.\n**\u25a0 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION**\nSynthesis of HHAT Inhibitor Analogues.

Subsequently, the absorption at 490 nm was recorded using an EnVision Xcite 2104 (PerkinElmer), and the response was normalized to vehicle control and Puromycin treated samples. Dose response curves were fitted to a \"sigmoidal dose response (variable slope)\" model using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).\nCell-Based Tagging Assay. HEK293a SHH + cells were plated at 500,000 cells/well of a 6-well plate in a volume of 3 mL/well and cultured for 24 h as described. Cells were treated with DMSO vehicle, or RUSKI compounds in DMSO (0.016-10 \u03bcM final). After 1 h, 3 \u03bcL of YnPal (20 mM DMSO stock; 20 \u03bcM final) were added and the cells were cultured for another 6 h. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and lysed using PBS supplemented with 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were scraped off the plates and lysates centrifuged at 13 000g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's procedure.\nThe click reaction in cell lysate was performed as previously described. 42 Briefly, 1 \u03bcL AzTB (10 mM in DMSO, 100x), 2 \u03bcL CuSO 4 (50 mM in H 2 O, 50x), 2 \u03bcL tris(2 carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) (50 mM in H 2 O, 50\u00d7), and 1 \u03bcL tris[(1benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA, 10 mM in DMSO, 100\u00d7) were mixed. Then 6 \u03bcL of this click mixture were added to 100 \u03bcL of lysate, adjusted with lysis buffer to a protein concentration of 1 mg/mL. The click reaction was shaken at RT for 1 h. Subsequently, proteins were precipitated by adding methanol, chloroform, and water at a ratio of 2:0.5:1 to remove click reagents and excess of AzTB. The mixture was centrifuged (13 000g, 5 min at 4 \u00b0C) and the methanol and water containing top layer removed. Following the addition of an excess of methanol, the precipitated proteins were isolated by centrifugation (13 000g, 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) and washed twice with methanol. The protein pellets were air-dried and redissolved in PBS containing 0.2% SDS and 0.1 mM DTT using sonication, and adjusted to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nFor enrichment of YnPal-labeled proteins, 100 \u03bcg of lysate were incubated with 30 \u03bcL of prewashed (3 \u00d7 500 \u03bcL of 0.2% SDS in PBS) Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Beads ware washed twice with 500 \u03bcL of 0.2% SDS in PBS and boiled for 10 min in 15 \u03bcL of PBS containing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The entire pull-down sample and 10 \u03bcg of total lysate and supernatant fractions were loaded on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Fluorescence was scanned using a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare; excitation laser: 532 nm, emission filter: LPG (575-700 nm); PMT: 750 V).\nProteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a wet transfer apparatus (100 V, 1 h). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS-T (0.1% Tween-20, 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation with SHH H-160 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-9024; 1:200 in TBS-T + 0.5% BSA) or \u03b1-tubulin primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; sc-8035; 1:200 in TBS-T + 0.5% BSA) at 4 \u00b0C. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and further incubated at RT for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody (HRP conjugated goatantimouse IgG (H+L) or goat-antirabbit IgG (H+L); Advansta; 1:10,000 in TBS-T + 0.5% BSA). Western blots were washed and developed with Luminata Crescendo Western HRP substrate (Millipore) on a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imager.\nTo determine the amount of YnPal labeled SHH, intensities of the corresponding bands in the fluorescence images were quantified using ImageJ 1.50i (National Institute of Health, USA). Corresponding values from biological duplicates were further evaluated using a \"sigmoidal dose response (variable slope)\" model in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.).\nCell-Based Signaling Assay. The Light2 cell-based signaling assay has been described previously. 35 Briefly, HEK293a SHH + cells were plated at 120,000 cells/well of a 12-well plate in a volume of 1 mL/ well and cultured as described above. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS, followed by addition of 1 mL of media containing 0.2% DMSO or varying inhibitor concentrations in DMSO (0.041-30 \u03bcM final). Additionally, SHH-Light2 cells were plated at 20,000 cells/well of a 96-well plate in 50 \u03bcL media. After another 24 h, 300 \u03bcL of the conditioned media were collected from each well of the treated HEK293a SHH + cells, centrifuged at 1000g for 10 min to remove detached cells and split into three wells of the SHH-Light2 cells (100 \u03bcL/well; 150 \u03bcL final volume in each well). The treated Light2 cells were cultured for another 48 h and subsequently washed with PBS. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter system (Promega Corporation, USA). Then 20 \u03bcL of 1\u00d7 passive lysis buffer were added to each well. After 30 min at RT, 5 \u03bcL of each lysate were transferred to a white opaque 96-well plate. Then 20 \u03bcL/well of luciferase assay reagent II was added and the luminescence immediately recorded using a SpectraMax i3x plate reader (Molecular Devices LLC). Subsequently, 20 \u03bcL/well of 1\u00d7 Stop&Glo substrate in Stop&Glo buffer was added and the luminescence immediately recorded for a second time. Data was evaluated using a \"sigmoidal dose response (variable slope)\" model in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). The luminescence signal of the Firefly luciferase was normalized to the DMSO vehicle (100%) and the unconditioned media (0%) controls.\nCaco-2 Permeability Assay. Apparent permeability (P app ) was determined in the Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell line. Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 for 10 days. Cells were plated onto a cell culture assembly plate (Millipore, UK) and monolayer confluency was checked using a TEER electrode prior to the assay. Medium was washed off and replaced in the appropriate apical and basal wells with HBSS buffer (pH 7.4) containing compounds (10 \u03bcM, 1% DMSO). The Caco-2 plate was incubated for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C, and Lucifer yellow was used to confirm membrane integrity postassay. Samples from the apical and basolateral chambers were analyzed against an external, matrix-matched, standard curve by LC-MS/MS using a Waters (Elstree, Herts. UK) Acquity Hclass LC system coupled to a Waters TQ-S mass spectrometer. P app was determined as follows: Microsomal Incubations. Metabolic stability assays were performed using a Microlab Star liquid handling workstation (Hamilton Robotics, Bonaduz, Switzerland). Test compounds (1 \u03bcM, 1% DMSO) were preincubated at 37 \u00b0C for 10 min in 0.5 mg/mL female CD1 mouse and mixed gender human liver microsomes in 10 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd. (Dorset, UK)). Microsomes were purchased either from Sekisui XenoTech, LLC (Kansas City, USA) or BioreclamationIVT (Frankfurt Am Main, Germany). Reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH (final concentration 1 mM). At 0, 15, and 30 min, aliquots were removed from each incubation and quenched in 3 volumes of ice-cold methanol containing olomoucine (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) as an internal standard. Inactive control incubations (without NADPH) were conducted in parallel. Samples were centrifuged at 3700 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min and the supernatant taken for analysis by LC-MS using an Agilent (Stockport, UK) 1290 LC system coupled to an Agilent 6520 QTOF mass spectrometer.

Functional activity of secreted Hedgehog signaling proteins is dependent on Nterminal palmitoylation, making the palmitoyl transferase Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT), a potential drug target and a series of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridines have been identified as HHAT inhibitors. Based on structural data, we designed and synthesized 37 new analogues which we profiled alongside 13 previously reported analogues in enzymatic and cellular assays. Our results show that a central amide linkage, a secondary amine, and (R)-configuration at the 4-position of the core are three key factors for inhibitory potency. Several potent analogues with low-or sub-\u03bcM IC 50 against purified HHAT also inhibit Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) palmitoylation in cells and suppress the SHH signaling pathway. This work identifies IMP-1575 as the most potent cell-active chemical probe for HHAT function, alongside an inactive control enantiomer, providing tool compounds for validation of HHAT as a target in cellular assays.\n\n",
