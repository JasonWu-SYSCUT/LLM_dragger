    "abstract": "Lipid binding domains and protein lipidations are essential features to recruit proteins to intracellular membranes, enabling them to function at specific sites within the cell. Membrane association can also be exploited to answer fundamental and applied research questions, from obtaining insights into the understanding of lipid metabolism to employing them for metabolic engineering to redirect fluxes. This review presents a broad catalog of membrane binding strategies focusing on the plasma membrane of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both lipid binding domains (pleckstrin homology, discoidin-type C2, kinase associated-1, basic-rich and bacterial phosphoinositide-binding domains) and co- and post-translational lipidations (prenylation, myristoylation and palmitoylation) are introduced as tools to target the plasma membrane. To provide a toolset of membrane targeting modules, respective candidates that facilitate plasma membrane targeting are showcased including their in vitro and in vivo properties. The relevance and versatility of plasma membrane targeting modules are further highlighted by presenting a selected set of use cases.\n",
