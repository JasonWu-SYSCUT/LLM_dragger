    "abstract": "Catestatin (CST), a versatile 21 amino acid long cationic peptide, is stored in chromaffin granules and exocytosed upon fusion with the plasma membrane. CST, produced by chromaffin cells and neutrophils, is derived from the processing of chromogranin A and induced in the skin after injury. It involves catecholamine inhibition, blood pressure control, inflammation, and innate immunity. It is thought that calcium influx is triggered by CST permeating within neutrophils. It is unknown whether CST can disturb the immediate environment enough to penetrate the cell membrane passively. We used molecular dynamics simulations to examine the behaviour of human CST in its wild-type state (CST WT) and one of its naturally occurring variants, CST-364 S, which has a high allelic frequency in the human population. Both peptides were incorporated into the model eukaryotic cell membrane known as the POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) lipid bilayer. The molecular modelling and simulations results show that CST WT and CST-364 S have different propensities for membrane disruption. It was shown that CST-364 S has higher membrane permeability than CST WT. In addition, we have used fluorescence anisotropy and leakage assay to study the interaction of peptides with PC membranes. Both peptides interacted with POPC and DOPC membranes, while CST-364 S penetrated the membrane more deeply via disorganizing the membrane interface, which supports our previous findings. According to this study, there is a good possibility that the peptides will passively permeate the cell membrane, distort, and pass through it.\n",
