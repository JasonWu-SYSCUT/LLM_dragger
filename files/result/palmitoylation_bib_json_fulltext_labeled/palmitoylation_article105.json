    "abstract": "Cyclic Peptide Nanotubes (CPNTs) have emerged as compelling candidates for various applications, particularly as nanochannels within lipid bilayers. In this study, the stability of two CPNTs, namely 8 x [(Cys-Gly-Met-Gly)(2)] and 8 x [(Gly-Leu)(4)], are comprehensively investigated across different lipid bilayers, including 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), a mixed model membrane (POPE/POPG), and a realistic yeast model membrane. The results demonstrate that both CPNTs maintain their tubular structures in all lipid bilayers, with [(Cys-Gly-Met-Gly)(2)] showing increased stability over an extended period in these lipid membranes. The insertion of CPNTs shows negligible impact on lipid bilayer properties, including area per lipid, volume per lipid, and bilayer thickness. The study demonstrates that the CPNT preserves its two-line water movement pattern within all the lipid membranes, reaffirming their potential as water channels. The MSD curves further reveal that the dynamics of water molecules inside the nanotube are similar for all the bilayer systems with minor differences that arise due to different lipid environments.\n",
