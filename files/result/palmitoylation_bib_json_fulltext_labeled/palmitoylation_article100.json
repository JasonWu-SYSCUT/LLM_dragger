    "abstract": "Radiation exposure poses a significant threat to cellular integrity by inducing DNA damage through the generation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Ascorbic acid, particularly its derivative Palmitoyl Ascorbic Acid 2-Glucoside (PA2G), has demonstrated remarkable radioprotective properties. While previous research focused on its pre-irradiation application, this study explores the post-irradiation radiomitigation potential of PA2G. Our findings reveal that post-irradiation treatment with PA2G enhances cell survival and accelerates DNA repair processes, particularly the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway. Notably, PA2G treatment reduces the frequency of lethal chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei formation, indicating its ability to enhance the repair of complex DNA lesions. Furthermore, PA2G is shown to play a role in potentially lethal damage repair (PLDR). These radioprotective effects are specific to NHEJ and ATM pathways, as cells deficient in these mechanisms do not benefit from PA2G treatment. This study highlights PA2G as a versatile radioprotector, both pre- and post-irradiation, with significant potential for applications in radiation therapy and protection, offering new insights into its mechanism of action. Further research is required to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms underlying PA2G's radiomitigation effects and its potential clinical applications.\n",
