    "abstract": "Sphingolipids are a diverse class of lipids with essential functions as determinants of membrane physical properties and as intra- and intercellular signaling agents. Disruption of the normal biochemical processes that establish the levels of individual sphingolipids is associated with a variety of human diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, skin diseases, and lysosomal storage diseases. A unique aspect of this metabolic network is that there is a single enzymatic step that initiates the biosynthetic pathway for all sphingolipids. This step is catalyzed by the enzyme serine palmitoyltranserase (SPT). Under most circumstances SPT condenses serine and the 16-carbon acyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA to produce the precursor of all sphingolipids. SPT, a four-subunit protein complex, is subject to classic feedback regulation: when cellular sphingolipids are elevated, SPT activity is inhibited. Ceramide is the sphingolipid sensed by this system and it regulates SPT by directly binding to the complex. The ceramide binding site in the SPT complex, and how ceramide binding results in SPT inhibition, has now been determined in vertebrates, plants, and yeast using molecular modeling and cryo-electron microscopy. Here we discuss the similarities and differences revealed by these resolved structures and the surprising result that ceramide binds at almost identical positions in the SPT complex of these divergent organisms, but accomplishes SPT regulation in very different ways.\n",
