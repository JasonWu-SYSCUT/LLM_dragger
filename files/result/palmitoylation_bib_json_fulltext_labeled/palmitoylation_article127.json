    "abstract": "LMNA gene mutation can cause muscular dystrophy, and post-translational modification plays a critical role in regulating its function. Here, we identify that lamin A is palmitoylated at cysteine 522, 588, and 591 residues, which are reversely catalyzed by palmitoyltransferase zinc finger DHHC-type palmitoyltransferase 5 (ZDHHC5) and depalmitoylase alpha/beta hydrolase domain 7 (ABHD7). Furthermore, the metabolite lactate promotes palmitoylation of lamin A by inhibiting the interaction between it and ABHD7. Interestingly, low-level palmitoylation of lamin A promotes, whereas high-level palmitoylation of lamin A inhibits, murine myoblast differentiation. Together, these observations suggest that ABHD7-mediated depalmitoylation of lamin A controls myoblast differentiation.\n",
